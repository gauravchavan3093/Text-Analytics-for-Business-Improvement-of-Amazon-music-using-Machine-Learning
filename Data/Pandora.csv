"April 12, 2016","i love the app and listen to Pandora often. Is there a voice command in my phone that would make changing stations easier? Not sure but I wish there was"
"November 17, 2012","The pp just got an update that really helped smooth out a few problems or limitatikns in had, but its still got a few. Can always build a better mouse trap and all that jazz. Havent had any problems with it just not playing lile other have said. Its also awesome in the fact that it will play even when you hit the sleep button on the kindle fire hd, so you dont have to burn that baterry so much to listen to music."
"August 3, 2013","Very good app, but I wish they would allow for better mix of music like dj mixes. There are other app that give those options, like SoundCloud and FitRadio. It's a bit annoying to receive a message asking if I'm still there listening, like I'm supposed to be holding the phone at all times touching the menu buttons....stop it with the separation anxiety Pandora!!!"
"June 12, 2017","I love the music line up."
"June 7, 2017","Just freezes"
"January 22, 2017","I can change ambiance with a click to shuffle -- change mood at a click of a button. Love it!"
"July 10, 2017","I love Pandora and all the available material they share with listeners...being able to tailor make your own platforms for your preferences is beyong anything most music lovers would require. If you love music this is the site, especially with the option to get rid of the commercials...I highly reccomend this site"
"February 5, 2016","Its good so far wish i could play back my fav songs without going through all the radio stations, but i like the continuous play dont like tht they stop u from skipping"

"March 10, 2016","Great app for students to use in the classroom when they earn positive breaks. I made a teacher login and made appropriate stations for the kids to listen too."
"September 8, 2016","I have found all of the music i thought was gone but not here i thank you for all your hard work i listen all the time"
"February 8, 2014","Amazing variety of free music and for a small monthly fee no ADs. I listen everything from Three Tenors, Bob Marley, CCR, Africa Jazz, Blues, Classical music, B.B King, Eric Clapton, Adel, Lord, Lena Horne to Dancehall Soca. They even have comedy stations. Works wonderfully on cellphones, kindles, tablets, and computers."
"July 25, 2013","Before teens in training bras, braces and socks in pants Pandora was there providing free radio and music that the local top 40 stations couldn't due to fat guys in suits making the rules. Now that the market is flooded with internet music providers, Pandora is still tops. Go Pandora. Even if I have to download an app for my digital manhood I still give them 5stars."
"July 9, 2015","I would love to rate Pandora better,but sometimes it works,other times it sticks and drains my battery.I love the variety of music Pandora plays.Please fix the kinks,Until you do I will not pay for radio free Pandora."
"January 3, 2014","I like this cause it plays based on taste and helps with channels for styles of music and variety of the time as you can select channels listen or not pending your mood to listen to what. Christmas jazz or rock and roll current. Oldies. I have it all and listen to what I like. Only down side is I cannot get it when I visit Canada."
"December 5, 2014","Used this app for years, and I'm sick of telling it to skip tracks all the time. I'm tired of it trying to play genres of music that absolutely don't belong in the channels I create. Overpriced app that tends to play music you don't like. Play quality is good."
"December 27, 2016","Great stations and good music could be less ads but it's not to bad love the thumbnail chanel"
"July 19, 2016","Great music station without to many commercials. It works with bluetooth to stream music to a speaker which you can use anywhere."
"November 12, 2014","dad likes it"
"November 29, 2015","Long time Pandora user and happy to have this app available for my new Microsoft Lumia 950! I have experienced no issues with this app and look forward to continued Pandora enjoyment."
"November 28, 2014","Gotta love pandora. Like a dream come true right? Create your own stations based on your own favorite songs. Skip a song if you don't like it or not in the mood? Does it get any better? How did I live without it? Besides what a way to get in the zone when working?"
"September 20, 2013","Pandora is a lot of fun. I love the fact that you can personalize the music you listen to by adding in an artist of your choice. However, I do have one complaint. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes you get music that shouldn't even be categorized next to a genre. If I type in ""Disturbed,"" I don't want ""Britney Spears."" Period."
"January 5, 2015","Pandora is wonderful, you have to train your stations just a little at first, but once you do it's fabulous. Much better than Spotify's radio function which offers little variety. It's obvious how much time and care they put into the music genome project."
"May 13, 2017","Every good"
"July 27, 2017","Just love this service."
"July 28, 2017","IT RARELY PLAYS MUSIC!!! CAN'T GET IT TO PLAY ON MY CAR BLOOTHOOTH"
"January 2, 2017","Wonderful! So much music and so many memories brought back by great music. So easy to use."
"December 18, 2016","I love Pandora. Don't mind the Ads, either. All works for me. I play on my tablet or laptop."
"January 13, 2017","I like it it is really Good and you need to add more stations please I love Pandora so much."
"May 4, 2015","Listen to it every day."
"September 23, 2014","I absolutely love it.🐷"
"June 2, 2016","All was well"
"July 9, 2015","love it....."
"September 4, 2017","I am happy to hear some of my favorite tunes! Not so much for the commercials"
"January 29, 2014","I absolutely love this app. After getting your favorite groups and songs into and as playlists start telling it which songs you like and don't. As the Alger rhythm goes along the playlists start to become just about right on target for what you want. Only throwing in the odd song that makes no sense. Most definitely worth it."
"June 13, 2017","Would not let me sign up, never got to try it out"
"July 18, 2017","I love this app,I can listen to music that I like"
"September 29, 2017","love it.."
"October 13, 2017","wonderful way to add music to my day."
"December 20, 2016","I only wish there weren't commercials, but I understand that to get this free you need them"
"January 18, 2017","The app was not compatible with the Kindle I had - very difficult to finally figure it out."
"May 7, 2016","It's great to hear exactly the music I like without wasting time configuring things.  Discovering new artists and songs is also great."
"February 20, 2015","I love Pandora, but am sometimes frustrated, when a song isn't finished before it flows into the next one. I also get frustrated when the volume from one station is different than the next. One minute it's a nice volume, the next song is LOUD!"
"September 29, 2016","My favorite go-to music streaming app for probably going on a decade now, and still getting better and better."
"January 10, 2016","I love this app. I listen to music like all the time. I purchased the app for my Kindle Fire and it works great. Now I can have just the music I want anywhere in my house."
"January 20, 2015","App works terrific,awesome,but their is always one problem. When I go to another app or just go to the Internet. It wont let me change the song, to another track. I thought you could do that along time ago . Anyways I'll rate five if problem is fixed"
"March 29, 2016","It shuts its self off to much."
"August 21, 2013","Of course Pandora is great, but after one song plays, I have to unlock my phone and wait for the next song to load, or rather, a commercial and then the next song. Kind of inconvenient. And many more commercials than the regular version of Pandora. I don't mind listening to an occasional commercial now and then, but literally every other song is a bit much."
"July 11, 2014","I have been using Pandora since pretty close to when it first came out for PC. I got Pandora one a few years later...back then it was one of the only apps that did music streaming in the way it does, but even with newer services available from other companies. I still use Pandora . Love it"
"January 21, 2014","I love Pandora, great variety and super easy to set up stations. You can have multiple based on different types of music or mix all kinds of music together into one station. It is easy to change around stations as well just by adding new artists to the starting list for that station. Great to have on as background for work."
"February 21, 2015","Excellent! Love it."
"December 8, 2012","When I first listened to Pandora, I was impressed. They played the type of music that I enjoy. But whenever a song come on that I don't quite like, I just tell Pandora by using the ""thumbs down"" button. Then, I don't ever hear that song again.  I have gotten hooked on this app because it is like a personal radio. If you are a music lover (like myself) then you will love this free app."
"January 5, 2017","I love Pandora"
"June 2, 2016","Great music"
"October 15, 2016","OMG I LOVE PANDORA N JANGO ,THEY ARE BOTH GREAT, I LOVE MUSIC N THESE 2 STATIONS RATES A 5 CK THEM OUT."
"November 21, 2015","I've enjoyed Pandora for a long time!"
"April 25, 2016","Works like the Pandora on my phone! I downloaded it, fired up my smoker, and listened to Blues music while smoking dinner and drinking Tennessee Whiskey."
"August 12, 2015","Works as it should :)"
"August 23, 2016","Works great, exposure to new music with similar aspects of what you like. It's a great feature to expand your groove."
"January 28, 2014","I decided to give it another go. Works wonderfully now. Thanks for the fix, whatever it was. =)  This app worked awesome for the first cpl days I had it. Then it.froze and wouldn't load.......ever. I redownloaded the app, it worked for a day, then the same thing. It froze again. I gave up and went to I heart radio."
"February 2, 2014","I love the software. I have it loaded on my tablet, my Computer, my Laptop, My phone, My Blu-Ray player (Bedroom), My Smart TV (Living Room). I can set it for the one artist, or use the shuffle mode to play all of my favorite artists.  The only draw back is that the interfaces are very different on every device."
"November 2, 2017","I love Pandora radio."
"June 19, 2017","excelent"
"April 4, 2013","I love having music and a variety of it. I don't buy cds or anything anymore and the regular radio plays too much of the same things or have too many commercials/talk shows. I may have the free version but the commercials really are not intrusive and I can easily look over it. I like to be surprised with songs that I love but may not have heard in awhile or didn't know who did them."
"April 29, 2016","I dont really like the app.it doesnt give me music I want it putsusic like that I really recommend getting spotify Ii lets u get the music u want"
"December 31, 2016","Love Pandora music, just a bit annoyed by pop up ads, but use to it and usually ignore it."
"January 18, 2017","Super. I love all the songs in my chosen category. Hope you have one in the philippines!!!"
"May 3, 2016","I really like it when it will play, but it stops after it's been playing for 10 minutes and then it plays for a few seconds and shuts off again."
"May 11, 2016","this is amazing! I get to listen to all my jams, the only thing I don't like is the ads. it disrupts my music. but other than that. I live it!"
"April 30, 2015","I have Pandora on my phone, on my Fire TV stick, and on my Kindle. I use it everywhere. I use it on my phone, when I travel, to avoid having to find a good radio station. I use it on my Fire TV stick while I'm cleaning or cooking. Using the sleep timer on my Kindle, I can play one of my ""sleeping"" stations, which helps me fall asleep quickly. This is the best thing since iPods, for me."
"December 28, 2014","I'm sorry but I recommend iheart radio. It is so much better. Pandora always freezes when I want to hear a song advertisements pop up and end clicking that instead of a thumps up or down. Iheart radio is simple and easy. But then again it's not my choice"
"May 26, 2016","So far I'm very happy with it but I am brand new to it too so I will hold out to give it 5 stars until I've had a chance to really use it!"
"December 9, 2016","I enjoyed the music very much and would recommend Pandora for all music lovers. It is great."
"December 30, 2015","Its a good app, but cant get it to where I can have my profile picture on it, does anybody know how? It shows the facebook thing but everytime I log in it still wont let me"
"February 6, 2016","Listen to this on a regular basis. It's not perfect, but can't be beat for the price - free. A couple of 10 second commercials every hour are not a problem for me."
"June 21, 2017","Love the ability to create channels"
"June 25, 2017","Good mix of music and very limited commercials."
"July 22, 2017","Love it"
"August 4, 2017","Love it"
"December 31, 2016","We love having the choice to continuously play the stations we love without interruption."
"December 31, 2013","Pandora is my first app on my new kindle fire HD and i absloutely love it! Awesome music, awesome choices!!"
"December 28, 2014","Just getting started with Pandora. So far I really like it, but have only scratched the surface. Got an IHome wireless speaker for my Kindle Fire HDX so I can not have music I like wherever I like. There are commercials, but are not terribly annoyin."
"February 5, 2014","I have been a Pandora user for quite some time. I use it on all my computers at home and at my office. I appreciate the fact that I can input the artists and style of music I prefer. If something is played I would rather not listen to again I can input that fact. I can listen to my playlist randomly, or select a particular artist/style to play. I recently upgraded to a Kindle Fire HDX, and can now play music while I'm reading or anything else I may be doing on the Kindle. I have tried several other downloadable music sites, and have found Pandora to be the most versatile and have the greatest choice of music as well as being the easiest to use."
"January 1, 2015","awesome"
"August 16, 2017","I love hearing my favorite tunes."
"February 4, 2013","Panadora is one of my favorite FREE apps. I use this app all the time when working out, and I love the variety of music they have for free on here! I just downloaded this to my Kindle as my son loves music and now he can listen to it on the kindle as well! Other than the ""Pop and Hip Hop Power workout"" station playin OLDIES (not sure why this is) I have no issues and love Pandora!"
"November 10, 2015","Pandora is a great app for music play. Upside is that you can create any list you want .... down side is that there is not enough different music added to your selected playlist type."
"September 13, 2013","This is really great sound. What a concept! Just start a station off and it keeps adding same genre songs. Tired of that genre, start another station off and it keeps building, too. Tomorrow want some of the same, then maybe something different, start another station, or start an old one. Thumbs down those songs you don't want and they are gone. Thumbs up those to tweak the selections of the future songs. Great deal, and no advertisements. I definitely recommend!"
"February 16, 2016","I like the service but find the app not very intuitive in terms of use. Perhaps a link to instructions on how best to set up your own channels would be helpful."
"December 10, 2012","I guess that's the point of free versus subscription service, but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer-based commercials, now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating, to say the least."
"May 16, 2017","Just love it"
"June 2, 2016","Very good"
"April 25, 2016","Every song I choose or radio artist..Is awesome..Its great to hear songs you remember as a Rockin young person,and is just as fun now to listen!"
"October 22, 2013","I have Pandora on my iphone and my laptop. I love listening to what I want while I'm cooking dinner. It's a great app."
"December 3, 2016","at first it didnt work right, cork left in bottle, however now it works perfectly. love it."
"August 24, 2013","I've only had this app for a week and already problems! Worked like a charm until I had it exactly one week then it refused to load further than the blue Pandora screen! I completely removed it deleted the purchase and downloaded again for it to only do the same thing the next day! I hope this is just a bug that can be worked out because I love Pandora!"
"January 31, 2016","I have reinstalled Pandora several different times on my Kindle Fire and I still cannot get it to play, whether it's Bluetooth or not. Is there a trick to this????"
"July 20, 2016","I have been using Pandora Radio for years, I love the stations I have created and I'm always surprised at the song choices they suggest, hidden treasures or forgotten favorites!"
"December 15, 2016","I enjoy the selection of music gendra. I turn on Pandora and listen all day to the music"
"January 14, 2013","I use the app all the time. Works great on my phone and Tablet. Can't live without it! Easy to install and free!"
"November 17, 2012","Pandora app is the best! If you love music and you simply want some relaxation music or want to get up and dance, Pandora has it all. The sound on the Kindle Fire HD is simply a knock out. Cannot believe that sound comes out of that thin piece of amazement!!!! Truly, I recommend getting the full version of this app. It is not much and is totally worth it.  Thanks to Pandora and amazon.com."
"March 29, 2013","I have the free version. Every now and then it asks if you are still listening and/or you hear a few ads, but I don't find it annoying enough to upgrade and pay monthly for it. The genre picked does tend to play the same songs over and over, but there are many options to choose from and change the genre playing to change up the songs whenever you want. Can't beat it for free!!??"
"June 3, 2016","Good App"
"February 6, 2015","Works as expected"
"May 18, 2016","I absolutely love Pandora! We are constantly playing it in my home when it is time to do some housework...and I play it at work some too."
"September 19, 2016","I have been listening to Pandora fr years now and the mix is great. I have approximately 20 channels defined."
"May 26, 2016","I love that I get to listen to whatever I want whenever I want. The music quality is as good as I want to make it. PANDORA is EXCELLENT!"
"August 1, 2015","Stopped working immediately and had to call Pandora. Next use was equal to one song at a time. After screwing with it for way too long, just changed to a different streaming program. What a waste of time"
"January 31, 2013","well you cant go wrong with Pandora in the first place. Awesome music, the lyrics to sing by and easy to use"
"August 1, 2015","Being able to pick ""stations"" for your favorite music means very little you dislike, though Pandora limits the number of pieces you can skip through, and there are ads unless you pay to avoid them."
"September 27, 2017","I Love It !!! Listen all day at work, makes the day a whole lot easier !!"
"May 23, 2017","I want to cancel the subscription to stop the payment and it won't let me"
"March 20, 2013","This app has always made advances with internet radio and doesn't disappoint. It's very rare that there are issues with the app or the connection (as long as you have a good WiFi connection of course). You can set up your own channels and listen to everything from rock to classical to comedy bits.  An excellent app that everyone should have, in my opinion.  -D"
"November 29, 2016","Love using Pandora. It has great variety and I am able to even hook into it on my cable box."
"March 10, 2016","Really wonderful that is adapts to play music that you like. The only problem is it has loading problems. It can take a long time to start the next song."
"January 29, 2017","I am a big fan of Pandora and listen to it often. The app works very well.and was free."
"January 23, 2017","Fun to create your own ""stations"" and Pandora does well in selecting the tunes."
"January 1, 2017","This App was installed on the daughter's new 8"" Fire HD and she likes it very much."
"January 5, 2017","Love Pandora, hate the still listening and ads but I just too cheap to upgrade, Oh well"
"August 24, 2014","The music I want to hear...free. :)"
"January 23, 2014","I have just applied Pandora and really do like it. I plan to utilize this item to a great extent."
"January 8, 2014","Always enjoy my Pandora. Now that I have a mini Bose blue tooth speaker it's even better. I listen tall all my favorite channels at home and now at work. I have the premium Pandora with no commercials. It's wonderful. Mozart to Joe Walsh to Muddy Water. What a way to listen to uninterpreted music all day long."
"February 20, 2016","I love my Pandora, it is the best next to amazon music... I use it all of the time, it helps me when I am cleaning keeps me going... Wide variety of music..."
"November 22, 2016","Four stars because of advertising, would be better without ads and no charge to remove them !"
"November 15, 2015","Pandora is overall a great listening station. I mean, you can't get any better than free. Even better, every device linked with one account will share the same stations. If I had one thing to say, it's the ads. About 2 of them come on every 2-3 songs. And considering the fact that the same ads play all the time, it can get quite irritating. Great app though. :)"
"October 22, 2015","You don't get something for nothing. This works but I've read that it enables personal information to be sent to the company about your habits, contacts, pictures, etc. I took it off."
"February 27, 2014","Awesome app. Really wish the kindle version didn't take off the sleep timer though. I miss that feature, can't fall asleep to the music anymore because I have to wake up to turn it off. Sigh. Other than that I love this for everything else. Music is in everything I breathe and Pandora almost always plays my moods."
"July 18, 2017","I love me some PANDORA would not change for anything unless it's better."
"April 16, 2014","So enjoy the variety and easy of use. I carry it with me and it helps me keep working. Thanks!!!!"
"November 3, 2015","Last update does not allow you to stop playing your music, stop playing, skip a song, nor like or dislike it unless you are inside the app. Plus it stops playing by itself randomely."
"July 18, 2017","Don't know they would not except my account."
"August 24, 2017","Good"
"April 7, 2015","Pandora is awesome. It is free music. Type in a song, album or artist and you get that plus similar music. And its all for free? I use it for Moon Hooch and Mickey Avalon radio. Better than radio, satellite and Youtube for music."
"February 25, 2015","The app does what it is meant to, open a direct link to your Pandora account. It doesn't do anything else because it doesn't have too. You could accomplish the same effect by creating a short cut, but I find this slightly more convenient."
"July 14, 2013","This was my 1st app on my new KFHD & I love it. The device has good speakers & w/Pandora you can program your favorites. Wish there were no audio ads but the app was free so why complain?! I had to go to Amazon's Kindle support to figure out where it was on my KFHD once I downloaded it but that's not the fault of the app. Pleased to have it & esp at no cost."
"August 29, 2013","I love the pandora. It's easy to use and works great. I would yell anyone that ask me that they will love it."
"August 24, 2014","Greatest ever"
"September 17, 2015","Really enjoyed the new app, as my wife has been using Pandora for years now. I love the various categories of music which allows you to play tailor towards your favorites. I waited too long."
"January 1, 2015","I love their service of providing super music all the time. I love these dedicated stations of mine. The three main ones are early classical (when I'm working), piano jazz when I'm doing light tasks and driving, and classical guitar while dining."
"September 13, 2016","Constant good music, always accessible, for all occasions! Makes it enjoyable to listen all day a and night."
"April 8, 2016","I liked the music but it took over my phone and would not let me turn it off. I had to contact mayday to fix it, then I removed it from my phone."
"May 2, 2017","Not available in South Africa, such a pity!"
"March 28, 2014","Music is great, but nothing in life is free. A few to many commercials. Some times I struggle to find stop button. They call it quit"
"December 9, 2013","Pandora has become my go to place to experience new music. I'm still old school enough to find an artist I like and then buy the CD (soon I'll be buying the vinyl). The Pandora app runs great on my Kindle Fire, so now I find myself doing more ""music research"" when laying in bed before I turn the lights out for the night."
"January 31, 2017","Although I basicly stay on one channel it is awesome, they always play the best songs"
"December 31, 2014","I enjoy listening to the mix of music that happens as Pandora interprets my likes and dislikes. It is very easy to use, easy to pick your own type of music, and easy to say 'I don't like that' when something is introduced that grates on my nerves."
"December 29, 2016","It used to be a lot better. They still play good music but have too many commercials"
"January 7, 2017","I guess after you get good with it, it may be good. Until then it is quite difficult."
"September 5, 2016","Pandora used to be good, until they added strict limits on how many songs you could skip during the whole day and shoved a commercial down your throat every other song. There's way better options out there."
"June 3, 2016","Great"
"December 7, 2013","It works for me. I love it. I live in an apartment building and my neighbors say they hear Pandora coming from my apt. and love the music. Some also use it. I'm 66 years old and find it difficult to listen to my car radio. There is less music on the car radio then ever before. I like having choices and with Pandora you do."
"January 28, 2014","I like that I can select the songs and artists that I like to listen to, and I can give songs it ads that are similar a thumbs up or down. Also I can listen to Pandora while I play games on my Kindle fire. Thanks to my grandson for telling me about Pandora as he also uses it, and he showed me how to use it. Love it."
"July 7, 2016","Love this app. I know its been around for years now but I just decided to check it out. Love customizing my own stations."
"April 1, 2014","I enjoyed using this program until they raised the price of the service. It is a one of a kind program because I could develope the music folks I listen to most offen. Now I just stream the general music I like. The Pandora music program is still free to use but with advertising coming on every so often."
"October 9, 2013","I didn't realize how much I would enjoy the Pandora app. I carry my Kindle from room to room or out on the porch and have constant, great music that I like. No more tuning in a radio. Really like that it identifies the artist - there are songs I've heard before but didn't know who was singing. Just this app alone makes the Kindle worth it!"
"June 8, 2013","I like this very much. Its a little hard to figure out how to work it. Are there any instructions? Don't know where they are. But the fact is once you get it started, its really terrific. The music fits my choices exactly. They know what I like better than I do. Very enjoyable on my Kindle Fire. Nice to make good use of really good sound on the Kindle Fire."
"August 8, 2015","Thank you for fixing. We are going back to 5 stars. PANDORA!!! Have you even noticed the comments since your last update? Hope you are working on a fix. Thanks for bringing me music before that."
"January 7, 2017","love it so far, still trying to learn what it can do and understand how to do things"
"July 22, 2015","I Downloaded Pandora on my Kindle and instantly fell In love. I work on the beach and this is my go to app for music from every genre. I love how it let's you create your own station. At anytime you can pick up my Kindle and Pandora will be on."
"December 31, 2015","This is my favorite music app everrrrr I use it all the time, LITTERALLY. 😃 I recommend this app for anyone looking for a free, good working, efficient app!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"March 8, 2016","For Christmas, 2015, I received a great gift of a Kindle Fire tablet, as well as a really nice headset.. I recently discovered Pandora and was very pleased with the site. I e;njoyed exploring Pandora and setting up ""stations"" for future listening. I am most impressed with the classical selections on Pandora. I know I will come back to the site over and over to see what's new."
"November 5, 2015","We listened to Pandora all the way from Oregon to Palm Springs instead of Sirius. It was absolutely amazing and so enjoyable. And let's not forget how much less expensive it is."
"July 18, 2017","Outstanding program !!!!!!!"
"June 21, 2016","I love Pandora. It allows me to listen to all the music I like whether on one station or several stations. Absolutely love it."
"March 12, 2016","I Love it! I listen to it all day at work and just recently downloaded it to my phone. I can pick the music I feel in the mood for. 5 stars from me."
"January 27, 2016","Pandora is a great app, although I prefer I Heart Radio, as it doesn't need Wi-Fi. I am able to create stations and playlists of my favorite music, which allows me to simply click on my favorite Irish playlists, and hear my favorite drinking songs! I love this app!"
"August 22, 2017","So far so good with setting up, selecting, and playing."
"January 1, 2014","In the short amount of time I spent on Pandora the first time, I was able to find a mess of songs and artists that I enjoy. Now I just need the time to go back for more. I couldn't find my favorite Christmas CD at home, but found some pleasant music to listen to on a very snowy holiday complete with a crackling fire !!!"
"May 23, 2017","Says ""unable to play music"" ALL the time. Vary disappointed."
"November 20, 2015","I live this .. I don't listen to the radio very much but this is wonderful to have. I can determine what will be my regular songs & what will be the songs I don't want to hear"
"August 5, 2016","Love, love, love having someone else choose music for me. I pick a style I want to hear, and Pandora does the rest."
"March 24, 2013","One of the main reasons for buying my Kindle Fire was so I could listen to Pandora in my house through my stereo and also out in my shop through another stereo. It works very well. It is not quite as user friendly as the one on my Macbook but I think with a little time I will learn new tricks and shortcuts. I am very happy with it overall and very grateful to get it for free."
"September 13, 2016","Almost anything you want. Even ...Mother's of Invention...best part.. No messing around start it ,it plays"
"September 6, 2017","Avail on many devices. Good selection of stations. Easy access. So far no problems."
"September 11, 2017","Overall - Great. Could use a little more material. Start to hear several repeats."
"August 3, 2015","Good music, like being able to select favorites and skip songs, but the ads are loud and annoying. I use this to play lullabies to my daughter and inevitably a commercial will come on and wake her up."
"January 3, 2015","Really happy with this app. Add stations then shuffle, couldn't be easier to customize the music."
"December 2, 2016","I enjoy having music that I create playlist stations for at my disposal. Love this app!"
"April 16, 2015","Awesome app. Free version works great. If you don't mind the commercials every now and then, I see no reason to purchase the paid version. Great for getting to know similar or new bands that relate to bands you already know."
"December 26, 2015","This is technically an app but this is amazing if you like music and if you're always busy and want to listen to music when you're doing something.... I LOVE THIS APP"
"September 4, 2017","Love the selection of music"
"May 4, 2017","excellent music. use a lot."
"May 9, 2014","I'm sorry that I couldn't make this any better but it doesn't do what I thought it was supposed to do. I wanted to make a play list with an artist. But all this would do is play one selection by the artist and then it started playing other artists that I never heard of...not for me any longer..."
"March 7, 2014","I have had a Pandora account for a longtime but had not used it in quite a while. When I downloaded it on my new Droid XX, I found it very annoying because the ads out number the music. I found the monthly fee to avoid the ads to be twice as high as it should be. In the past I paid $15 for a subscription."
"January 18, 2013","Great site with extended and complete information about songs and artist. Unfortunetly too much advertisment, but the service is excellent."
"October 15, 2016","Like it a lot lots of music choices and really easy to use very happy with it don't change a thing"
"March 18, 2014","This is an awesome App to purchase if you are looking for a music App that learns as you check whether you like the song it plays at the time. You can create individual band name folders and click thumbs up or thumbs down to make your selection for that individual band you have named each folder you are listening to. It learns as you make your selections and narrows the music it plays until it eventually plays nothing but the band name you picked for each folder. If you want to narrow your search even more you can create folders for specific album names for the band you select. I very highly recommend this App."
"March 16, 2014","This service replaces my XM radio. Preferring to go ad less I have tried the 1 month free trial and will continue based on my experience so far . I have created my own stations and tuned in the stations created by genre. These have been very satisfactory. Even paying for premium service it is less than Xm."
"April 17, 2014","I thoroughly enjoy listening to Pandora. I can listen to any of my favorite artists anytime, anyplace day or night. It is such a great way to carry my favorite music with me anywhere. Get on board. Its' a must have.!!"
"June 24, 2016","I am a music lover. Pandora plays great music based on your choice of performers. Songs played that I hadn't heard in years."
"October 22, 2016","Pandora carries most of the music selections I like and the commercials/advertisements are short"
"February 16, 2015","Love it..."
"November 5, 2014","I used to have Apollo (Pandora Radio Client) on my Blackberry playbook and got used to it especially it got no advertisement. Now with Pandora I got the same good music but ads are there. It works great on my Blackberry Passport and I highly recommend it."
"April 26, 2013","This is a great app for those who love music. Works great on any device and I is easy to use."
"January 3, 2017","NICE TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT I LISTEN TO!"
"December 1, 2012","I use this app on all my devices and I bought a polaroid 8 in tablet for both of my children for christmas. I decided to open one to test it out and this app doesn't work. It loads but never plays the music. It just constantly changes the song and never plays. I deleted and re-downloaded the app and the same thing happened. I will open the other tablet on christmas and see if it works then."
"July 29, 2017","It doesn't offer what I thought it would"
"June 14, 2016","I like the idea of selecting my own music. It is free. If I like an album I can buy it on Pandora. The variety is outstanding."
"November 2, 2017","I love it you should try it so time all it need in a phone and it is easy like 123"
"January 24, 2017","Pandora has my music choices and really like to send it on the bluetooth speakers."
"January 14, 2014","I bought this by reading the great comments and every single time that I login and just keep it on I actually try to just click it and when I do it says loading and it won't go on. Multiple times I download it again and it works the first time and after that it does the same things. This is now my 7th time getting it."
"August 14, 2017","Great station"
"September 18, 2014","A big fan of free radio. Could do with less commercials, but I love the customization options it offers. One bug fix I would love to see though, is that on the Kindle Fire HD it won't work with other apps open, even the Silk browser. Other than that, it's perfect!"
"August 15, 2014","We love the variety of music and the ability to choose genres."
"June 26, 2014","Decided it would be easier to take my music with me this way versus a radio. Downloaded the free app and listened to it on 3 nights to fall asleep with my country music. I already have it on my Android smartphone but it drains my battery when I use it on there. It works fabulously."
"April 22, 2013","Love pandora as a service and use across other devices as well, but this app needs to be smoothed out for the kindle fire HD. It often won't shut off (or become mute) when closing the cover, and it also hampers the use of other apps while running simultaneously.  It's free, and I trust they'll work out the flaws eventually. Until then it gets three stars..."
"March 29, 2016","Listen to every day. Use the alarm clock to wake with music"
"July 18, 2016","Love my Blues entertainment every night and playing it with my guitar."
"December 31, 2012","I have an ecclectic taste in music and love my Budha Bar station and chill stations as well as, my New Age Instrumental and other things as well, like Ambient, Dance Electronic or Smooth Jazz. such good stuff!  I am a soft skills and technical trainer and play Pandora during my participants breaks and through lunch. The class often asks about the music and where can they get it!"
"December 9, 2014","Love the convenience and variety. Wish site was easier to navigate however perhaps it's just me. I have an old I pod on a player that now thanks to Pandora provides all the best music in my sewing room where good radio reception was not available."
"November 25, 2015","Pandora is awesome and you can put it on any device that you own. It is the 'boombox' of 2015. Love it and it brings the past music era's into the here and now. Love it!"
"June 14, 2015","I use it every day, on my phone and on my computer at work, but it's gotten to the point where the ads are getting to be too much. I briefly considered going to ad free listening. But last year it was $3.99 a month, and now it's bumped up to $4.99 a month. Uh... no thank you."
"June 8, 2015","I love Pandora.. The fact that I can choose what I want to listen to and subscribe for commercial free music for such a cheap price is awesome... Satellite radio is expensive and you don't get to choose anything"
"January 24, 2016","This app is completely useful instead of having to go on YouTube and searching for your favorite song I guarantee your favorite song will come on with Pandora"
"November 7, 2013","Love it because I just type in an artist I like and it somehow knows what other artist I like and I can listen to it without many ads at all. I can shuffle my stations and listen to all the music genres I like together . The only thing I don't like is it plays too many live versions of songs and I'd rather hear the studio version."
"July 7, 2014","Love my Pandora radio! I have several radio stations I have created that did t my changing desires in music. The ads are short, provide a little break and I don't mind them, nothing like commercial radio and announcers constant blabbering, just constant music with brief interludes."
"June 16, 2013","Fast download and used right away. It immediately played songs that I love and new songs to add to my favorites. I appreciate the option to ""like"" and ""dislike"" songs so that Pandora can track what kind of music I want to listen to and create better playlists. Commercials are not big deal. How else would you get this great music app for free?"
"March 19, 2014","I love Pandora as i can customize my own station. I can also make multiple stations for those days when I want to listen to Country and the other days where I need a little spiritual music in my ear. You can dislike and like songs as you go along to build up your playlist. Love this app for my Kindle."
"September 22, 2017","Have been with Pandora for years & if it's music, Pandora's got it!"
"February 17, 2016","I still love pandora! I have prime, and google play. but I still use pandora about... 1/3 of the time. it's nice to have it totally on autopilot!"
"January 18, 2016","I love Pandora for both work and home. I do wish it had less commercials and I had a tad more control over songs, but I have it for free so no real complaints!"
"June 24, 2017","Can't beat it for its variety and ease."
"October 25, 2017","Like my play list. Although they are not able to pull in all the music I request."
"December 26, 2016","Love pandora. Ads pop up here and there but i dnt find them invasive or annoying."
"February 11, 2017","Pandora is a great app for listening to the type of music that you like. Love it!"
"September 6, 2017","Enjoy, enjoy"
"February 14, 2016","Couldn't get the app to play on my kindle"
"August 4, 2013","It deserves a 5 star rating because there is nothing out there like it. could there be some improvements now that i have experienced for years now, yes. but they are very small. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of hearing the insulting to your intelligence commercials and are tired of hearing the same 10 songs played over and over again."
"September 2, 2016","It's free and plays great music tailored to the person's preference, it does not get any better than that."
"March 13, 2013","I love Pandora. I have found stations that I probably wouldn't look for otherwise and genres that compliment the mood I am in. I also like the shuffle feature when I'm not sure what I want to listen to knowing it will be something that I like. This is one of the first apps I added. Knew I had to have this one!"
"March 3, 2016","Not only do I listen to the artists I love but the suggestions by Pandora have opened me up to artists I would never have been exposed to otherwise."
"January 19, 2016","I listen to cajun french music and they play cajun music and I get to pick with thumbs up or thumbs down which songs I like and they play those type of songs."
"May 12, 2016","Love it. They have so many different genre's of Music and you can also make your own list. I have had it for a long time on my phone"
"June 7, 2016","Pandora is amazing it has all the music I like. Pandora is the best music app to get on papyri stor or the app stir."
"July 19, 2016","Use Pandora all the time at work where there is no radio without interference great music pick it save it it's yours"
"March 13, 2014","I love using pandora personally, but when I use it for a kids station, I don't like that the commercials are sometimes questionable, or strange topics for kids to overhear. For example, on the Radio for Kids station, there is an egg donation commercial that comes on often that has spurred odd questions."
"December 8, 2016","I love it. I have not invested in the ad free version however I am considering it."
"September 24, 2017","App, works well. No problems at all, two thumbs up!!"
"August 31, 2016","Pandora is so accommodating. I love being able to design my own stations to my liking. Thanks Pandora"
"September 22, 2017","The app is constantly stopping, I have to restart it all day long."
"December 7, 2016","Awesome music selection. Listen to this a lot while doing other work on my laptop."
"January 25, 2017","I have enjoyed Pandora on my laptop. It was exciting to also have it on my Fire!"
"January 18, 2017","It's all the music I like, made especially for me. Plus it's free. love Pandora."
"March 1, 2013","This is a great app for the tablet and phone. It is by far the best way to stream music."
"June 17, 2016","Pandora is great. It offers a wide variety of music! I love how I can mix my favorite music together and set it to shuffle."
"February 5, 2013","Pandora is great because I can choose the type of music I am listening to according to my ""mood for the day."" When I am studying I can listen to smooth jazz, when I need inspiration I can listen to Rich Mullins, when I am feeling mellow I can listen to James Taylor, when i need a lift I can listen to Big Band or Beach Boys. The songs are varied and fit the genre I choose."
"July 13, 2017","love it !!!"
"May 31, 2017","Still working on figuring it out So far...it's nice."
"January 2, 2015","Great"
"August 22, 2017","Great song great clarity"
"September 21, 2017","Best for internet radio."
"May 17, 2016","Thought music was free like Nook. Unless I missed something, you needed to add to ""cart."" What's with that? Am I wrong?"
"February 5, 2016","Had it before. Very good selection of songs as,well as similar within the genre. Easy to use. Excellent sound quality. Outshines Sirius by a wide margin."
"September 25, 2013","I can pick my style of music and hear just what I want, when I want it. Based on my keep or reject choices, Pandora will then send me a song according to my interest, If I don't like the next song I reject it and they won't ever play that song again. Eventually you build your own station and can share your music with others. It a keeper"
"November 26, 2016","Works great. I love Pandora, its the best free music app I've found. Would recommend."
"September 30, 2013","Having the ability to move from format to format, both nationally and internationally, in a matter of seconds is a value that goes beyond words. My stations and format includes broadcasters and artists from ""Down Under"" as well as high atop the Andes Mountains. The next car I buy I would like to make sure Pandora is installed!"
"January 17, 2013","My taste in music is pretty diverse. Every genre of music I've searched has been able to be located on Pandora. I would recommend it to anyone who wants music on the go."
"May 24, 2017","Always listen to Pandora at home love the selection"
"May 3, 2017","Wish I could add music to what I already listen to."
"September 8, 2017","love this app.. just hate that i have to pay for no commercials.."
"May 24, 2016","Great app but has some limitations. I tend to use Spotify more often than Pandora because you can save songs to your own files."
"February 10, 2017","Love Pandora, have it now on my new Fire tablet because I use it on my I Phone."
"August 21, 2017","Love this app. Use it at every party!"
"December 26, 2016","Best music options ever....Love it...and you can't beat the price.....!!!!....."
"April 7, 2013","I enjoy the freedom of listening to music types I like through my cellphone or computer. Overall I enjoy listening to the artist I choose and the simular artists. I would prefer though a little heavier emphasis on my chosen artist within the mix. I was introduced to Pandora by my daughter a few weeks ago and have very much enjoyed the listening experience. Thank you."
"August 17, 2016","Works great on the Fire TV Stick. Less complicated to use than Pandora app through my tablet and Chromecast."
"August 10, 2016","I love that I can find the stations I am in the mood for. It's easy to use. The reason for only 3 stars is that I have it installed on my phone, and sometimes it kicks on by itself. It doesn't matter if I'm at work, or school or in the middle of the night. I won't be using my phone and all of a sudden I start hearing music. Since I always have my volume up so I can hear my phone, when Pandora comes on, it is loud! If that were fixed so it wouldn't randomly start playing, I would give it 5 stars."
"June 26, 2016","I already loved this app. Only problem I have with it is when it keeps losing signal when it's sitting in the same spot."
"March 27, 2015","I've got Pandora on my phone, my tablet and my desktop. It has helped me through countless midnight shifts and is a great background for cleaning my palatial suite. =8-) Hey, it's gotta be done, right? 5 stars all the way."
"June 4, 2016","I have Pandora on my phone and love it thought I would get it for my k I'll idle fire since amazon music is not easy to use."
"February 3, 2014","This app finds music to fit my mood. When I want Strauss waltzes, I can hear only waltzes. When I want easy listening, that's what I get. I choose thumbs up or down for each piece of music, and the station gives more of the type I want. There are commercials, but they are fewer than a local radio station."
"May 2, 2015","I find it fun to listen to. It does use up your battery pretty fast though. Also, is regularly skips songs when I don't want it to. Also, it signed me up for pandora one all by itself and I don't know how to get out."
"March 29, 2016","No bluegrass music"
"July 22, 2017","I absolutely love music"
"July 18, 2015","This app is so amazing! You chose the music and stations you like for free with little commercials! I listen to it all the time when I'm cleaning,working, or just when I'm board. Great app for music."
"February 14, 2016","App doesn't work with Kindle Fire and website direct refuses to work unless app installed. Apparently it use to work back in the day, but not anymore."
"September 25, 2015","I think it's a good way to discover music you may not have heard already. You're not able to choose a song but at least you can choose from artist and/or the types of music you enjoy."
"December 7, 2015","The app won't work on my kidle fire 7....so idk what to do but its really annoying Wish it worked but it just loads up and then the songs never start playing :😑"
"October 31, 2016","Music at your fingertips ! I have enjoyed the music and very few commercials . Thanks"
"July 15, 2016","I like Pandora... I just wish the free version allowed one to play ""greatest hits"" by an individual artist."
"March 14, 2016","Does not work 95% of the time on my Kindle fire. I have only gotten it to work twice for part of a song. Uninstalled. Works great on my phone ."
"January 18, 2016","Pandora delivers great quality music. I like being able to listen and rate tunes which in turn allows Pandora to better know what I will like in the future."
"June 19, 2016","Pandora was all i listened to until i reconnected my iPod, it sometimes gets disruptive but over all its a very good app!"
"March 22, 2016","Great station. Love the fact that you can set your station to a variety of music. Would recommend to anyone who love listening to great nusic"
"March 5, 2016","I love Pandora - such a mix of wonderful music that you can customize. Has many of my favorites and has introduced me to great new music as well."
"July 19, 2017","Love the choices of music, I listen to it at work."
"June 8, 2017","Great to listen to and I choose the ones I like ."
"April 29, 2017","Ya if u need a variety of music or comedy this is a good 👍👍app"
"November 11, 2014","love it and it keeps my dog and kitties company when I am not here!  I have had it for two years or so but just starting listening again. However, I wished there were just the albums for each individual-some artists end up on several lists."
"August 10, 2014","its a great app. u can skip the songs u don't want to listen to, but u can only skip so many. but u can listen to the station from ur favorite artist. and if u want to buy that song, it will take you straight to the site so u can buy it. it is totally awesome. I love it!"
"December 20, 2016","Great music. Wish I could afford the upgrade, enjoying commercial free radio."
"April 13, 2014","I absolutely love the Pandora radio app- I can always find the music I am in the mood for, and the channels I've created also bring me new artists that I might not have heard elsewise and I really enjoy that. I haven't upgraded to Pandora One but I don't find the ads to be too hard to deal with."
"March 16, 2017","💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖"
"May 15, 2017","I love Pandora it is a 10 in my book"
"July 2, 2017","Good item"
"February 3, 2016","If you are able to afford Pandora One it is worth it! Regular Pandora is frustrating to listen to with all the commercial interruptions..just my opinion"
"February 19, 2017","great"
"February 26, 2014","I enjoy having a diverse selection of artists and musicians at my fingertips! It's also an added bonus that you get to know new artists as well. If you love music, you'll love Pandora. They do repeat songs and the ads are annoying but it's the price you pay for free-you can always upgrade to Pandora One."
"July 18, 2017","It's a good app to use"
"July 24, 2013","I use pandora in the car, on my phone, on my Kindle while reading, on my PC while while writing, as well as through my TV when I'm not watching a program. I especially like the fact that I can select a group of entertainers and shuffle the music so I get a variety of styles and performers. Only rarely do I feel the need to skip a particular song."
"July 25, 2016","I can find all the songs I love. And have it on at work, home and in the car!! I'm a Pandora fanatic!!🎶👍🏻🎶!!"
"May 19, 2015","Great selection of genre and songs. I like the feature of mixing songs within all my genre."
"January 7, 2015","So awesome! I love that I can type in any song/artist/or movie that I'm thinking of and it will play similar songs. It usually takes forever to hear the particular song I was looking for. But I hear some other great ones along the way :)"
"October 7, 2015","I love this! I put in my favorite singers or genre and it plays a mixture of everything I love. Many choices. I set the timer for 30 or 60 minutes and doze off to my favorites."
"November 26, 2014","Love pandora. I love that I can easily make my own station and then by liking or disliking songs it will change the station a bit and learn to play what I like. Only problem so far is that with my stations there seems to be a lot of sons repeated."
"January 1, 2014","Pandora is a FREE music streaming app. Here are the Pros and Cons: Pros : Free music. Free account. You can sign into your account on any device . Cons : Takes WiFi. Cannot select individual songs to play. Cannot skip very many songs every hour. Hope this helped you ! :)"
"July 12, 2015","I love Pandora because I can choose stations of the genre I enjoy and stations of my favorite artists and then put on the shuffle or just listen to one station for a certain mood! Couldn't be better!"
"July 27, 2013","Pandora is a great app to have, especially for those who love music. If you wanna listen to a variety of music of a specific mood, but don't want to be bothered by making a playlist of some sort, Pandora can help you with that. Just type in a music title or some key words and Pandora will be churning out good songs that you'll like in no time."
"January 31, 2014","Super! Now I have a radio on my Kindle Fire HD. Pandora is a plethora of music choices. This app can be used as set as a alarm, set stations, no commercials, I love, love, love this app. I have no issues with it locking up. I haven't tried this app on my phone, that could be another matter but on my kindle it is to die for!"
"March 16, 2016","Pandora radio has changed a lot since I lasted used it years ago. I'm delighted with the new look and selection of specific genre and the variety."
"January 2, 2017","I only give it 2 stars because i jave to keep skiping until i get a good one."
"December 28, 2016","Super music! And lots of choices. I don't know how I ever managed without it."
"October 29, 2017","nice app"
"August 9, 2013","This is an OK app. I use it sometimes when working outside and sometimes when by myself. The reason I didn't give it a better rating is they seem to play the same songs over and over with the stations I have listened to. The Southern Gospel station will play the same songs again in a few hours, as well as other stations I have listened to."
"October 7, 2016","Great radio app love the fact i can make my own sound. Awesome for the gym or relaxing at home"
"September 2, 2016","I like Pandora because of the variety of music, voice or instrument which takes care of my atmosphere."
"July 8, 2016","I love Pandora, and have the app on my cell phone. I thought I may as well play it from my Kindle Fire tablet too."
"January 19, 2014","I loved Pandora radio before Pandora radio was cool!! when I first listened to Pandora my peers had not heard of it yet; now I don't know too many people that don't listen to it"
"September 1, 2017","Love Pandora, always."
"June 12, 2016","Love this app. I listen to Christian music and with Pandora I can pick my favorite artists - programming my own playlist."
"February 22, 2016","Thank you Wendy for providing us with this inspired,heartfelt and needed support for graceful transitioning with our beloved animal companions!!!!"
"June 28, 2016","this is a great app to listen to your favorite music. and new hits. I definetly recommend this app if you love music."
"December 11, 2013","I love Pandora and this is a very nice app. It allows you to access all of your channels and explore music intuitively. The only thing that I was not terribly fond of was the interface for creating new channels and finding music outside of your already defined channels. Otherwise it is a great app and very functional."
"December 13, 2016","recently I've begun playing cd's once more, pandora is now worse than am radio"
"June 15, 2016","The variety is cool but it's so confusing for me. Hopefully I'll get used to it cause it seems like a really cool thing."
"June 8, 2012","Exceeded expectation! Flawless install. Able to get any music channel taste. Brought back memories especially do wop! No negatives! Get it!"
"April 27, 2014","I have Pandora on our home computer, and now to have it ""to go"" on my Kindle is just fantastic! Love the huge selection of music I can pick from!  There is absolutely NOTHING bad to say about Pandora! Everyone should get this, start picking their music, and just ENJOY!!!"
"May 16, 2016","Fair, not very user friendly"
"June 20, 2017","Pandora is a great place for to listen to your favorite music."
"April 16, 2014","Pandora is grvat provided that you don't mind listenimg to attost otheer than the artost of youe choice most pd the time. I find it very frustrating. I recemtly added an srtist a,d lustened to WELL OVer100 songs on thi s station but SYILL have not heard even 1song by this artist. Thats just ridiculous."
"November 21, 2016","I really like Pandora. The only thing is I would like to have more skips available."
"January 14, 2017","It's O.K., but doesn't have near the catalog of different genres as Spotify."
"February 26, 2017","All processes of my purchase went as described in listing. I appreciate you."
"March 30, 2016","I love it, don't know what took me so long to download it, haven't stopped listening since it was downloaded, Love it! Love it! Love it!"
"August 21, 2017","Great music source. I am my own DJ"
"February 17, 2016","It's Pandora, was is there not to love? Works perfect. This never locks up or creates any issues for me. Pandora is a great app and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants a good free music app full of functionality like building your own ""taste"". This is one of the best mobile apps out there for music by a long shot."
"March 2, 2017","Love it"
"May 1, 2016","My problem with Pandora is, it don't always show the correct song and artist that is playing. I go to sleep listening every night!"
"September 18, 2013","This is the best thing since iTunes. I use Pandora quite a few hours a day. I also have it on my tablet. Everyone should join Pandora One. The fee for a year is so good and gives you want, what is so nice is that you can also load it on your cell phone and then play on your car radio.  I urge everyone to join and enjoy."
"July 1, 2013","I've used this website on my PC, and Phone and now on my Kindle. I'm now a Pandora One member. I love that it plays my favorite music and I can listen anywhere. Thank you Pandora !! I also found out that you can ""thumbs up or thumbs down"" a song and Pandora will learn what you like. How innovative. I listen to it on my Kindle and on my smart phone."
"March 16, 2015","It's ok. Music is good but often wont stream after commercials for several minutes. Also, some of the channels will play a genre of music unrelated to what you're listening to. But I haven't found anything I like better...."
"February 20, 2015","Used it on computers before. Downloaded it to kindlefire works great. You'll need a high speed internet connection. It was banned from my work computers because the employees where hogging the bandwidth with Pandora. Ads not bad"
"May 9, 2014","This app is fast, easy to use, and intuitive. The layout is very similar to that of the iOS version on the iPhone. My only issue is that when I'm out I'm more likely to have my phone on me so I use the app on my phone. When I'm at home I'm more likely to use Pandora on my computer because it's easier. So I very rarely seem to be able to find much use for Pandora on my Kindle. Additionally, my Kindle relies on wi-fi so when I'm out if I have no wi-fi access then the app is basically useless so I go back to my phone anyway. For me, personally, this app doesn't get much use on the Kindle."
"August 29, 2015","Love Pandora ...listen all the time. Like that you can pick the kind of music you like and that it will play music like it...found a bunch of new groups and artists I hadnt heard before."
"August 20, 2015","More and more commercials. Put on ambient music for my infant and the commercial came on and startled him because of how abruptly loud it was. How annoying. I used to love this application"
"November 25, 2014","The only negative thing, to me, about this app is that I don't get exactly what song I want, but I don't mind it! It makes think about new music! I love it so much! I would recommend this app to all people who love music and like to break molds!"
"October 10, 2012","I have a very eclectic mix on my station (I subscribe to PandoraOne, but the app is a free download); you can give a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" on any song, and, if you don't like it, will probably not hear anything too much like it again. I recently added another station for straight-ahead Latin jazz (e.g., Chucho Valdes, Dave Valentin, etc.), and the stuff they include is always very good."
"July 15, 2016","Great way to get a great mix of your music anywhere!"
"December 14, 2013","Love the new way you set it up Pandora. I did like the old version because it was so easy to pick the stations u wanted but this is pretty awesome the way u set it up and now I Can talk to my followers so thanks. And Pandora you have picked the best songs for my stations!  The Music Listener, Lillypop"
"October 31, 2017","I like it just wish it didn't have so many ads."
"May 30, 2017","I love the program they play, its wonderful the music i enjoy"
"November 6, 2016","too many commercials"
"April 28, 2016","App is fine but the latest update will not update/install. Have tried it many times and it just stays on install pending forever."
"January 11, 2017","Not a purchase, but an app that I use regularly. Thank you for the service."
"January 26, 2017","Love Pandora. I listen to Bluegrass gospel and it is hard to find on radio."
"January 3, 2017","Great app for music. Love the tunes. Wish there were less advertisements."
"June 13, 2016","I love listening to music from my favorite artists! I often discover music that I was unaware of! Pandora is AWESOME!!!"
"January 31, 2017","I'm a first time user of Pandora. I find it very user friendly. I like where your pick and it plays similar artists music."
"August 24, 2016","Love the fact I can listen to who ever I want. I love all kinds of music so I can make my own station."
"November 16, 2013","I like Pandora a lot, but it tends to shut down or freeze frequently. I does on my phone, iPad and computer. To be honest I am looking to replace it. I think the layout is awesome and they have a great concept but the ""bugs"" are annoying!"
"December 13, 2014","I play this all the time. Only downfall is after a while, songs will creep in that aren't even close to the genre selected. I made a Motley Crue station (gotta love the 80s hair metal), and after a couple hours, Bryan Adams played. WTF. LOL"
"January 17, 2014","I love being able to listen to music but the program is very difficult to understand how it works. There are not very clear instructions on how to get the type of music I like and put it all into a stream so I can listen. I don't want to have to have a tab for each song but rather a stream of constant music."
"November 23, 2014","Have used it at home for quite a while, now I use it with my Fire phone and Bluetooth to a Bose wireless speaker. Nice to have when doing my projects around the home-just pick what channel I'm in the mood for and let her play the tunes. . . ."
"April 11, 2013","I'm in love with this app! I've got it on my phone, my tablet, the laptop and the desktop!! I shuffle my playlist and that's all I need to do. I plan to cancel my Netflix subscription since I really don't use it as often as I've been using Pandora and subscribe to Pandora to get rid of the commercials ( they're not bad but I just prefer to be commercial free)"
"October 31, 2013","Pandora has been around a long time so by now everyone pretty much knows what they're getting. I have been using the free version for about two years now, listening to the endless cycling of the same commercials every 2-3 songs - but hey it's free so I can't dispute it otherwise. The commercials are relatively short but it wouldn't hurt to mix them up every once in a while rather than force the listener to hear to the same Home Depot bit a dozen times within the span of two hours. I have yet to purchase Pandora One (paid version), but the thought has crossed my mind since it's only a measly $3 per month ($36/year). This version eliminates all commercials.  Pros: -free -offers different stations from an array of artists where alike music is mixed in -there is enough variety if you like to frequently switch stations -easily syncs with your phone allowing for a skip or pause button -they have a decent rating system where it plays to your likes and dislikes -if you get tired of a song then there are options to shelf it for a while  Cons: -commercials are repetitive and seems to have become more frequent than what they were two years ago when I first downloaded -not enough variety of songs if you keep it on one station, you hear the same tracks if you're a daily listener -rating system tends to overcompensate to your like and dislikes (e.g. if you give a thumbs up to say a country song that you're listening to, then they will force feed you with country songs thinking that's all you want to hear), but the more you rate the better it fixes itself  Overall Recommendation: If commercials bother you then one can eliminate commercials by subscribing at a monthly cost less than what it takes to put a gallon of gas in your car. I would definitely pay the $3 if there was a guarantee for better variety, but until then I'm satisfied with the free version and who knows, maybe that's why I'm shopping at Home Depot more as of late..."
"December 20, 2016","Love Pandora. Wish that you could skip more songs when you want to though."
"April 29, 2015","I love jamming out to music, and I can choose who I listen to. No matter what my mood, Pandora has me covered."
"May 31, 2016","It's really good!You get the listen to music for free!The only think I don't like about it is...that is messes up a lot.."
"June 14, 2017","Graet"
"March 29, 2016","I listen to Pandora more than other music programs I have, It is user friendly and works very well. I would recommend it to everyone!!!"
"March 29, 2016","I love Pandora because I can listen to McKameys Radio all the time and not have to listen to something that isn't true southern gospel."
"December 29, 2012","Maybe I'm being too generous. I've had no experience with this app on other platforms, so I can't make comparisons. I just know iWork's as advertised, much better clarity than normal radio, and less commercials. I think the options for creating your own stations are great, and I've been introduced to new music that fits my selected genre that I never would have found on my own."
"August 7, 2015","I got this app and it works great, but once I get on the app I have to wait 10 min for it to load!! I would recommend spotify, because you can litsen to music you actually search for, and Pandora when I search for a song the real song does not come on it is a completely different song then what I search for therfor GET SPOTIFY"
"October 1, 2014","I enjoy listening while I work on my desktop PC, and also on my Kindle. I can create stations tailored to my likes and easily switch from station to station or skip a selection. The thumbs-up/thumbs-down feature enhances music choices. I'm enjoying it!"
"December 1, 2016","Very interesting. I have only started using it. It has great potential though."
"July 20, 2016","My stations are hardly loading anymore since I got a new phone.... And that's with a strong Wi-Fi signal"
"June 28, 2015","i enjoy streaming music on pandora, i usually get surprised by a song i haven't heard or a song i like but have not listened to for awhile, the songs i don't care to hear i just give the thumbs down"
"March 18, 2016","Likely all genres of music Pandora as well as IHeartRadio fills my craving for music from Classical to Country to jazz and even Big Band."
"April 16, 2016","It has all my favorite fnaf songs and every other songs are on it to!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👦👦👦👦👦👦👦👦👦👦👦👦👦😸😸😸😸😸😸😸😸😸😸"
"July 14, 2016","Who doesn't live Pandora? Now it's on your Kindle. Just choose your station and listen. That's it, that easy"
"October 1, 2017","I love listening to Pandora, especially Tony Bennett radio."
"August 30, 2017","To many commercials on Pandora......LOVE Amazon Music..👍🏼"
"August 21, 2017","Find all the music I like at my finger tips!!"
"September 7, 2017","Love the easy access to the music you want to hear, anytime and anyplace!"
"September 21, 2015","Tons of commercials now and they play the same songs over and over. Must be saving in having to pay royalties. I've heard Spotify is much better and I would pay for that service."
"March 25, 2014","you program your station with the music you want and some suggestions from Pandora. they have a larges selection of music and comedy to choose from. you just have to watch how much you use this app because after so many hours a month you have to pay for it, but it is free up til that amount."
"August 20, 2013","A very sophisticated way to listen to music. We can choose a style, a composer or a singer and listen at our own leisure. We can even assign thumbs up or down to the songs we want to listen more or less often. I loved the possibility to read the lyrics of each song or information about the singer, performer or composer. This is a must!"
"September 25, 2015","This service was recommended by an employee at Radio Shack. I was searching for smooth jazz for my hospitalized sister. I loaded Pandora Media on my Kindle, and the service offered the smooth jazz genre, Just what I needed. I would recommend this service to anyone that enjoys music on the go, or at home. It is free, and the adds can be eliminated for a small amount each month. I do appreciate the tip from the Radio Shack employee. Much appreciated."
"November 12, 2016","Enjoy Pandora"
"February 27, 2016","This app has transformed my old Kindle Fire into a device that I still use. I love listening to Pandora on it! Who doesn't love free music?"
"December 6, 2016","Way too many commercials and the stations will only play your artist, rarely"
"August 14, 2014","A co-worker told me about Pandora and that I pick the style of music. Because I like many different styles I choose several. When I play the music I choose shuffle and just listen to the music. I will not hesitate recommending to anyone. Thanks for the free music."
"December 4, 2014","I Myself have not yet really used this app. But I must tell You that My Husband LOVES IT!! He is often Stuck in the Wonderful LA  Traffic every am and pm while traveling to and from work. So for that reason I Must give it 5 Stars!"
"August 23, 2013","I was hesitant at first before buying the app, but I fell in love with Pandora. I have come across artists I have never listened to and really liked what I heard. Only thing I would change is the amount of skips I am allowed. I think if I pay for it, I should be able to skip songs whenever I want. Overall I love love love this app!!!!"
"May 5, 2014","I toats love this app!!!!!!!! I use this all the time to listen to the latest pop music for free. All you do is look up a singer or song. Then, you pick a station. Then music will start playing and if you don't like the song, you can skip it. Toast love it!!!!!!&#60;3 :)"
"May 8, 2016","I use to love Pandora, I still use it but, THE ADS with a free account are getting ridiculous! Download Spotify, it's better."
"July 11, 2015","so cool you get to pick your own stations and pick your own music. Plus it's free and you can turn it on anytime you want. It helps when your cleaning or when you wanna waste time and just sing."
"July 28, 2016","I really miss Songza so was on the hunt for a new app to play music. Found Pandora, tried it, and love it."
"April 20, 2016","I enjoy the audio book, it a great read. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to grow from the inside - out."
"January 9, 2013","What I love about Pandora is being exposed to artists and genres that heretofore I was not aware of, then being inspired to buy artists' recordings. No commercials, just good, solid music. Interested in Brazilian? Zydeco? Salsa? Top 40? Sinatra and the Rat Pack? Karmin and more? Even little-known artists are on here (Lee PressOn and the Nails for one). Give your ear a treat!"
"October 6, 2017","Listen to it all day"
"August 29, 2017","Love listening to all my favorite songs on pandora 😀"
"June 14, 2017","Good would be better without any commercials"
"November 21, 2015","I love to hear my favorite music and relax. It work perfectly in my Fire phone love that every one can hear me sing. They now that I'm happy. I recommend this app."
"May 31, 2016","It will have a great playlist at first and then it will turn into a radio station with all of the ""newest hits"""
"November 20, 2015","I personally love Pandora but with the new update it freezes up every few songs or doesn't play at all. I will keep this bad reveiw up until my old friend is back."
"June 20, 2014","It is easy to set up my own style of music; I like many types of music. Pandora has lots and lots of variety. The sound is excellent and is easy to login I am very pleased with Pandora."
"August 16, 2015","It didn't load automatically to my Kindle like I thought it would. I've spent over 2 hours trying to get it to work, including watching youtube videos and still can't get it on my apps."
"March 2, 2016","why are a lot of songs cut off short,if all of the songs played all the way thru I would give it 5 stares I love it except for that problem"
"January 16, 2014","It is everything it is advertised to be, free listening pleasure, with ads popping up fairly continuously before and after tracks. I love it and will probably switch to 'ad free' some day. For now it serves its purpose, great workout music and the best music the genre has to offer is offered on Pandora."
"June 21, 2014","I love this app! I have all my different stations set up, and use Pandora on my computer, cell phone and Kindle! I do subscribe to it, so don't worry about ads and stopping my programs. Well worth the price, which is minimal. Who needs radio when you can have Pandora?!!"
"June 24, 2013","Plays pretty well. BUt there have been several songs /artists that are far from unknown that I thought surely would be included and were not showing up at all in search! This needs improving, also on the FREE version, there seems a lot of stopping, and pausing between playing tracks. BUt hey, it is FREE so am not really complaining. Haha!! ;o)"
"October 31, 2016","lots of advertisement and only plays a few songs of the artist's radio you choose.."
"August 4, 2013","This is probably the best music app available today. I can listen to all my favorite stations including artists such as Lindsey Stirling, Ellie Goulding, The Script, OneRepublic, and Carrie Underwood. You can even browse genre stations too! I listen it practically every day and I always find great new songs! I highly recommend this app!"
"May 21, 2013","I love Pandora because of the ease of use and because I can quickly create and customize my radio stations.  I did not rate Pandora a five simply because one must suscribe to the paid service for unlimited listening. That said, I will probably upgrade to the paid service anyway, because it is really a nominal cost for such a great service."
"July 14, 2016","The music never stops!Love that I can pick my favourite song and they play songs in the same genre! Awesome!"
"August 14, 2017","Pandora is the most awesome creation anyone could design."
"July 18, 2017","It gets to know what you like and plays songs accordingly"
"June 18, 2017","It never let me sign in on my kindle fire😑"
"September 30, 2017","I love hearing only the songs I really love"
"July 25, 2017","Its alright too bad for all the commercial."
"July 31, 2016","Previewing free Pandora before purchasing the one without commercials. Appears to work well on my Echo."
"January 15, 2017","I like that it will play Similar music to the artist you have selected."
"February 6, 2017","Grat addition to my android phone. I can stream music in my classic car"
"January 24, 2017","Its great for when I want something new that I dont have on my playlist"
"September 1, 2017","I enjoy listening to pandora."
"October 21, 2015","love being able to have music on the go. I only wish they did not up the cost to have the add free version but I still love the app and being able to choose my stations."
"January 2, 2014","I like listening to the music on my computer at work and at home on my ipad and Pandora is a great way to do this. My only complaint is some of the choice of music selections it picks for me to listen to I don't care for and run out of skips or thumbs down and get stuck listening to songs I don't care for."
"February 27, 2016","Pandora is a great place that has the music I listen to. You can have a lot of stations and it's is organized and a great music app to use."
"August 19, 2016","Pandora is amazing. You just choose what you're interested in and boom. Channel. I found like 30 new songs that I love in just like 3 days. I also like it because you can open up another app while playing music."
"November 6, 2013","I don't know if it is this version of Pandora or my Kindle that makes this app take so long to load. I have a solid connection, but it can take five to ten minutes for this to begin playing. I also cannot find any way to close it without turning my Kindle off. I love Pandora on my iBook, but this version on my Kindle."
"April 28, 2017","I LOVE Pandora!"
"October 22, 2017","Great selection"
"November 21, 2013","I have loved Pandora for years, and I was so excited that I could have it on my tablet. All my account presets were there and it's nice to take my music with me without constantly having to change out my iPod playlists when I change my mind. I think I'd forgotten how good it was to just listen to a radio station.."
"April 8, 2017","This app helps me when I'm at the gym😁😁😁😁😁"
"June 19, 2014","I created a channel I titled ""Eagles Radio"", feeling like listening to some mellow, classic rock one day. I have yet to have them play a single Eagles tune since I told them what I prefer. They DO play a lot of ""B sides"" by groups I wasn't all that fond of."
"June 18, 2016","I love the music choices on this app, and you can create whatever station of music you want to hear. I love it!!!"
"October 9, 2013","Love having access to my music were ever I am or go on all my devices without having to sit for an hour uploading and then downloading to which ever devices that I'm using at the time. Big red truck dump truck, if you don't have Pandora know that I do and I'm not with out my sound. Here's your sign and join the membership."
"June 29, 2017","It is good but would like to search songs."
"August 4, 2017","Just wish they didn't have to have the ads"
"January 13, 2017","I HATE Pandora- too many stupid ads!! I will never use this app again!"
"August 9, 2014","I love this app!! You can't beat free music anywhere!!! I love how you can play music while playing any other app!! You can have any station and the update is so much better!!! I totally recommend it... GET IT!! 100% AWESOME!! I am 11 years old and love it!!! :)"
"September 16, 2016","Another music source.....primarily use it on my pad. Also have it via my satellite service."
"June 8, 2017","My radio of choice for years"
"January 9, 2015","the features and the platform of pandora are pretty good. but the songs that are played can become very repetitive. I think this can be fixed by playing more than just the hits. I think there are plenty of other songs on albums that never get played which could add a lot more variety."
"March 7, 2016","I listen to all types of music and Pandora allows me to explore each avenue of my various favorites on any occasion. Gotta love Pandora!"
"December 7, 2013","I love Pandora it is AWESOME!!! I love it because you can say if you like it or not and then it doesn't play that song agian if you don't like it!!! I got this app because my friend told me it was great for when your doing chores or whatever! But on my kindle it sometimes takes a LITTLE bit to load!!!! =) <3"
"April 25, 2013","I down load this station to all of my pc's and tablets too. Not that I have that many. But for free, you can't go wrong. The only down fall is that sense they upgraded it I can't or don't know how to get to the part where you create your own stations. Or create new ones or add stuff. Other than that I love it it is the best. Marilyn from Remus, Michigan"
"January 5, 2015","Could not log onto Pandora. Trying to register, it said there was already an account with my email. So, trying to log in using my email and password, they said there was no such account. Catch-22. I guess I won't be using Pandora."
"December 16, 2013","I uploaded Pandora on my kindle because my power went out and I hate a quiet house. I love Pandora because I get to listen to only the music I like to hear. I enjoy music all day as I work and would encourage anyone who loves to listen to the music they like and not a lot of songs they don't to get Pandora."
"June 20, 2016","That I could only skip a few songs before I was forced to listen to music I didn't like or wasn't interested in."
"February 18, 2015","Oh, Yeah! This is my favorite. Works the best, picks new songs that I will like, and has a timer so I can play if for 30 minutes as I fall asleep, Every Night! I can't say I use any other app every day like I use this one."
"January 18, 2016","I have been a member of Pandora since they started. many years ago.Easy to set-up and use. I love that it chooses songs based on my taste in music."
"May 31, 2017","I absolutely love Pandora! I can't wait till I can pick just the artist n not the groups. I want to be able to pick songs one day!"
"August 27, 2017","Awesome!!!!!!!"
"August 11, 2017","Cannot be beat"
"September 3, 2017","Like the music"
"November 22, 2015","Disappointed because I haven't been able to listen to any songs yet on this app. Not sure if I am doing something wrong. Would appreciate some feedback on this"
"August 2, 2014","Excellent app!!"
"December 18, 2016","I love being able to pick the types of music 🎶 I love ❤️ by the artist I like"
"May 15, 2016","I like the way they can mix decades music.I enjoy picking different kinds of music genres. The music can pick up my day."
"August 21, 2017","I like how it work in my car & it has ever song I want."
"January 22, 2014","I resisted paying for Pandora One for several years. I enjoyed the service, but I couldn't bring myself to pay the price. Once I did, I kicked myself for waiting so long. It is so nice to just have wall to wall music. I love it. On my phone, tablet, TV, home unit. all for one price. It is great."
"October 6, 2017","Love Pandora - has all my favorite music."
"April 30, 2017","Wonderful to have and ... it's free !!!!!"
"November 12, 2015","Whenever I pause music and start it, my voice input toggles on my Fire phone. It gets annoying because I have to restart my Pandora just to listen to music again."
"February 2, 2017","If you love classic rock like I do then you need to download Pandora."
"December 20, 2016","It's great. You can listen to what you want and change when you want."
"January 5, 2017","if i could give 0 stars. i would . i could not get it to work at all."
"September 3, 2016","Takes me to another level of consciousness at the change of a Genre or a request of an artiat."
"October 13, 2014","I don't like that it doesn't let you skip more than one or two songs in an hour of listening. considering that you're not getting ONLY the artist whose music you selected, they should let you pass on more of the ""selections"" they feature."
"September 28, 2017","Didn't work while traveling"
"April 29, 2014","I enjoy many different styles and genres of music and Pandora will play songs from all of them and mix it up any way I want them to. I love the control and also the 'suggested' artists that fit into my chosen artist genres. I only wish I could have Pandora on my car radio as well!"
"May 26, 2016","I love Pandora. Not only do I get to choose music/artists I like but Pandora suggests others that expand my horizons."
"July 14, 2014","I think it's a great app. It's all you would want but I personally would like more thumb downs available . But if you are looking for an app to personalize your own stations and optional privacy it's great. Check it's so good I'm listening to it while I'm typing!!!!"
"November 25, 2013","Not much to say. Its a music service. That gives me exactly what I want to hear and listens to me when i tell it I don't like something and would rather not hear it again. I plug it in at work and set my stations and rock out in the kitchen all day. It's great. Great enough that I decided to pay for it. :)"
"April 5, 2014","i downloaded this to my asus from windows and had issues with it. Downloaded it to my kindle fire first. Turns out, it's not a verified app from pandora. it violates pandora's terms of use to use this app."
"August 11, 2016","Love Pandora! Love how it basically mskes a radio station around your likes and dislikes of music."
"January 27, 2016","Excellent Music Provider...like the format and ease of use...I prefer to ""shuffle"" my selections...endless variety throughout the day..."
"February 27, 2015","I listen to my favorite stations. I have a wide variety of tastes for music. I like country, pop, Christmas, 90s, 80s, Christian, Irish, every holiday music, and more. I don't have a set station so I listen to them all."
"August 10, 2015","This app would be great if I didn't use so much WiFi services l just to use the app and listen to music. I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have to use so much service to.play it...."
"August 20, 2017","two thumbs up"
"February 12, 2014","This is a good site, depending on whose hands it is in. There are so many genres of music available, that everybody should be happy. I don't mind it for myself at all, but my kids were listening to things I didn't want them to listen to. I had to delete it for the present time until they can make better choices."
"April 13, 2015","This is the best thing we ever found. My mom loves music and at ninety years old I am always trying to find something for her. This hit the nail on the head and when I can get it away from her I get to listen."
"January 21, 2015","Pandora entertains 24 hours a day with a great variety of programing, superb quality and no steenkin' commercials. I often listen to Pandora on my Kindle Fire; it's great to have Pandora with me where ever I am. Very pleased."
"May 2, 2016","You can find almost anything on this app,the only reason I didn't give it 5stars is because you can only skip a few songs."
"May 15, 2016","Randomly stops my music...it's getting annoying. I have to restart the app and of course it starts on a different song."
"February 20, 2015","I much prefer the advertisements to the limited listening times that Pandora used to have. I LOVE the shuffle feature allowing multiple stations to be mixed. Only feature missing is the ability to merge similar stations."
"April 20, 2014","I'll say it again, Best online radio ever. I like the fact that I can change the type of music I like to hear to suet my mood. I have it on my Kindle Fire. The sound is fantastic. Plus I can listen to Pandora while I read or play certain games. It's great. Thank You. Billy Billing."
"February 2, 2016","Only plays 1 song at a time then freezes up on my Kindle Fire. Closing the app doesn't get it to work, have to restart then still plays1 song."
"August 21, 2017","Listen to Southern gospel while cooking."
"September 27, 2017","Great music of your choice at anytime !!"
"September 21, 2016","I love being able to create my own station so I always have ""my"" music available."
"January 25, 2017","Hooked up so can use outside by pool. Get sound thru our Kindle too!"
"December 20, 2016","Music, music and more music, the only thing is the commericals...ads"
"January 9, 2017","I really like Pandora because it listens to your likes and dislikes."
"August 24, 2017","I got the upgrade was charged for it and still got are you listening"
"August 21, 2016","With a click on Pandora app it down loaded and I was listening to all my favorite music. 5 stars"
"December 30, 2016","Great stations. Which I knew about it sooner"
"April 28, 2017","I have always love Pandora"
"December 27, 2015","Does not work on Amazon fire tablet"
"February 23, 2014","If you love music like me. You are going to LOVE this app all the music you can think of you don't even have to pay I introduced this app to about 80 people they love it to I put on a classical station and put my head phones in and I fall asleep I recommend you get this app if you are like me"
"August 11, 2014","Let's keep in mind this took FOREVER to come out. So, the time it was being established doesn't meet the all the bugs. This is most likely the result of the foreign makes of the kindle not u understanding a word of English. This is why we have been forgotten."
"December 30, 2014","The only reason I didn't rate it a full five stars, is because I have only been using Pandora for a short time and honestly have not yet had an opportunity to fully explore what it has to offer. But who can complain, IT'S FREE!!!"
"October 23, 2016","I find it difficult to maneuver. I have not yet found a way to stop the program."
"November 19, 2016","It a good music app but I don't like how you have a limited amour if skips."
"March 4, 2014","Pandora is incredible! The Kindle App is easy to use. In all honesty, I cannot believe how easy it is to listen to the music I love ALL the time, from big band to the Rat Pack to classic Rock. I use a nice bluetooth speaker and it sounds like I've got the actual bands/singers in my condo!"
"February 27, 2014","I had a very hard time getting this to work for my Kindle Fire. I deleted it and went to Songza. I love it. I have used it in the past, but I just believe Songza offers a different and better listening experience."
"August 27, 2016","Still learning how to operate. I am sure my grandsons would get it in a Snap! Very enjoyable."
"February 15, 2014","Good music and much better selection than XMRadio. The only draw back is the frequency that the music stops. It is much better with a subscription as there are no commercials however it still stops playing way too often requiring restarting or notification that ""I am still listening""."
"February 20, 2015","I credit my genre of music range to Pandora. Absolute genius. Users complain about limited skips and I see it as a benefit - sometimes you have to listen to the whole song to relate to it. I will forever follow Pandora."
"April 10, 2015","It's user-friendly. And just the best thing ever. My stations are the most diverse collection of artists you can imagine. But they're all my favorites. I bought a small speaker system so I can plug my phone in and play Pandora anywhere with great sound. This has become a deeply appreciated part of my life."
"June 27, 2016","Genre based Stations that listener has setup play unrelated songs. Should be no skip limit if there are ads."
"March 21, 2016","Love the app, mine stopped working after a recent update. I deleted the old app reinstalled and now it is stable and working great"
"June 19, 2017","I am very happy with the music choices and selection."
"December 8, 2015","Great music app! :) lots of choices of different genres. You can choose what stations you like. They have very great song choices. Love love this app! :)"
"September 11, 2014","My granddaughter asked if I listened to Pandora. I told her ""no"" as I didn't really know how to download it on my Kindle. She offered to teach me how to download my favorite artists and the rest was so easy. I am now enjoying all the ""Golden Oldies"" I missed so much. Now I can whistle while I work or sing along with Bing. I just love it!"
"April 18, 2014","This app is amazing!  I can listen to all of my favorite groups, and it takes up about 7 percent storage!  It took 22 seconds to download, and I have over 600 pictures and 90 apps."
"January 28, 2017","Pandora allows me to choose music I love, enjoy, and fits my needs."
"December 27, 2016","Pandora is just flat out awesome. Easy to use and fun to listen to."
"March 29, 2016","Pandora rules you can choose the songs you like and get rid of ones you don't its a awesome way to listen to your favorite tunes"
"August 31, 2014","Don't know how anyone could not love Pandora The variety of music is almost hard to fathom. One of my very favorite apps. The little bit advertising is not intrusive and a real bargain for this wonderful app. Thank everyone involved with this app"
"February 1, 2016","Download was quick and painless. The app itself has too many commercials, but it definitely beats the regular DJ yammering on most stations."
"January 14, 2014","I have just started to use Pandora and like the fact that you can pick the artist, or type of music you like. You can't pick an individual song but that didn't matter to me. You can give a song a like and Pandora will find more of the same of dislike. I can play it on my pc or my kindle fire hd."
"May 30, 2015","I've had Pandora for a long time but didn't know how to work it. My girl friends daughter helped me and now I have lots and lots of good music. Boy, was I missing out. Thanks Pandora, I love it."
"July 4, 2016","It's an ok app. I like Pandora, but sometimes this app won't work on my phone. It just gets stuck loading."
"October 25, 2014","Not worth the money! You spend too much time selecting/deselecting tunes that you either like/dislike! Time-consuming. The programming does not follow the music interest I select. However, you may find it a better buy, I certainly didn't!"
"July 16, 2013","I can create my own stations Listen to theirs Add Artists to stations or do thumbs down and not here that artist again The ""New Age DJ""--ME.. You can mix it up or listen to only one Genre or artist.. Anyone who gets tired of hearing the same songs on the radio Make your own station be your own DJ!"
"June 24, 2013","LOVE this app!!! Listen to your kind of music anytime you want for free. You make your own stations and Pandora selects songs from artists who are similar to what you have selected. You can 'like' or 'unlike' each song to build your library or just listen to what Pandora chooses for you. I don't listen to anything but Pandora anymore!"
"July 15, 2013","I love the app for pandora. Anywhere you go you can jam out to your favorite tunes! Requires 3g or 4g or internet to play but still it wotks great. Its just like the web based version but portable. I wish they didnt have commercials but you gotta pay for that . Other than that its angreat app.and i recommend it to anyone and everyone."
"April 29, 2016","Downloaded app, attempted to sign up, and denied. Quite simply a phishing app that asked for too much info. Deleting now."
"July 6, 2017","My Favorite"
"May 4, 2017","Easy to use"
"March 11, 2017","Its musical"
"October 31, 2016","I'm New to the music apps. Not able to compare. Like it so far. Still learning"
"April 12, 2015","Too many commercials . Annoying to listen to all the commercials. I thought I'd be able to listen to music without commercials. or maybe even just one or two. but there were so many that it made it horrible."
"January 23, 2014","Great app. Have not had any problems with it. Very clear sound from my kindle fire HDX. I love the landscape and portrait feature."
"May 9, 2015","This is a great app. The only problem is after the new update the sleep timer is hidden in the settings. Where as before you just swiped from the right to access it. The new location is kind of a pain."
"April 27, 2016","Great listening to songs that come to mind and then many more songs from same time period creating a musical fulfilment ."
"July 18, 2017","Pandora is pretty good! Stops some,and s to restart."
"October 17, 2017","It's has all kind of music. I love it."
"December 31, 2016","They barrage you with adds all the time to buy the no ads version."
"August 24, 2017","Love the custom stations"
"May 31, 2017","I. Love. This. So. Much"
"December 2, 2016","Great music! Set up stations and get even morw than you bargined for!"
"September 19, 2016","Love love love Pandora. Great stations tons to chose from can't go wrong with this app."
"January 26, 2016","Love my new Kindle Fire 8 and love listening to Pandora radio through it. I now have a small portable stereo that I take everywhere with me."
"September 1, 2016","I love Pandora! especially the newer features of it being an alarm and sleep timer as well!"
"August 25, 2017","Greart app"
"January 25, 2016","I love Pandora and the variety of music they play for me. I get to learn about musicians that I have never heard of before but end up loving."
"February 3, 2016","Easy to install, great variety in music selection. I've added it to my mobile devices as well. Not sure what took me so long to get Pandora"
"February 16, 2016","No option to cancel the boot on start up, which means it will always be running until I manually close it every time. Will not be using."
"July 5, 2016","I love Pandora. It thumbnails songs and picks out good song choices. Variety of stations is very good."
"March 1, 2017","It never loads on a kindle fire!!!!!!"
"December 18, 2013","It's great for phones (like android) and kindle ( and Apple iPods/iPads). I'd prefer spotify better but it only lets you have a trial for 2 days unless you buy premium and haha no I don't want to buy your premium carp at least pandora is cool like that and has just adds not trials pandora thank you<3"
"January 18, 2017","Good choices and selections from all ranges if music people like."
"January 5, 2017","I love Pandora♥️, it is the best, you can find a variety of music"
"January 16, 2017","Works as expected does a good job with a large selection of music"
"February 18, 2017","PLESE WITH TH PRODUCT ONLY ISSUE IS FINDING MORE TIME TO ENJOY IT"
"January 1, 2017","I enjoy creating my own radio stations, all my favorite artists."
"January 7, 2013","I've been with Pandora for years. I gladly give it five stars because it is my favorite music app. I would have given it five stars years ago and they keep getting better. I've tried Spotify, Songza, Last.FM, I Heart Radio and only Songza comes close.  I've always liked the way Pandora works out what I like using a system they call the ""Music Genome Project"" [...]"
"May 30, 2017","Did not order this!!!!!"
"January 16, 2013","I got a new Kindle and quickly started downloading a bunch of apps and books. I downloaded this app and use it daily to see what’s going on in the world. I love this app. It works!"
"July 17, 2016","Everybody know Pandora, is really very nice to have playlists with all the music we like and is free."
"April 26, 2014","I have only had a smart phone for about 8 months but Pandora is one of my favorite things about it. It is easy to work and select my type of music. I can put my blue tooth in and go for hours with Pandora playing. I recommend it to all my friends telling them it is the best."
"March 3, 2014","I travel a lot and with my computer/iphone I can listen to radio all the time no matter where I may be. I can listen to my favorite music all bundles up in one station. The beauty is that I can change my genre anytime I want and listen to whatever my listening pleasure is at the moment."
"September 5, 2013","Since Pandora is free over the internet and wi-fi, I assumed, wrongly, that it would be free on my tablet. The app works fine, but know in advance that Pandora will charge you a fee to listen on your Kindle. I will try to connect using my internet connection to see if I can listen for free that way and will let you know."
"June 29, 2016","I love the music I can select WHEN IT WORKS!!!! All too often it starts and after a song or two it quits!"
"October 26, 2012","I have used pandora for a long time and absolutely LOVE IT! I can put in a band name and Pandora will pick the same Genre to play. I find a lot of new music that I love while listening to Pandora that I normally wouldn't hear on the radio station I listen to. It also lets me read a bands biography while listening to them play so that I know more about the people in the group."
"December 14, 2014","I have several station on Pandora now and enjoy sharing lists with my friends. Their suggestions can go off my style pretty quick if I'm out of the room for 10-15 minutes, but for the most part they stick close to my preferences."
"July 9, 2015","Pandora One is an excellent source of high quality music. The only drawback is the 100 station cap and for some of us audiophiles that is just a very slight inconvenience, very slight..."
"April 7, 2015","I did NOT either order or review Pandora!!! This thing put itself on my phone without my permission, so my review is: remove this app!!! I don't even know what it does. It has no business installing itself."
"March 13, 2016","Love Pandora. The ads are getting longer and longer. Seems like they're increasingly trying to force you to purchase the upgrade."
"July 27, 2013","Easy to set up a station by genre with the option to skip a song if it's is not what you expected. Or pick an artist and Pandora will find all the albums and shuffle them for you. It's a bit like i-tunes on an i-pad... but much more powerful. At this moment, I'm listening to 'Film Scores Radio' on my Kindle Fire. It's great."
"January 19, 2014","I love this because it plays music non-stop even if you turn it off and it plays all of these different stations. I would recommend this to people how like music. (But everyone knows of Pandora so pandora is on a role.)by everyone I mean friend z and family. So that is what I think about Pandora."
"March 13, 2016","This app is awesome. It downloaded really fast and it is free. You can select any type of music and genre. May God Bless You All."
"July 31, 2016","music for any mood or occasion. And you get to mix it up if you want too. I totally love Pandora."
"May 11, 2017","Pandora keeps me sane at work. Thank you Pandora!"
"March 10, 2017","I listen too the station allthe time sndi love it."
"July 21, 2017","Tried Google play came back to Pandora and never looked back"
"August 30, 2017","Not what I expected at all. Might as well go back to a boom box."
"August 23, 2017","Would be a 5 but you still have to pay to get commercial free..."
"December 26, 2016","I love the easy access to the site and the clear speaker quality"
"February 10, 2017","Both my wife and myself cherish our Pandora .... cant much more."
"June 21, 2016","Awesome. I downloaded this because I am getting an Echo and want to be able to listen to different music."
"July 17, 2016","Love the flexibility of this music app, if it was 100% reliable it would have gotten the fifth star!"
"July 17, 2016","This is a great app. Whatever artist, or genre that I choose, it provides a nice selection of music."
"June 29, 2017","I use it every morning"
"May 8, 2016","It's a great app and I like using it when I am looking for a certain type of music, I can always find it on Pandora."
"December 14, 2016","Constant advertisements while using app--Annoying to the extreme."
"November 8, 2015","Excellent Service! No complaints!"

"October 27, 2016","Love it,just wish I could chose a song that I wanna listen to at the moment."
"September 1, 2017","Like it."
"November 27, 2012","I was an early adopter of Pandora. I was very happy to see the app come to Android; to discover that my channels and preferences were maintained on my tablet just made things even better. This and Spotify are my two current music apps - Spotify for when I want to find a specific song, and Pandora for when I just want to listen to songs that I like, and to be surprised."
"January 28, 2014","We live in a very remote area and have access to only a few radio stations. With Pandora, we can listen to any type of music we sign up and without interruptions from ads....We LOVE Pandora! IT is easy to navigate and typing in the type of artists we love to listen to is easy and convenient."
"September 25, 2015","I've enjoyed Pandora thus far it's everything I thought it would be. I get to pick my choices in music that's very important with these watered down stations now days!"
"August 8, 2015","Pandora is a great app because of it playing a variety of songs relating to the artist, genre, or song you write. But sometimes I just want to only hear all of one artists songs."
"March 30, 2016","Michael Connelly is a great mystery writer. I am sure he could rewrite the telephone directory and it would be fascinating."
"November 3, 2015","I don't own my own music library or like to take responsibility for the music I make my friends listen too. Pandora is perfect for my music starved lifestyle."
"February 10, 2015","I really enjoy the variety of music that I can listen to on Pandora but I'm disappointed that while I'm listening to it, it stops playing. Then I have to open the app again and start all over. Please fix the glitch."
"September 12, 2016","I like the oldies best. When I hear a song I like I can see who is singing the words."
"July 17, 2014","Slacker Radio is Much Better than Pandora. Songza is even better than Slacker."
"April 29, 2017","I love Pandora! Take it everywhere."
"May 2, 2017","I can't get it to play on my Kindle"
"July 31, 2016","I have the ad-free service so my music choice is uninterrupted. Pandora is a constant companion."
"January 28, 2016","I love Pandora. The only issue I have is that I downloaded this on my Kindle, and every time the screen goes dark (idles from not being used), the music stops and I have to open the screen again."
"December 29, 2016","I don't use it. I can find the music I like with my local radio"
"January 9, 2017","Good for streaming music, just wish there were less commercials"
"December 26, 2016","Love it. I've listened to it for years and plan to continue to."
"July 17, 2016","I have had Pandora on my Android for years. It is now synchronized with my Kindles. Enjoy it a lot."
"January 1, 2016","I have subscribed to Pandora for 5 years. I enjoy good Christian music with a large selection of artist. There is.none better than Pandora 24-7."
"August 28, 2015","I just installed this on my BlackBerry Z10 and the commercials all play fine but not one song will play. I can see the album art but there's no movement of the music slider"
"August 6, 2014","Great..."
"January 17, 2015","Love, love, love my Pandora."
"May 29, 2013","Connect from home fine. Connect from work 1 mile away hangs. Login screen doesn't remember your user name and password, Slacker remembers but is repeat repeat repeat on the music. I regret having purchased the Pandora One upgrade, only to have it not work while I'm driving to work. Slacker connects in two seconds, side by side comparison."
"February 4, 2016","A neighbor at a beach campsite introduced me to Pandora., I will be forever grateful.  GREAT ENTERTAINMENT AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT !"
"February 3, 2014","This app has many channels to choose from and had never failed me in what im looking to listen to. If i choose an artist it plays artists like it if i choose a song it chooses songs in the same range of feeling im wanting to hear! Its great and i recoommend everyone to have a pandora account"
"January 27, 2016","Bought for my 8 year old daughter. She's loves music, so I put it on her tablet and added kid friendly genres. She plays music nonstop now"
"December 9, 2015","Only been using for one day and it's difficult to find songs I like. It probably works better on iOS version. Would not recommend it on Android OS."
"August 8, 2015","Can't do without it after finding the comedy stations. I prefer this over buying music since my taste is forever evolving. And... it is a great way of mixing up your workout music. Lastly, I use iTunes card to pay the low monthly fee on my iPhone but listens to it through Roku, online at work, iPhone, now through my old Samsung tablet. It is awesome!"
"August 20, 2017","Love it"
"September 23, 2016","It doesnt play a good variety of the artists i selected. It plays some songs a lot."
"April 7, 2013","ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW  Current version still has a great selection and variety and almost no bugs. You have to register via email to use it now and It now has double the ads and they come in audio AND video form, usually in pairs or threes. Recently they removed the previously added time limit of a few hours a month. This means that, although you are still limited to a half dozen skips a day, you can at least listen to a station or change stations for as long as you want. This change made it regain a previously lost star and caused me to re-download it. They also added a feature to share the song on your registered pandora profile, facebook, and twitter. You still won't get that perfect song in one go, but you won't run out of time waiting for it to queue up. It's still 3.99 for unlimited ad free music. I can't give it the full 5 stars because of the amount of Ads (I understand they have to do so to provide music for free, but they are going overboard) and the need to email register an account with them (sketchy stuff that often leads to notif and junk spamming), but it has definitely earned at least one more star for getting rid of that time limit. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys music and doesn't mind sitting through less favorite songs and ads to hear their top picks (like we used to do with the radio, before lime wire and kazaa)  ORIGINAL REVIEW: It has a great selection and variety, almost no bugs, and tolerable ads. However, recently they added a time limit that is only a few hours a month! I could see an hour a day, but if you listen as often as I do, this means you can only use the app within the first few days of a month. First week, tops. This would make it acceptable for people who only listen for a song every now and then, but you still only get 6 skips an hour per station, so you won't get that perfect song in one go, and if you wait to hear it you'll run out of time for the month. Of course you can buy the 3.99 app and pay for unlimited ad free music or even pay .99 when your times up to keep listening for the month, but let's face it, this app was used too much without enough revenue so they are gonna force us to pay or suffer. Meanwhile, I'll be finding a new app."
"April 11, 2015","Love it! There are so many options of music genres available. There is definitely something for everyone. We like it much more than the music stations available on cable, and even using our own iPods."
"August 9, 2016","I love this cause its got good music and fun to pick out what you more or less like to hear."
"March 25, 2016","I listen to the music nearly everyday and I play the music for my dogs when I go out. It really sets the mood in the house."
"November 7, 2015","My favorite App 'Pandora'. I cannot live without Pandora app at home and work. All different kinds of music stations you can choose and play. 💕💕"
"March 29, 2016","i'm new to this,,music skips every few minutes, otherwise it works fine but to many ads to buy stuff....enough already OUY"

"August 14, 2014","I love, love, love Pandora. It player my music I like,and you can invite your friends. I like to listen to it,when I'm cleaning,Re riding in a car. Great with ear buds if your waiting to get in for a appointment. High 5 this one!!!!"
"January 1, 2017","I enjoy listening to music without all the talking commercials"
"August 19, 2017","They are the greatest, I got a nice selection of gospel music."
"August 14, 2017","It drop song on a regular basis. Never seems o work properly."
"May 20, 2015","I LOVE Pandora and all the variety of music I have access to. I upgraded to Pandora One because I didn't want the advertisements. For me, it's totally worth 4.99 a month for uninterrupted music."
"December 7, 2016","I want to listen to just some songs not all the the artist sings."
"August 16, 2016","I like the ability to pick and choose what I want to hear, that I can shuffle the music. I"
"January 19, 2014","to listen to music MY way. I have Pandora running on my desktop quite often, already have my favorite stations set up and was very pleased the Kindle Pandora app synced quickly and had my favorites right there. Now I can listen wherever I am to what I want to hear. One of my favorite app's."
"May 4, 2017","💩😧😈🐈😈🐈😈🐈😴😎"
"January 8, 2014","My kids, my husband, myself all use pandora for its variety. I love that they come out with stations that are for every occasion. We played the Christmas station for the month of December and I play classical at school for my students to listen to. Ads are not too bad for getting free version!"
"December 28, 2014","When I search for a film score of a movie it plays other movie scores that I am not interested in; in fact, it often plays other film score music first; thumbs down on a song does not exclude other songs from the same movie"
"July 3, 2016","Get great music. If you want to listen to your kind of music, I'm sure you will find it with Pandora."
"June 22, 2017","Great!"
"December 27, 2016","When I first started Pandora I would give it five stars now I give it for because they repeat songs entirely too much"
"December 17, 2016","Great to have any music genre at any moment I want to hear it."
"December 17, 2016","Great!! because I choose what I want to hear, just the best!!!"
"May 13, 2013","I love the ""Pandora"" app. I love the the ability to use my Pandora account from my KINDLE . I haven't had any problems with the application . It works smoothly with no lags or glitches. I wish the exit option was a little more easier to access but,other than that, The Pandora App is a wonderful thing to have on your KINDLE Fire..."
"August 7, 2015","So far it has been pretty good no complaints yet. There are ads but they can be ignored with a simple touch of the close button. The music I grew up with is right there so far."
"June 19, 2014","I gave Pandora this rating because I have not been able to register. I filled out all of the information but it keeps telling me that they are experiencing technical difficulty."
"October 12, 2016","I listen to Pandora all the time-couldn't live without my Americana stations."
"May 1, 2017","I love pandora media. One of the best in music."
"September 3, 2015","I like this much more than I thought I would! I've tried others and they all have their own little niche, and hence, they are all a bit different but this one suits my needs perfectly. I don't want to listen to a whole album, I just want to listen to some of the tracks from my favorite artists and that's exactly what this provides. Of course it would be fantastic to have the best of all of these types of apps together in one app but that would cost a fortune. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of data that this doesn't use.....of course it could be much better, but compared to others, this uses a lower amount of data. There are a ton of visual advertisements!!! But, I use this on my phone and I minimize it so that I don't see them. I don't know if that helps keep the amount of data usage lower but like I said, compared to other music streaming apps this is far superior."
"December 4, 2013","I like this so much better than the Slacker app. It just seems like Pandora is a lot better at picking music that I like instead of Slacker. Slacker will play some raaaaaaaandom stuff! I like that with the ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" feature, you can fine-tune your musical tastes."
"May 7, 2015","We listen to this all the time since I downloaded. My oldest daughter usually snatches my phone up as soon as we get in the car and plays her favorite stations. Yep. It's a huge hit!!!! LOVE IT!!!"

"January 30, 2017","Really good! So many choices, but there are way too many ads."
"March 17, 2014","Sometimes it does something weird and says there are no songs available on this station. Don't know how to fix it. Usually just have to wait for it to resolve on it's own."
"September 29, 2016","I have been a user of Pandora for several years. I recently purchased an Amazon Fire Tablet. This app was downloaded on the Fire Tablet. Good selection and works well on the Fire."
"September 10, 2016","Great for listening to music. Enjoy building my own stations with my favorite music"
"March 9, 2016","Musics good but there's too many commercials, and I don't want to have to pay to listen to something that I can listen to free"
"August 7, 2015","It just updated and now it just skips songs without playing anything."
"February 21, 2016","The Galaxy."
"August 10, 2016","Seems to have good music,with out too many commercial interruptions. I've been enjoying it."
"July 19, 2017","Great"

"May 29, 2017","Great"
"October 5, 2013","Love Pandora and to create stations by artist! Great music!!! Guaranteed best music by similar artist continuously! Discover new artists, too!"
"December 21, 2013","I used to listen to Pandora everyday while I was doing computer work it was very good however when the upgraded it, it is no longer able to play on my tablet, which I use quite often it works really well on my phone though"
"December 15, 2013","I love Pandora. I was using serious radio at work and my radio broke. I had a kindle that I never used in my closet. My son told me I could download Pandora and use it at work. Everyone loves it at work. We are all happy again. I love the variety of music. Thank you from my crew at Smoker Friendly!"
"August 30, 2013","I appreciate the many categories of music to choose from. Even in the Classical music genre there are multiple venues."
"July 18, 2017","Like the integration with Alexa!"
"January 3, 2017","Long time user of Pandora. I love it. Highly recommended it."
"December 29, 2016","I love Pandora Radio. I have been listening to it for years."
"May 15, 2015","Music selection is very good. I just don't like it when they keep wanting the thumbs up or down. Or when they THINK I will like something and try to shove that down my throat, er, that is ears."
"June 10, 2014","Pandora has created the perfect app for use with our Kindle Fire - very easy to use - minimum ads - during the first week of use took care to rate those recordings I liked or disliked - after one week Pandora was right on with preferences. Thanks Pandora Media."
"February 13, 2016","I install Pandora wherever I can. I really enjoy choosing my categories and love the variety they provide within those categories."
"January 31, 2016","The alarm goes off. That's cool. If you so much as touch it, it turns completely off. No snooze -nothing! Was 1 1\2 hrs late to work."
"December 2, 2016","It's great. I like the replay feature, but there are lots of ads"
"December 6, 2016","Choose your music, personalize it for you. Stream it and enjoy."
"February 22, 2015","nice"
"August 2, 2016","If the Thumbprint Radio section played only your thumb ""up"" picks it would be great."
"January 4, 2015","Doesn't work well on my Kendall but I love to use it on my Ipod. Not a lot of radio stations where I live but with this I can listen to my favorite music and once I thumbs down a song I don't like it won't play anymore."
"September 7, 2013","Pandora is the best thing since sliced bread! Make me a better person when I hear a song and can read/sing the words without looking all dumb and confused! Love how it gives me all the 411 needed, to purchase song/album! I have found a bunch of new favorite artists/songs, I didn't even know I had! =) 100% the best!!"
"August 9, 2016","LIsten to it often. Several channels, like how you can customize the music to some extent."
"July 25, 2017","Excellent and enjoyable experience every time"
"May 23, 2017","I like Pandora but the adds are too frequent."
"June 11, 2013","Great app...it is very easy to use. Once you log in you do not need to log in each time, this can be a good thing as long as you don't forget your e-mail address that you used and password! The only negative are the occasional commercials, but they are not long! You also need to click that you are still listening every so often!"
"August 3, 2017","I love being able to listen to music I like whenever I want"
"January 18, 2017","Have not been using the app as I should...will keep trying."
"January 2, 2017","Pretty much what the rest of the internet radio supplies..."
"August 30, 2016","Don't know why I waited so long. I love it. Easy to use. Had it for couple days now and have several stations I created to suit my moods and pleasure. Purchased a bluetooth speaker to free me from the ear buds. As long as I have my Kindle Fire or my Smart phone I can have my favorite music any time I want."
"April 25, 2016","Love listening to the music I selected. Based on your selections this program will play similar songs and artists."
"July 20, 2016","cool i like the thumbs up choice and then they make you a station according to your thumbs up,"
"March 9, 2016","Great music. I don't have search for music, I just choose a song and all the music I love just come rolling in. Easy to use!"
"July 30, 2015","You need an email, and account for it. It's a great app. A radio you get to pick genre, artist, or track, while also playing songs you might like based off what you listen to!"
"August 21, 2015","Better than mix radio. It stays within the genre you choose. The ads are not that bad, similar to regular radio. The cost to upgrade is to much which i only gave 4 stars."
"January 3, 2016","Good selection of songs. A lot of ads. Nice that they offer you a free uninterrupted hour of music from time to time. Sometimes freezes up."
"September 29, 2015","decent selection of genres - plus you can create your own stations. i won't complain about the ads as i haven't gotten around to paying for ad-free listening..."
"July 2, 2016","Pandora has the music I like and creating stations is easy. Plays on my bluetooth device with ease"
"July 14, 2016","What's not to like? Music where and when I want it. I customize to my taste and it's reliable."
"June 1, 2016","I love Pandora I use it quite a bit on my phone and computer so I thought why not my kindle fire as well."
"September 5, 2012","the music sounds better, but there is an odd popping noise between songs. the music skips sometimes and the volume controls are all jacked up. if i control the volume via the app, it is barley audible at high volume. if i turn it up on the device and then go into the app, the app mutes. if i use device controls while IN the app, all it does is get lower, not higher. fix please!"
"July 22, 2016","Love how the station customizes to my preferences and the ease in which it's done on my part."
"August 31, 2014","With the latest BlackBerry update, Amazon AP Store can be leveraged to download Android apps to Blackberry 10 devices. So far all of the apps I have tried work well, which is great as the best apps are often unavailable in native BlackBerry OS."
"September 20, 2013","Some of the channels are limited in song selection (especially if you're into Big Band, Sinatra, etc.)---may hear the same tune several times in any one session. I'm also against listening to Christmas songs in July, and I haven't discovered how to move it to my Christmas station without deleting it completely."
"March 6, 2017","Listen only to what you like & when!"
"January 23, 2017","I think this is by far the best streaming radio out there."
"February 21, 2014","I like Pandora because it saves me a lot of time and the effort it takes to download music. I don't have to clutter up the drive on my device by saving a lot of music. Once Pandora gets to know you and your tastes, it's great. I love all types of music, so it works out great for me."
"January 4, 2017","Very much enjoy being able to choose music from any genre."
"December 21, 2013","Pandora is a wonderful app--you can select the type of music you want to listen to. My only complaint is that it doesn't have an easily located disconnect button. Because of the data that it gobbles, I try o only listen to it when I'm using WiFi, and if I'm leaving the area, it would be nice to have a quick disconnect method."
"December 19, 2015","Music hardly found in the marketplace is found here. Thank you for your excellent assortment of pieces representing the culture of our fathers"
"July 21, 2016","My husband uses this more than me....and He loves it.  Thanks, Dierdre Aguilar"
"July 29, 2017","have it on my tv"
"December 14, 2016","Excellent transaction with fast delivery. Thank you AAA+++"
"April 15, 2017","Hate all the ads"
"May 9, 2014","If you love music, Pandora is the app for you. Search for your favourite artist, genre, decade or take jaunt on a random channel. Easy to use. Free with occasional commercials or pay a small fee to be free of commercials. Either way you will find this is a great app!"
"September 1, 2016","Pick a song or band and its an endless stream of similar. Best streaming music app."
"May 22, 2015","Sometimes you just need a radio to play because your stuck on what to listen to. It's a good app I recommend it. Review review review review review review review review review review review"
"October 2, 2016","Great tool for downloading music. It's nice how the search option is set up."
"February 8, 2017","Pandora offers a great selection of music genres and choices...definitely recommended!"
"February 27, 2016","Downloaded on my BlackBerry Passport, works perfect on my BB10 OS! Hope you have the same experience as I have! Just love it!"

"September 4, 2017","Always a pleasant experience."
"April 21, 2017","Awesome even with commercial."
"March 29, 2016","I love Pandora!!!! I recommend that you get this app😀😀😀"
"January 31, 2017","I like the selection of music. I only use the free stuff."
"December 6, 2015","I fully recommend this app. I enjoy having the personalized radio feel and don't like how you have to pay for the mobile with apps like spotify."
"September 18, 2013","I am really enjoying my Pandora App on my Kindle. I love being able to choose the music I want to listen to and to have such a huge variety of artists and songs available to me! Anyone that enjoys music and in all setting would enjoy the Pandora App. I found Pandora very easy to navigate and make my choices."
"June 12, 2014","I like Pandora because you can use radio stations other people have set up or set up your own. You can specify the artists and make a single radio station for that artist. For a nominal fee it's a great tool and you can have fun making your own radio station available."
"March 20, 2017","My favorite app"
"January 9, 2013","I love Pandora for my personal use. It also offers great kids clean versions of songs, must be supervised by an adult of course as they can see what's in their parents favorite stations as well. The only improvement I would like to see is being able to have a kids only version so if I'm not looking they can't accidentally select something inappropriate."
"March 20, 2013","Since I started using Pandora on my phone 3mo ago, I haven't had the need to download any new songs. I feel like I have a Genius playlist that's great at mixing it up. I love also how I can customize my stations. The ads really don't bother me either so I wouldn't bother wasting my money for an ad-free experience for 3.99/mo or whatever it is."
"October 12, 2017","It's find with me"
"April 22, 2013","I love this app. it has every kind of music you can imagine so no one will be unhappy. The quality of music is great. It works very well on my kindle and my android phone. The only draw back are the commercials and when it asks me if I'm still listening, which I understand why it does that. But with it being free I can't really complain."
"August 24, 2016","I totes love Pandora! I love listening to all of my favorite music! Love love love love love love it it love it love it love jcfhbtgbhrdcvjrv"
"October 14, 2016","Pandora rarely fails me. Great selection :) and great app never freezes!"
"December 9, 2012","Pandora is a great music player that allows you to play a variety music by genre, artist and even theme. The functionality and ease of use are top notch. The only knock I have against it are the very intrusive audio ads. These ads are the only deterrent to me listening more. Even the pesky pop up ads are more bearable than the intrusive audio interruptions."
"July 14, 2014","I love Pandora than any other music app. I have Pandora on my Tv and phone and I never have a problem with uploading to hear my favorite station. There are quite a few advertisements that pop in between the radio station that doesn't bother me at all."
"October 29, 2015","Pandora is like Amazon always there for you, and each time you meet they grab you by the hand and show you something new they know you'll like !!!!!!!!!"
"January 24, 2016","This app doesn't work nearly as well on Kindle as it does on an iphone/iPad. Actually being able to play music on it is hit or miss."
"September 17, 2016","My music, my way - all the time! I upgraded to the ad-free version. Love it!"
"July 27, 2014","Pandora has all the free music in the world I really love this app you can listen to music on any device from your phone to your computer I love all the free music"
"July 19, 2017","Great music!!! Enjoyed it tremendously!!!"
"July 22, 2017","Excellent music 🎶. Good customer service!"
"January 5, 2015","You should be able to search for a song and hear that exact song. Other than that, this is an amazing app. I used to only listen to country, but now I am listening to Christina Perri, Passenger, and Imagine Dragons."
"October 23, 2017","Easy to use. Great selection"
"November 28, 2014","My grandma, my mom, my brother, and me. Listion to songs when we are down, doing work, and relaxing and Pandora one is always there for us. So it is a five star so thank you how created Pandora one. Will back to my music."
"September 1, 2017","Pandora is the best thing ever, I love it I give it a 10"
"September 23, 2017","Pandora is a great station. I long it!! Keep it going!!!"
"September 22, 2017","Plays what I want to hear n enjoy when I want to listen."

"January 10, 2017","I am just loving my tablet and all that I can do with it"
"January 31, 2017","Switched to another media that was more towards my needs"
"May 26, 2016","Endless music selection the only down side is after you like so many songs they wear them out after that"
"December 15, 2016","Really like the new feature that plays all your 👍 songs."
"April 9, 2014","There are a lot os station formats, but you hear the same songs on a lot of the. It nags if you just listen and do not give thumbs up or down on every song, I like it for listening to a lot of songs from a single artist, and the suggestions for similar artists are handy."
"February 16, 2016","Love it. My boss blocked the Pandora web site but I can still listen to the app. Great tunes. I can't believe this is free."
"June 20, 2014","Pandora is one the apps I use daily, and I absolutely adore it. There is a big problem with Pandora ever since the new update came. Pandora will now play 2 or 3 songs and then freeze up and stall. I'm not liking that at all. This problem needs to be fixed."
"August 30, 2016","Use it everyday. and love it..I also love how you can customize your own music selection :)"
"August 10, 2016","I am thoroughly enjoying my Pandora app. Easy download, free,nwhat more could you ask."
"February 5, 2014","Love that I can pick the type of music that I love. I was disappointed though because when I put in my favorite Ricky Nelson in, it really just gave me that kind of music, but not necessarily Ricky Nelson. I would have loved a bunch of his music. Otherwise, I really like Pandora."
"January 28, 2013","Pandora is wonderful I have it everywhere, kindle, Directtv and iPhone. They are each geared to what I want on each one according to the location I use my units. I have tried similar apps and they were time consuming and took more patience than what I had to learn and use. Pandora is great, if you don't have it get it today! You will be glad you did."
"March 4, 2013","I love pandora radio. first I love that its easy to use. Second the music is great you can put a artist or genre & it plays the songs .. what I also love is that you can search music from a certain time for example the 70's and it plays music exactly from that time only. I have found so many songs I have been looking for using pandora! Love it!"
"January 5, 2014","I found Pandora in 2008, and loved the idea so much I signed up for Pandora|ONE as soon as it was released. We rarely, if ever, listen to broadcast radio anymore and use Pandora almost exclusively. The app is great, does what it's supposed to do - nothing more, nothing less, and it works."
"December 3, 2016","Love the music and customizing my stations to what I enjoy."
"June 13, 2016","I love this station. Love gospel music and only place I can find old fashioned gospel music. Thanks"
"October 14, 2017","great way to listen to music on the move."
"January 14, 2013","I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD 7"", my Droid X smartphone and also on the computer. It is the best ""free"" radio app on the market in my opinion because the more you listen and like certain songs that they play the more custom of a radio station you end up with. There are also not a lot of repeats which keeps things from getting boring."
"July 9, 2015","Easy format to use. Just hate that it times out on me or if I get texted, anything with a sound notificationcall it stops. I do not pay for the service I don't mind comercials."
"August 21, 2017","Love the music and the ease"
"August 26, 2017","Great selection easy to use"
"January 5, 2017","I love listening what I get to choose., thanks pandora"
"February 9, 2017","Alot Of Commercials Other Than That A Excellent Product"
"December 2, 2016","Tons of stations great app. U can rate the song or station."
"September 22, 2014","Exactly what you would want / expect from the pioneers of the personalized free radio app. The advertising is appropriately spaced and the accuracy of the music selection to something i enjoy about 85% of the time right from the start."
"September 16, 2016","I love Pandora but not on the this tablet. It drains the battery too quickly!"
"June 25, 2016","great way to have music for everyday life to chill by or clean by or just to sit back and relax"
"April 9, 2014","If you love music and have love many different types of music...this is your kinda app. You can create your own stations...bypass songs that have no interest...and tweek it so it's all your favorites in one. This is a must have on your phone, laptop or kindle. Rock on!"
"August 29, 2016","LOVE Pandora! It makes available all the music I love. So glad I found this app."
"June 9, 2017","Love this app"
"September 10, 2016","An amazing app with a huge variety of music. But is 4stars due to all the adds"
"October 16, 2013","Great music option for those areas with poor radio selections. You get to listen to what you like and not all of the other junk thrown at you. Can't go wrong with this download app. Don't like the commercials so I purchased the full version. No more commercials. The price isn't that bad for a paid app."
"March 13, 2016","Would not access my email or password even knoinv they were right I will not download this I would suggest iHeartRadio"
"February 16, 2016","I have enjoyed Pandora now for a number of years and am delighted!!! with its service! A good selection and wonderful sound."
"November 22, 2016","Technology has come a l-o-n-g way since the days of AM radio!"
"August 24, 2015","I wrote a review for another station but meant Serius XM. The con pet is great but the selection doesn't Inc laude enough of the songs of the original artist chosen."
"February 10, 2014","As far as I'm concerned, for what Pandora is, it is the best choice. I haven't been overwhelmed with ads so far. I hope this doesn't change because I have deleted Pandora from some other devices for that reason. You can choose an eclectic (sp) mix of playlists and enjoy everyone."
"July 19, 2015","Love music and Pandora is a simple way to stream music. You can choose what you want to listen to and you can customize it to your taste. Great app. Easy to install and use."
"December 18, 2014","Pandora works the best for me. I just want to listen to the music. I upgraded so I don't hear commercials. I also don't care to hear the on air personalities. I create the station I want and the rest is taken care of."
"July 23, 2016","II would like to be able to save certain songs to create my own station, not just genres."
"March 29, 2016","I am still new at this, but sure has a lot of music I like. Still trying to figure out how I can use it on my Echo."
"July 5, 2016","Love Pandora. Play it at home and on the boat. Now that I have a Bose speaker, even better."
"September 13, 2016","KEPT POPPING UP AND INTERFERING WITH CURRENT PROCT HAVW DELETED MAY TRY ON PC"
"May 5, 2016","I love Pandora. The app works great and there is so much music. It comes in clearly on my phone and my car!"
"March 15, 2016","The greatest invention since the light bulb. Listen to it all day. Pandora-one with add free music is a definite take!"
"September 6, 2017","Love pandora. Great music!"
"January 10, 2017","love Pandora for being on the move. user friendly"
"April 23, 2014","remember to create your profile! you can create your bio and stuff! its like a following thing. there's emo people ( im emo to) and all diffrent kinds! just go to 'profile' in the top bar and vala! also you have to click the refresh bottom. see if you can find me!"
"March 4, 2015","I love the free station! I can select the types of music I like and it'll just play continuously. I don't mind the advertisements either... it's a FREE station. I love the classical music selections!"
"October 25, 2015","Pandora offers a way to individualize songs you enjoy listening to while on the computer, phone, or tablet. It's easy to set up and use but I think Amazon Prime offers a better product; one reason being that they offer entire albums as well as individual songs to Prime members. You can't beat Amazon Prime!"
"March 24, 2014","The app's function is fine. I've always loved Pandora, but it seems like over the last year or so,there are more commercials than music. Also, be careful of what songs you like, the programs will start to meld together, regardless what channel or artist station you're on."
"December 19, 2016","Love Pandora, have been listening for last three years"
"June 22, 2013","I love Pandora. This app is great for listening to your favorite kind of music all on one station. I use it to work out when I'm at the gym, and on my commute.  Pro:  -You can ""like"" the song to make sure you get to hear it again, and give the song a thumbs down to ensure the station doesn't play it again.  -Limited commercial interruptions  -Free!  Cons:  -Can only skip a limited number of songs  -When I'm in the car it has to run on 3G which uses a lot of data"
"January 30, 2016","I listen almost every night for about 30 minutes. I enjoy almost every type of music but love hearing the 50-60s music the most."
"February 8, 2013","This app is excellent on the kindle fire, works just like the website. My one complaint is that to skip or pause songs you have to return to the app, possibly losing your place is you are doing something else. I would give this 5 stars if I could skip/pause right from the notifications tab in the top left. This would make the app much more sleek."
"November 21, 2015","The radio station of my choice music. It sets the mood for the different ways I feel, by changing the station, I can feel energy or relaxation."
"February 27, 2015","Great selection"
"May 16, 2016","I can choose my favorite music anywhere I go. It is great to play in the car, on the boat, or on a run."
"March 30, 2016","Starts out with a nice variety of music within a genre but over time you notice they are repeating the same songs."
"September 6, 2015","I mistakenly thought this would let me listen to actual my favorite radio stations. I listen to Christian radio stations for the talk shows more than the music."
"July 27, 2014","I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this app. Free music. What could go wrong. I use this app at least once a day, sometimes more. It's so easy to navigate and even thought there is ads, it won't bother you because it's just so awesome"
"December 27, 2012","I think this is a fabulous way to listen to music. Love the radio station choices geared to one;s personal preferences as well as the cross references that lead from one liked singer or group to a similar one. The only criticism I have is that the search mechanism does not include song titles. It is necessary to know who recorded the song to find it."
"July 10, 2016","I love this App. I just don't like the constant reminder that I am not logged in to iTunes."
"February 14, 2014","except for the interruptions by commercials, i like it so far... don't really want to pay for a better version though. but having a bit of a problem figuring out how to add other artists to the ""channel"" i created. but really haven't spent a bunch of time looking yet."
"January 11, 2017","Love it"
"October 23, 2015","App is great for listening to whatever music you want at the time. I use it with wireless headphones all the time, without missing calls, emails, etc."
"December 31, 2012","I have a kindle fire hd and I love listening to music. This app worked great I didn't have a problem with it at all . It's like a radio only you can skip the song if you don't like it but you can only skip so many times. So I suggest that you pick a station that you like. It's like Pandora on a regular computer only it's portable. Again love this app ."
"June 30, 2015","I really love this app it very awesome but I gave it 4 stars because you get lots of adds and only get like 15 skip the song things in a day otherwise it is the best music app"
"March 28, 2015","Pandora doesn't allow free music anymore. You either have to pay for the update and continue paying for months or you have to go on the website to listen. The app is no longer free. Waste of time."
"July 26, 2017","Has any type of music I've searched for"
"September 28, 2017","Hehehe  Jwhshsjsjsjsjsjsnsnsn"

"September 4, 2017","Love it. Use it every day"
"August 12, 2017","Great way to music I like"
"February 8, 2017","Stations do a great job of picking music that goes together well. Pandora is still probably the best at this so far."
"August 7, 2014","Love it"
"November 26, 2014","I really enjoy this app. The commercials are annoying, but if I wasn't so cheap and I actually paid for Pandora, I wouldn't have any commercials to begin with. Luckily the commercials are a good distance apart. The end."
"April 2, 2017","Great app!!"
"August 21, 2017","great music"
"December 14, 2016","I have had Pandora for years really enjoy music my way"

"April 19, 2016","I love Pandora. I can choose the kind of music I want to listen to instead of the mix you find on the radio."
"April 19, 2016","Love Pandora, I dont mind the adds.... i guess i will have to get use to them if i want free awesome music!!!"
"May 3, 2017","Best value for the money!"
"August 29, 2014","Pandora is one of the best radio stations on the Internet you have a wide varity of music I especially enjoyed the all day Christian music and I specially like it this is my a lot of commercials and what are the top rating radio stations."
"July 16, 2014","I just love Pandora. You can set up your own station or select a station for the type of music you desire to listen to. You can use the free version or pay a small amount to avoid advertisement. Pandora works great on my Kindle and Android phone."
"September 8, 2016","Many great features but consistent bugs drag this app down. QC is not good."
"September 16, 2014","I enjoyed every bit of the music provided by Pandora Media and i recommend it highly. My family are all musically incline people and the exposure of good music...has always taken us to the next level. Don't hesitate...jump on board."
"March 2, 2016","I've used Pandora for years and like the convenience of selecting what I want to listen to. The ads can be irritating."
"November 5, 2013","I really like this Pandora app because I may choose the type of music. I then can choose a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" in order to refine the choices that Pandora gives me. I simply put it on and it plays the music I like so I may relax during my breaks at work. This is great!"
"February 4, 2016","Great source of music customized just for me. Love it!"
"May 17, 2017","Find my favorite music on hereeeee! :)"
"August 11, 2017","HAVING FUN LISTENING....... THANK YOU!"

"October 25, 2017","Love Pandora- the music selections are always great!"
"August 29, 2017","Good selection of music."
"June 26, 2016","The best music"
"June 7, 2013","Pandora is the best music app out there. Easy to understand and plays great songs. The one bad part is they limit ur free listening to 40 hours a month. After that you either pay .99 for the rest of the add supported month or buy the non add supported unlimited listening. I listen at work all day so my time is up in a week."
"September 8, 2015","Pandora is so convenient. I can't wait to hear what song is coming up next. I have the choice of thumbs up or down which I love. And it's free. Jan"
"January 26, 2016","I could NOT MAKE IT WORK AT ALL on my Kindle device. I have it on several other devices - no problems. I've already deleted it"
"November 19, 2016","On my Kindle it keeps cutting off, disconnecting from wifi."
"July 21, 2016","Simple cannot live without it!!! Always finding new music....love the Genome Project!!!"
"August 29, 2017","Love Music"
"May 25, 2015","Pandora was good at one point, now every other song leads to 3 commercials and disliking a song takes 5 minutes to load, the computer version is slightly better and is way last buggy"
"September 27, 2013","So far I've had this app for about a month now on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Plays in the background while I'm working other apps and is way better then Spotify. I had Spotify for a week and I hated it. Only drawback it that it drains battery power pretty fast. but I guess that's to be expected."
"August 19, 2016","It's the best music station. I just love, love, love all of their music choices."
"October 15, 2012","Love being able to pinpoint the kind of music I want to listen to. Love being able to vote down music that I don't like and thumbs up to music I especially enjoy so the station will seek more of the same.  Like being able to choose different venues to suit my mood.  one of my most favorite and freqently used ap on my Kindle Fire"
"September 14, 2016","Love the free streaming and the commercials don't last too painfully long!"
"December 9, 2016","Enjoy being able to se up my own favorites. Thank you!"
"February 6, 2016","I can say it is great, and, then it bad great : lets you listen to music bad : have to have an Internet connection"
"December 9, 2016","Will not let me login. Keeps saying there is a problem"
"July 23, 2015","I like Pandora, but the only things I don't like are: 1: ADS!😠 2: KIDZ BOP (Childrens) radio ever has actual KIDZ BOP on it very much! 😑Other than that, I like it! 😊"
"October 6, 2014","I love Pandora. I had it on my computer for years and have lots of good stations. Just put it on my Kindle so I could take it with me.  I like the old Jimmy Rogers songs and Roy Bookbinder,you can't hear them just any place."
"March 19, 2015","Pandora was perfect in every way until I heard a Monsanto advertisement. I am completely against Monsanto (nothing good comes from that ugly company), I deleted Pandora. Highly disappointed. Booo."
"August 17, 2016","Don't want to turn it off once I begin listening. Great fit, form and function."
"April 28, 2013","We don't have music at work, so I took my tablet in this week, downloaded Pandora and started enjoying my days. Time goes by so much quicker when you have music you enjoy listening to. I get to decide if today will be pop, soft rock or country, or just music similar to some of my favorites. I really enjoy picking the all 80's or all 90's stations and easing through my day with great music. Pandora is SUPER and I am glad it is out there for me to enjoy. And I am just now learning how extensive this media is and I look forward to hearing it ALL!"
"December 10, 2014","I am very appreciative of this app. I recently discovered it and I am wondering why I was not informed about this app. I really like it, right now I am just in one artist, but I am enjoying it. THANK YOU !!!!!"
"July 24, 2017","Enjoy the variety of music available."
"July 18, 2017","Good for grandkids to relax and sleep"

"January 7, 2017","Love the many choicest I have to all types of music"
"December 24, 2016","Hoping you have more variety on Pablo Alboran songs"
"February 14, 2017","Near flawless streaming while I work on other apps."
"January 12, 2017","Wish the lyrics were available in the free version."
"June 26, 2017","It's my go to music app"
"October 7, 2017","Great stories of who would have thought."
"December 21, 2013","I've been an occasional listener to Pandora. I was recently talking to a friend about her music playing in the background since it was one well placed song after another. She told me it was Pandora and how ridiculously inexpensive it is, $36 a year! I signed up, noticed the advertising gone, but more, since I had put some cash on the line, I wanted to check out my purchase. I have been stunned at the well coordinated genres of music that has been combined on My Own radio station. How do you go so seamlessly from Dixie Chicks, through Norah Jones and Steve Winwood, to Journey, with perfect song selection from each?! Really invigorating! I'm hooked!! Thank you Pandora! What a concept so well fulfilled!"
"February 9, 2014","Pandora has always been my favorite. I listen to it all the time. And this app is really well made. I would highly recommend. Pandora always has my vote."
"June 15, 2017","awesome!!"
"November 9, 2015","Love Pandora!"
"November 25, 2015","Key Bank app dos not allow for on line bank deposits.  I wanted this feature.  It tune s has a better app that does this"
"April 19, 2016","I've listened to Pandora for several years now. you can tailor your account to the type of music you like.."
"September 5, 2016","I absolutely love having all the different artists available to me at once."
"August 13, 2014","Pandora is the best music streaming app around. The matchups are great. But the lyrics get mixed up a lot, and hardly any songs show who features in it. For some reason, sometimes my comments don't publish, but just on Kindle, not on iOS."
"May 14, 2016","Brings all of my Pandora music selections to my Kindle Fire. That's my daily lunch-time sound track."
"July 22, 2015","Whatever your taste, Pandora has got it. Furthermore, Pandora often plays other musicians of the same genre as what you select, thereby broadening your musical horizon."
"May 22, 2016","Wonderful tune it up yourself Internet Radio with many free features available. Great app to have."
"December 16, 2016","They play all the country songs that I really like."
"June 25, 2014","Because your one of the best and first, period. When I first got a smartphone pandora was the name that was being mention by word of mouth. There was no advertising that I seen. A coworker informed me about Pandora. I was hooked from the beginning.."
"February 5, 2015","Pandora has introduced me to new artists that I would never have heard otherwise. It is convenient to have all of my own ""radio stations"" Pandora give me many delightful musical hours."
"July 18, 2017","All the products got in fine. Thanks"
"November 30, 2014","I'd say I love it but for one quirky habit it has of replaying the same songs over and over... and often the least liked of all the songs in my preferred ""alternative"" repertoire. Other than that - nifty app!"
"December 27, 2016","Doesn't easily sync with Bluetooth speaker devices"
"February 10, 2017","love Pandora!! i will probably be upgrading soon.."
"January 11, 2017","Great variety of music, easy to navigate, love it."
"January 25, 2017","I love that they find similar songs I would enjoy."
"March 8, 2017","Best app in the world!"
"September 29, 2016","I love getting to make my own channels of the songs I love to hear!!!"
"December 2, 2016","Works nicely with my Echo Dot. I would recommend it..."
"August 11, 2014","Just when you need that something extra to make your day, Pandora Radio, with it's variety of music stations to fit your mood (or get you into a better mood!) comes thru loud and clear. -Lon- @ http://infofaucet.com/members-2/marriagetips/"

"August 25, 2017","very it."
"August 15, 2016","I used to have it and it worked fine but now it won't let me register right now"
"January 11, 2016","I love Pandora, but it's a bit different from when I first started using it about two years ago. It won't play the songs I want."
"October 24, 2015","I have found Pandora most satisfying and current in the genre that I prefer but they also play some of the older songs and this is enjoyable also."
"October 27, 2016","Can choose genre but not specific artist. That's a big minus."
"August 9, 2016","Great selection of music and easy thumbs up to create your own Playlist station."
"January 11, 2014","I truly enjoy the free version of Pandora. I enjoy listening to every station of music that I create, even if there's commercial. The best part is being able to listen too old song that you just don't hear on the radio. It's a great app to have on all you're electronic components."
"February 11, 2013","I have been a Pandora listener since it's inception. When the opportunity came to purchase an annual subscription I did, Pandora offers uninterupted streaming music in any genre I choose. There are always some surprises in the music selection..............good surprises. Your music anywhere and anytime. It does not get any better than that!"
"April 26, 2016","Get this app is so amazing free music at my hands its awesome no ads its fast and make your own stations"
"May 1, 2014","Great app. I finally broke down and use the pay version now. I love it! i listen to relaxation, meditation music at night when i have trouble sleeping, rock &roll when walking, blues, jazz, classical, folk, country, even a comedy 'station'. Love this app"
"August 26, 2016","Good app I use the app when I'm at work or on the road  Good music"
"September 8, 2016","I love this app. I use it every day and I love that I can listen to my music anywhere!"
"July 17, 2016","Some songs, I couldn't get, I guess, some you just don't have or have never heard of."
"May 29, 2017","haven't been able to get it to work"
"October 15, 2017","Not very user friendly on my phone."
"February 21, 2015","Pandora is my most favorite music app ever, it's perfect for anyone who wants to listen to their favorite genre of music. And all you have to do is put in your favorite bands and shuffle. I love it!!"
"July 18, 2017","the best music...and the best app.."
"February 17, 2016","Pandora is my go-to music any time of the day. Have decided to upgrade to no commercial status for a nominal $5/month."
"January 27, 2017","I love Pandora. The music gets me through my day."
"January 30, 2017","So much variety to choose from & listen to.bright"

"January 3, 2017","Would have given 5 stars if the service was free!"
"November 22, 2016","Too hard to navigate and had problems signing in."
"December 25, 2016","Excellent listening for everybody! Young and old."
"January 19, 2017","i really dont use it. amazon music is way better"
"January 27, 2017","Music playback format is great. Ads are annoying."
"January 1, 2017","Create your own station. And another, and so on!"
"April 25, 2016","I love Pandora and stream music when I'm golfing with friends. I wish the ad free version wasn't extra."
"January 13, 2014","I have had this App before in my phone and it worked good but I.couldn't keep it cause I didn't have the data to run it as much as I wanted now I have a Kindle Fire that I run on WiFi 24/7 but I can never get Pandora to work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. Very disappointed!"
"August 3, 2013","Every time I start pandora it automatically takes me to a random top 40 station, and that's not even the music I listen to. Then the only options I'm allowed are thumbs up or create new station with this track. It won't let me go to my stations I've already made our let me make a new one that's not all popppy."
"April 9, 2015","Love Pandora.. We put it on every night on 'spa radio' when getting the little one to sleep. My only complaint is you have to pay for it to be commercial free. The commercials are too loud."
"May 12, 2013","I do a lot of late night computer work and the Pandora music program is easy to load and go with lots of options for music genres to switch to since there's lots of repetition from an individual genre. The cost is reasonable. I appreciate being able to pull from different genre sources and being exposed to many more artists."
"April 14, 2014","I use this app across multiple devices. It was extremely easy to download and is very user friendly. Since my Kindle does not have expandable storage, this app allows me to listen to the musicIi love without having to transfer files and use much internal memory."
"December 2, 2016","Awesome music and i can get just what i want to hear."
"June 22, 2014","Pandora is worth the lil bit of money it costs! I have it in my car and its a lot cheaper and better then XM. XM would cost more a month then Pandora costs in a year and I don't have to listen to DJ's talk with Pandora, its just music, thats all."
"November 3, 2015","I love it but I want to be able to listen to my music on the bus with no WiFi and also love it but I really wish you could use it without WiFi."
"December 4, 2015","This is the best music site I have ever seen. I can create my own radio stations, just by entering in my favourite artists. I am amazed."
"July 7, 2016","My co-workers listen to the same stuff all the time so Pandora is a sanity saver for me"
"June 1, 2017","Love it"
"May 12, 2017","Love it"
"September 8, 2017","Love!!!"
"April 12, 2015","I love Pandora. So fun and exposes you to new music. I do not find the ads too frequent at all. I highly recommend. It seems to turn off less frequently on the phone than the desk top BTW."
"May 15, 2015","cannot live without it. I have Pandora on every device ithat I own."
"September 28, 2013","Love this app so friekin much love it u have to get it its so easy to play music and it has like th best songs get it but the only bad part is u have to have wifi to listen so if u don have wifi DONT GET IT IF U DONT HAVE WIFI"
"February 11, 2014","I chose this rating because i love this app. What i like about this app is that i can listen to all the music i like and i can have as many stations as i want there's no limit and also that i can put all my music on shuffle. I recommend this app to everyone its a great app."
"May 24, 2016","Amazon Prime Music is way better. You can stream as well as download the songs and it is ad free."
"July 26, 2013","I can't log in with my facebook account like I can online. I've tried entering the same log in info as my fb and there is no option to log in with fb. I tried to make a new account using the same email that I use for fb and it told me my email was taken. Am I just missing something here? This is so frustrating!"
"October 18, 2016","Sometimes can response slow when trying to open and reload app."
"August 29, 2013","Love that I can access my paid Pandora account on my Kindle Fire. I use it constantly. Thanks for the app!"
"April 16, 2013","I like Pandora a great deal. The occasional talking is disturbing, however. Also, the music occasionally stops and the tablet computer shuts down. Sometimes I turn the tablet off, and Pandora keeps playing. There should be a quick overview available for these common problems. If there is one, it should be more obvious to locate."
"May 19, 2016","So happy that I am able to have Pandora playing while I'm in other apps. Great song selection too."
"May 7, 2014","being in my 60's, or because I have an eclectic taste in music, it has become hard to find a radio station that carries more that 2 or 3 artist's work. With this, I select the artists I want to hear that day, hit shuffle and I'm good for the day! Love it!"
"April 22, 2014","I really like the pandora app. It is easy to use has a wide variety of music, and I like that I am able to create my own playlists. It also shows the lyrics of the songs which is pretty cool. The new feature also has an alarm clock by playing music you choose."
"September 17, 2016","Better than FM and does not charge a monthly fee like satellite radio."
"August 9, 2013","Pandora is a convenient way to access music and playlists. I have found that the music I've chosen to create the playlist have been spot on and it's as though Pandora knows exactly what music I like. However, I don't like being forced to listen to commercials, especially the same commercials over and over."
"July 1, 2016","Good for when on Wi-Fi and away from good radio stations, or only rap crap is available."
"January 28, 2013","Use Pandora all the time. Considering getting the paid version, less/no advertising. Even though I could get my satellite radio providers service, Pandora is better because you can control what you want to listen to vs having to listen to what is being broadcast at the time. Pandora has more options and works for me and my family!"
"March 2, 2016","Your programming and offering of various music formats are timely.I truly appreciate this media outlet.Thank you..."
"September 8, 2015","I have loved Pandora since I first started using it. Great place to listen to music. I've tried others but have never been as pleased as o am with Pandora."
"February 24, 2014","The interface is very easy to setup and use. Lyrics automatically displayed for the selected song. Creating favorite stations is so fun it's addictive! Only drawback is that the startup page doesn't have an option to save the users email address for login."
"September 16, 2016","i use this alot and dont really have any problems on my windows phone."
"August 12, 2015","Only 4 STARS because when I put pause on my music it did not pause and went to another station. I was so mad but free music that is what everyone loves yay free."
"August 11, 2016","Absolutely love Pandora. Gives such a great range of music even on one particular station. Love how I can like the songs and go back at any time to see all the songs I have a thumbs up too. It replays the songs I like a sufficient amount of times but never too excessive! Great app!"
"May 24, 2017","You'd be crazy not to love Pandora"
"September 6, 2017","Love that I can load it to my Echo"
"January 5, 2017","Love this app, always music I want to listen to."
"December 21, 2016","Very impressed with all the choices and clarity."
"December 6, 2016","someone use my credit card without my permossion"
"July 2, 2016","I really don't like the ads. There will be ads telling me about the ""ad free"" listening I'm taking part in and I'm sure I don't have to explain why this irks me. There are also ads almost every time I skip a song or switch stations. Otherwise I love this app. I have a station for pretty much any mood I have and a variety to cover whatever else I'd enjoy hearing. Favorite part is it's free. I won't pay for the ad free, I just turn it down or tune it out."
"August 17, 2017","It cuts off too much"
"May 23, 2017","I just like Pandora."
"January 4, 2016","This is the only app that will play over my other apps, is really nice when i want to listen to music and read at the same time."
"September 6, 2014","This app works great for the most part. The alarm clock setting is just hit or miss. Sometimes it decides to go off and other times it doesn't."
"October 20, 2013","Five stars easy, the music and other programs offered on Pandora are what I enjoy listening too. Also they don't have signal drop and now I have it on my Kindle Fire, I am able to move around and listen before I select the programing I want. AOL radio doesn't work more than half the time and I have gotten an on screen message several times saying to try again later, when I do, still nothing. Pandora is good listening and I really don't mind the comms that are a part of the free programing either. Bill"
"January 2, 2017","I LOVE PANDORA!! A must have when you love music like I do"
"December 18, 2014","A great streaming service. I don't all the commercials, but I suppose I should just bite the bullet and pay for the premium subscription. Great playlists."
"June 3, 2016","Pandora radio is my favorite!! I love it and I'm addicted. It's my go-to for my music choices!"
"April 12, 2014","I absolutely love Pandora!!! I listen to it practically all day or whenever I can. Free music and unlimited stations, what is better than that?! Great app. Absolutely perfect :3 ;)"
"July 29, 2016","If you like music as much as I do and you cant live without it than this is the app for you it has every song you. could ever imagine. And you can also set alarm clocks so this is how I walk up to go to school."
"November 5, 2016","Love the music!!!"
"October 23, 2017","AAA+++"
"May 7, 2016","I can combine several of my favorites and ""quick mix"" for an enjoyable afternoon or evening."
"June 26, 2015","I really like the ministry service provided by Pandora and the way the different artist are randomly chosen with music styles. Excellent collection of old and new artists."
"May 6, 2013","I downloaded and installed Pandora on my Kindle Fire. I created a station and everything seemed to work fine. However when I walked away and returned, the station was no longer functioning. Turns out that the ap requires you to interact with it from time to time or it shuts down the station. This stinks! I switched to another streamer that does not require me to be glued to my screen. Pandora better fix this or they will quickly be OBE."
"October 9, 2016","i love it, can get all the really old songs , i am in 7th heaven"
"May 16, 2014","I don't know how I had ever survived without Pandora! I was a satellite radio fan until I moved to where I could not install the antenna properly to receive it. I was waiting for the right time to compile an MP3 collection, for years. But I was always more in love with the spontaneity of radio. You know something is really one of your favorite things if the only regret you have with it is why hadn't I discovered it sooner. I could have had so much more fun and so many less boring drives and so many less years of wondering when I was going to have the time and money to develop an extensive MP3 collection that would be able to come anywhere close to the # of my favorite songs that exist in the world. The thumbs up/thumbs down feature really is what you should pay attention to, because that is what really personalizes the station for you. You will be surprised how many new artists/songs that you might like that you may never have heard otherwise. I didn't even know i was interested in new artists until their style so logically followed my other old favorite styles of songs & artists. It's an ingenious system. So fun, so little work"
"August 9, 2016","It's great ...  I'm using it all the time..work, on the road and at night"
"March 7, 2014","Pandora is amazing even with the fact if you skip a song you don't like it play a short ad but hey maybe those song might actually be good. The best is that is got me to try new bands I would have skip otherwise because I just never stop and listen so it great for just that."
"November 8, 2016","Love the music media. Thank you for the great selections."
"April 10, 2014","Good sounding music but you can't search for music you want to hear and play it. You just put in a group or song and than they choose to play music that sounds similar to the group or song you entered earlier. Also you can't record what you are listening to.."
"December 29, 2016","Awesome"
"December 18, 2016","Bought the prime pandora and am so happy that I did!"
"January 28, 2014","easy to set up stations that play the types of music I want. the ads/commercials are only slightly annoying...but not so annoying that I want to pay for a subscription. I particularly like the feature where I can read the lyrics so that I know what they're actually saying!"
"January 3, 2017","I listen to Pandora, all day every day at work."
"January 11, 2017","Always there for me. Makes my work go so faster"
"December 29, 2016","very payy with music selections and ease of use"
"January 13, 2017","Great choices for this baby boomer!!! Love it!!"
"July 23, 2017","Everything great except for the advertisements."
"February 17, 2016","The app randomly saves pictures of a black and white Pandora Radio icon. I don't know why but I'm getting sick of it."
"May 12, 2016","Excellent media coverage - all series of music are available and ready without any cost or hassle."
"December 15, 2016","Love to listen to the Hawaiian music stations..."
"April 26, 2013","This is a great app for your tablet.It plays music and there is few commercials or breaks. This is something you should get to listen to music. You can type up any type of music, song, or artist you like and it will bring it up. I recommend this for everyone. :)"
"September 2, 2016","Padndora has been around forever and is a great app for streaming music."
"November 29, 2015","well it works but sometimes it freezes and wont load it has a great station search but it needs to be worked on its loading skills"
"August 24, 2015","Easy to install on our Fire HD! Would recommend to anyone looking to use the Fire stick w/ Amazon! Will have a ton of fun with Pandora on my fire stick :-)"
"March 21, 2016","Doesn't work with the new update. It won't open. I like Pandora. I just wished they fix it so it works again."
"July 15, 2016","I think it is great. Sorry I did not listen to friends that had recommended sooner."
"March 29, 2016","Awesome app. Understandable that you need to listen to sponsors for free music but they are too repetitive!"
"February 9, 2014","This app is well done with millions of stations ans songs to offer the most recent station I go to myself is the Disney's Children Radio because it Has all of my songs from Disney movies and also they have some of the songs from frozen. A MUST get app for music listeners!"
"October 5, 2016","I liked it. It was the first time. Very impressed. I'll keep it!"
"May 10, 2016","Fabulous service allowing listeners to choose what music they like and hear it on their timetable."
"August 26, 2014","I like this app, but I can't figure out how to bring up the whole album and sample all the songs like I can on my laptop. Maybe the Kindle doesn't support this feature or I haven't figured how to use the feature yet. LOVE using it."
"December 18, 2015","This is the best site for music I love that I can listen to the music I prefer without having to sit through some horrible tunes."
"April 30, 2016","It's a pleasure to have such good company of great songs with ability to choose what you enjoy most."
"April 4, 2015","5 dollars makes a difference with the adds but not much, you can only skip so many times before they lock you in =/ So just switch back and forth stations and you’ll enjoy unlimited skips"
"October 17, 2016","Love it. Hate commercials. But I am cheap, so I deserve them!"
"August 3, 2015","The current version of Pandora keeps arbitrarily turning itself on. It has become so annoying that I have deleted the app after previously enjoying it for years."
"March 27, 2016","Best music app ever created😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊 People who haven't downloaded this app need to immediately"
"January 12, 2017","The computer version works well. Echo, so so."
"August 30, 2017","I can enjoy quality music of my own selection."
"September 5, 2017","They do a great job except for the commercials"
"December 30, 2016","The best way to listen to the music you select"
"February 5, 2017","So much to choose from. Something for everyone"
"January 13, 2017","Five stars says it all........And, I mean all."
"December 29, 2013","Cannot comment because I have no Idea what Pandora is or does...I was trying to get info. on it when it jumped onto my list?? How do I find info or dump it???"
"June 7, 2016","Haven't used it much yet. My daughter loves pandora on her device. Hoping to use it soon."
"May 10, 2015","Pandora is totally awesome. It rocks and you get to listen to what ever music you want, you also get to create your own station. encourage anyone and everyone to get this app!!!!!"
"February 16, 2016","I listen regularly. I listen to Pandora more than I do old style radio. It responds to my listening interests."
"November 23, 2015","Plays well"
"October 2, 2016","Because I can listen and enjoy the memories the station envocks."
"June 16, 2015","We have no cable so we have Pandora and Netflix instead. I love the way they add music similar to my picks to make a seamless program. Good choice for music lovers."
"April 27, 2014","In my limited consideration I find Pandora to be an excellent source of pop music. Like everyone else, commercials are becoming common in free Pandora. Still, I have enjoyed Pandora for many years and appreciate how they figure what music suits my taste."
"December 3, 2015","Love it, love the simplicity of Pandora. And thanks for the little perks every now and then, i.e free hour for watching a 15 sec add."
"October 1, 2014","This is great for anybody who likes music which I like to listen to but it only gives you so much free time a month for you to listen to but I do not like listening to music all the time so I already took it off of my device"
"October 7, 2015","love choice of music and you cannot beat ""free"". The only downside is the fidelity is not too great. Sirius was no better and they charge."
"January 10, 2014","It is a excellent relaxation experience listening to the music(classical) with random selections. What's the possibility of give listener a little more control? For instance, a particular composer? time period of the music? Anyway, I enjoy its services and it's free!"
"September 1, 2016","I love how when you turn off your music keeps playing taking no battery"
"June 6, 2016","Good App. Pretty happy. Wish it was more flexible as to specific artists I want to line up."
"January 2, 2014","Stream through my Kindle Fire while waiting at airport or having lunch in company lunchroom. Only have problems if wifi connection is lousy..."
"September 1, 2014","I have only been using the application for a few days, but so far I am impressed. The ability to create a ""radio station"" based on a particular artist is very intuitive, and the lyrics and notes are a interesting addition."
"June 11, 2012","What could be better than my own personal radio station? Now I can listen to country, rap , R& B, etc. when I want. I happened to to like that it plays similar new songs to the ones I like.So I am not just hearing the same songs that I like but up and coming artsists in the same genre. Very few commericials but, no tacky Djs. Pretty great. I can even stream over my blue ray."
"December 18, 2016","This is a good radio station. I like it a lot."
"August 10, 2016","I'm still having problem getting other music. The web need to be simplified."
"November 10, 2015","Pandora is so nice to use because I can take the Kindle that I use to listen from room to room. It has a great variety of music also."
"April 5, 2014","It's great to be able to pick out artists that I enjoy hearing and also some that I'm not as familiar with. But sometimes you choose too many artists that I have not chosen and play them back to back. I'd rather you intersperse the new artists less frequently."
"November 23, 2015","I love Pandora. It's a great option when you don't really want to think about what to listen to but want to listen to some great music."
"March 24, 2017","wish they had more of the artist chosen but it is nice to hear others of similar style"
"December 8, 2016","good for my parents to use on the fire tablet but thats it"
"June 29, 2015","I am so glad we have Pandora. I read bios of my favorite music. I can listen to what I want and buy on the spot. I can listen to Pandora on my phone. I Love Pandora"
"February 7, 2017","I have enjoyed Pandora on my IPad for about 5 years. Love that you can pick your own music, pick different artists or genre and play it on shuffle. Now that I have the echo I can listen to it on that, and the best part, it is free."
"January 17, 2014","this app doesn't disappoint--each song builds on other selections and exposure to artists that are not normally always heard. I've built up my music by having Pandora and I love being able to hear different genre's that I normally would not have the opportunity to listen to."
"November 24, 2014","Love the music choosing ability but not happy with the continuous popup adds. Way more adds then reasonable to expect. Refuse to fall for the passive aggressive method of having to pay monthly fees to avoid them."
"July 26, 2016","I was thanked politely for downloading it and refuse admission at registration."
"August 16, 2015","Its hard to choose which music i want to listen to because they really are all so great. love to listen at night before bed. Thanks for making it available!"
"April 15, 2014","At first, I thought Pandora was okay, pretty good music, infrequent, brief commercials, and free. Then I started to work on it, adding artists until I have the most amazingly eclectic mix of country rock, blues, jazz, Grateful Dead, Beach Boys, and it's still free. Only thing, once in a while, I'll get some schwilly Christmas song dropped in - yo9u have to be sure to exercise the thumbs down if you don't like something. For me, Pandora is just the best!"
"February 21, 2016","Wow!! what a media product. Works fantastic on my Amazon Echo and my Amazon Fire. Love my Pandora Sistar radio!"
"May 24, 2017","Pandora has all the great music"
"October 15, 2017","Great selection of all my likes"
"November 28, 2014","best radio out there even with the commercials its ok its free. the setting to pick your favorite type of music its really good compared to other sites that try to find the best music depending on what you like."
"January 30, 2017","Love it and would recommend it to everyone!!!"
"December 9, 2016","Music at the tips of your finger. Can beat it"
"December 30, 2016","I love Pandora, I can hear any type of music."
"February 4, 2017","Great variety of music. Enjoyable selections."
"November 9, 2017","Love it. 5 stars."
"January 26, 2014","I really like using Pandora, especially when I don't know exactly what I want to listen to. I'm able to play the songs and styles I like, discard what I don't like or am not in the mood for. Pandora then plays songs and styles that I like, and the choice to skip or listen."
"May 22, 2014","I give Pandora a five star rating because of it offers such a wide variety of music! I actually do not mind the commercials because they are not run close together and it makes it feel like the old radio days. I would recommend Pandora to everyone!"
"December 20, 2015","When I worked as a receptionist, I would ask whoever was waiting about their favorite musicians and create a new station for them. Now that I have a kid, I use it to play lullabies most nights. It is wonderful to have constant random music that I love pop up rather than having to constantly cycle through my cds or deal with radio replays. There aren't too many commercials, and lately, the free hour of music ads have been really appreciated."
"August 15, 2016","I love that I get to hear any artist/music that I want to, when I want to."
"October 19, 2014","I suggest you get this app if your a music lover and want music fast and easy. Also pandora has new free hits like &#34;it's all about that base&#34;, &#34;black widow&#34;, and&#34;trumpets&#34;"
"December 3, 2015","have not figured out what to do with it you need more instructions detail what the app is benefits I am deleting a lot of these"
"July 24, 2016","The best radio app ever... It plays all your likes would not ever stop using it"
"February 27, 2016","PANDORA is a cool, trendy station that I enjoy very much. Pandora plays in our home on a daily basis. Fantastic."
"July 19, 2016","Think this was free. Anyway Pandora has been selecting songs and artist I like."
"January 11, 2015","Same as any Pandora app which means very good. My only complaint about the Amazon Fire TV app is that you can bookmark songs, but then there is no way to access them unlike when on the Pandora website."
"May 11, 2015","It works but when your on one channel it some time plays songs from different artists and I like the songs it plays it play the most fascinating or best song that artists sings"
"October 6, 2014","Love having access to Pandora on my Kindle Fire. I listen all the time and it works great. The sound on the Kindle is astonishingly clear and crisp. I wouldn't be without all my favorite stations. Simple and free APP."
"September 12, 2014","I love that I get to listen to any kind of music and all of my favorite artists! It's not boring like the radio station in the car that is always playing the same thing, day in and day out until another artist releases a song!"
"January 2, 2017","Couldn't sign into my account on this device"
"February 26, 2017","Love it! Works perfect with Sonos speakers!"
"December 22, 2016","I love the variety that Pandora has to offer"
"January 4, 2017","I am pleased with the good variety of music."
"June 21, 2017","not cheap enough"
"June 20, 2016","Good variety of music. Sometimes skips around and drops songs but overall pretty good"
"June 29, 2016","A GREAT WAY TOO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND OTHER ARTISTS THAT YOU MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH!"
"October 7, 2015","I hope that the paid version is better but the free version is full of loading and other errors. Certainly not convincing me to get the paid one"
"October 22, 2013","this is really a plus for me i can have pandora in one rooom and slacker radio on in another room. it depends on my busy schedule. i cant jump from beyonce to brenda russell going into the different areas of my home and thats what keeps me going. music is everything and makes my day flow."
"August 14, 2015","I love Pandora in general but wish I could add artists to a station I have set up. Now I have to create a whole new station when I want to add a new artist."
"October 12, 2017","Like"
"April 23, 2016","Pandora is so amazing you can listen to everything. Me and my dad listen to it all the time!👂👂🎶"
"December 27, 2014","Downloaded this to my Kindle Fire HDX so we could have some back ground holiday music when we were having Xmas morning breakfast. Worked well, easy to find some Holiday Music Channels....what can I say."
"March 31, 2017","I use pandora alot"
"November 30, 2016","Wish I could listen commercial free for no cost."
"November 25, 2016","Great way to listen to music on my kindle fire!😊"
"February 4, 2016","I just love it everything I want to here I fine it here my wife enjoy it to if you don't have it put it on your list"
"February 4, 2016","Pandora is an amazing app for music. Stations play the music I enjoy and introduce me to artists I haven't heard of."
"December 7, 2016","The mobile app is easy and the music isn't bad"
"June 14, 2017","Love my george strait station"
"May 3, 2017","I enjoy listening to Pandora."
"February 5, 2017","I rarely listen to live stations anymore..."
"February 5, 2017","love it play my favorite songs all the time"
"August 10, 2017","the very best music i have ever experienced"
"February 15, 2017","Arrived on time and performs as advertised."
"January 10, 2017","Great. You can find all the songs you like"
"February 9, 2017","I'd give a 5 but the commercials are a pain"
"January 31, 2017","Good for listening to my kind of old school"
"January 5, 2017","enjoy listening to the music, great variety"
"January 20, 2017","It is so great to listen to music you love."
"April 20, 2016","I put on Rockabye for my grandson to help him sleep. .He loves this channel and so do I!! Thank you"
"November 11, 2016","spotify is way better for daily use less commercials"
"September 30, 2014","I like this app but there is one negative about this in some of the song they don't cut out the bad words and I let the kids listen to and dance with and I don't aloud the kids around anything or person that use bad words"
"September 11, 2016","Great! Except on a Blackberry device, all apps suck on a BB device"
"August 2, 2016","I love being able to hear the radio about anywhere. Love my country music."
"August 21, 2014","I got this spp back in the days of the first iPhone, now it really stinks. In order to get the service I got for free, it now costs 5 dollars a month or put up with ads thst are worse than commercial tv when infomercials are on."
"December 6, 2012","Pandora meet all my simple requirements for music, far beyond that of commercial radio..Since my taste is classical and jazz, i have more than enough choices,.i really don't mind the ads, They are at least silent,small and non intrusive and pays the bills to enable this senior to enjoy good music during my computer work as well on my tablet..."
"June 28, 2013","Gotta love Pandora. I enjoy listening to music that suits my likes and plays more of what you wan to hear. Of course, the ads do get annoying as well as it stopping the music to ask you if you are still listening. However, when its free, I guess you have to accept some bit of annoyances. Overall, a great app."
"September 10, 2016","Love Pandora keeps me motivated while working out and makes it fun"
"July 22, 2015","I like Pandora radio. It has a lot of pop-ups and always ask you to subscribe. It also just stops playing for some reason. I like it better than Iheart though."
"December 9, 2016","works well and pandora rocks so 5 stars it is"
"March 3, 2016","I give Pandora 5 stars but you guys need to get involved with the independent artists and the unsigned artist"
"February 9, 2013","Pandora is my ""go to"" music app on my tablet when I am connected to a wireless signal. I love that I can rate music with thumbs up / thumbs down and pandora will play more or less music according to what I have liked/not liked. Great way to discover new tunes. Also lets you view lyrics to some songs and artist biographies."
"March 15, 2013","Pandora is AWESOME! I love the selections of music. I am old school and I love listening to my oldie favorites. I also listen to it at the elementary school I work at during the week. The children work so great to the calming instrumental music. Thank you."
"January 21, 2014","Well I KEPT trying to sign in it didn't let me but I did everything correctly maybe it's because I'm only 8 but I love music.I don't know if your a little young I think you need to lie about your year because it didn't let me but I'm gonna try to lie about my birth year."
"February 5, 2016","I can listen to all my favorite music and have been able to enjoy listening to music for the first time in 50 years"
"September 4, 2016","Enjoy using Pandora when I do my walk and going on trips in my car."
"September 21, 2016","Number of adds has gone way up. To force you to buy their site."
"January 19, 2014","I love Pandora! The music selections are great & there's a huge array of musicians. Commercial I don't like so much but are deff necessary because it's free so advertising is a no brainer."
"August 7, 2015","This app. use to be awesome but now all it dose is skill songs and tell me it can not find anymore for all the stations. I'm very disappointed right now. D:"

"August 13, 2017","Love the music"
"July 29, 2017","Excellent jazz"
"December 2, 2016","I just subscribed but so far I really like it!"
"December 12, 2015","Whenever I press follow it won't let me follow no more please fix it. I still love Pandora it just won't let me follow no more."
"January 7, 2016","I really like it because I really like music and stuff, and I can look up the lyrics on some of my favorite songs. I also don't like it because sometimes I use up all my skips on one station, and then I go to a different station and use up ONE SKIP, and then it says I used up all my skips. Um, like, what?!😕😑😒"
"May 24, 2016","I love it. Except sometimes it cuts off the end of the song. And it skips to the next one."
"November 20, 2014","My whole family loves listening to Pandora! It is much better than the radio because we can select what we want to listen to! It has even replaced all our MP3 players! Way to go Pandora, keep up the good work!"
"August 27, 2015","It is the best of all worlds. I am very happy with this amazing choice of all my favorites and more. I am meeting so many new artists. I am blessed."

"February 16, 2014","I have many music channels and even my own IPod. After a while, they seem to have repeats and I am easily bored. With all the music in this world, I don't want repeats. If one comes on Pandora, I just skip it, unless I have liked it and wont mind hearing it again."
"November 28, 2013","The app downloaded, and then put the blue-background logo page on the screen. then NOTHING else. No login, no buttons, no stream, no music. No instructions, no info on ""System requirements"", no Help."
"July 10, 2016","I love this product. It is easy to use and doesn't stop as suddenly as YouTube."
"October 31, 2016","Good selection of the genre or artist that I request."
"September 20, 2016","Pandora is always a great app to use for music. It allows you to create your own music stations as well as listening to ones that are pre- defined. I have the Pandora One, which then means that I have no ads popping up to worry about for just a small fee of $2.99 per month."
"August 25, 2016","Who doesn't love Pandora! This ap has the best features of the Pandora web and includes come great social media interaction. I listen to radio quite often and the ability to pick an artist, hear music by that artist and discover other artists similar to that artist is quite incredible."
"April 19, 2016","I like it a lot. Will have to get commercial free someday. For now, working in the yard, it's fine"
"February 17, 2016","I like that Pandora knows exactly what kind of music I listen to and tells me about other artists I might like."
"December 23, 2013","If there was a zero i would use it, all i wanted was to listen to my favorite songs and what it gave me wa a blue screen with the logo on it. If you really want a good Internet radio then purchase songza alot easier to use and has all of the new hit songs or.oldie goldies."
"February 8, 2014","Pandora is a great way to listen to your favorite music and is very easy to use. I like when you're listening to your favorite song but you have to go you can bookmark it,come back,and listen to the exact song you with. In other words LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!"
"January 16, 2013","I've gotten to where I really enjoy listening to music again. A friend suggested I check out Pandora, and I have not been disappointed."

"February 11, 2016","This app is so awesome I can read and listen to music at the same time and all the music is really high quality!"
"March 26, 2015","After two songs on any channel the whole thing freezes and kicks you out of the app and when you try to sign back in it takes for ever it's not worth the zero dollars you spent for it"
"May 7, 2015","I love this app listen music any where any time once connected to the internet. And i mean all type of music you just search for the type u want to hear.  Great job"
"July 14, 2016","Great music application. Worth getting the paid version to avoid commercials."
"August 22, 2016","Go to sleep each night listening to Pandora's ""Spa"" station."
"August 15, 2015","Nothing is perfect but Pandora comes real close. Been with them quite awhile and only complaint is they tend to cut off long jams, not good programmers!"
"February 16, 2016","When Pandora gives me unlimited skips with no commercials, then and only then would it be worth paying for it."
"August 28, 2015","This app is simply perfect. Why? They play any song, hardly any bugs, free, Can turn off cursing, did I mention it's FREE? F-R-E-E. FREE! Get it now!"
"February 16, 2016","Was able to enjoy a mixture of music & even a Christmas song came on, which was nice for Valentine's Day...lol"
"March 25, 2014","I Love Pandora! It allows me to listen to all different genres of music...depending on what mood I'm in! I like the subscribed version better though....otherwise you have to deal with time-outs every hour and some really not family-appropriate commercials!"

"January 24, 2016","I love having this app on my phone. Sometimes as in Tennessee - cut off for a few sec but other than that I love it"
"April 28, 2016","Husband and I enjoy the music found on Pandora. Wish our car was able to get it on the radio."
"June 26, 2014","Pandora is great, the sound quality is good and they have a really awesome musical library. There is something for every musical taste. The only thing I dislike is that you can only skip forward so many songs per hour unless you upgrade."
"January 30, 2014","I absolutely love Pandora, you can choose any style of music you'd like. There is something that bothers me though, every now and then the app will freeze causing me to uninstall and reinstall till it works. It's a free well known app so definitely recommend.! Enjoy"
"July 19, 2016","It remembers all my favorite songs for the gym. Thumbprint radio is awesome"
"January 30, 2014","I always have Pandora on while cleaning or cooking, love it. The only thing I find annoying is when I type in a song and they don't play it! In the past that was the first song played then songs similar would play, not now, not that big of a deal but kinda annoying."
"October 16, 2013","I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire and was most impressed. I opened the app and started listening to music but had never did anything else while listening to music. So I opened my Ebay app and did some shopping while listening to music that I like on Pandora...totally fabulous!!"
"December 13, 2013","I have enjoyed Pandora on my website for years. Now I have a new tablet and added Pandora to it like an old friend. Pandora is efficient, user-friendly, offering all the mixed-styles of music I enjoy. It's an app that does what you want, when you want it, Thanks, Pandora."
"September 30, 2015","I don't like the fact that you have to pay to be able to skip songs. I'd rather go on YouTube and use the Autoplay function. SMH. >.>"
"December 18, 2016","Great app.what can you say . It plays music."
"June 26, 2016","Pandora provides a great mix of music and unobtrusive ads with the free version."
"October 3, 2012","I have Pandora on my Kindle Fire HD and on my Roku. I love to listen to the radio while I read on the Kindle. Pandora has all my favorite music and their ""add-ons"" are usually very good. I don't have the paid version, but the commercials don't bother me. They are short and don't come too often. Pandora is so much better than buying a bunch of music."
"November 8, 2015","Pandora is something I listen to often at home, but I don't have it in my car (older model), so this is a nice feature for my phone."
"June 27, 2015","Pandora One is the best subscription ever! For so little every month you get NO commercials and being able to switch up between stations is perfect for car rides."
"May 16, 2013","I love Pandora and I use it on my laptop, iPad, and Samsung note 2 phone. Downloaded on the new Kindle, and not really impressed with the speakers in the back and facing away from me. muffs the sound. I cannot blue tooth the Kindle, it just will not find my speaker and I have tried everything to get to work.  Got the new Kindle Fire HD today. Download Pandora but cannot blue tooth the Kindle to my Jabra Speaker. If I am unable to use blood tooth, I doubt it worth keeping the Kindle. Betty"
"December 10, 2014","Just started to use Pandora. So far the selection of artists and types of music is very impressive. Quality of downloaded music is impressive. Maybe after a few more uses I can jump this to a 5 star."
"April 28, 2014","Pandas are adorable. Yes I know this is supposed to be about Pandora but it auto corrected to panda and know I'm writing about pandas. But I'm no expert on pandas so all I have to say for them is that they are adorabru and red pandas are even cuter"
"April 7, 2017","I found all my old music."
"January 7, 2013","I like having this download because thereare so any option of simularmusic to listen to. The only thing I dont really like which Im on is pnly listening to one artist at a time instead of skipping from Artist to Artist. This is why I download and pay for specific songs and not use this until Im tired of listenting to th same songs."
"January 10, 2017","Who doesn't like to listen to music????"
"August 3, 2017","Love creating my own channels of music!"

"January 29, 2017","I can listen to all my favorite artists"
"December 3, 2013","They really need to work on this app. For the most part I love it. Then we have those days when it gets stuck buffering for hours. Work out the last remaining gliches and I would give it the 5th star."
"September 8, 2017","Great music"
"August 18, 2017","Three stars"
"May 23, 2017","Great music"
"July 18, 2017","Great music"
"August 30, 2013","I can customize the music I want to listen!! The ads on the free version is on the side and doesn't disturb too much, but it does come to a stop after a while. Will be getting the paid version so i can get music all the time."
"September 2, 2016","Love it that I can make my own station of songs I love to here.."
"October 25, 2013","My sister and niece told me about Pandora and showed me how to get it and use it. I love it because a person can select the station that you want and the music that you like and it is just that easy. I love it."
"July 29, 2016","Pandora timed out and I can not get back up and running.any suggestions."
"June 8, 2013","The program has a great interface and a good selection of music. It is easy to find the artist or style of music you want to hear. The pop ups, while annoying, are minimal. The fact that I can close my Kindle Fire and still hear the music, or work on other programs and still listen, are also great features."
"January 24, 2016","Works well but I question whatever algorithm they are using to select the music that plays on a particular station"
"September 4, 2013","I downloaded this thinking that it would allow me to listen to music with ease. It has a decent design, but the only thing I was listening to was advertisements. It's much easier just to use a site like [...] to download the songs for free and have a full library of MUSIC, not advertisements."
"September 6, 2016","use Pandora on my phone while doing my morning walk. I love it!"
"August 6, 2016","Love the freedom of picking my own music to make my own radio stations"

"January 19, 2016","NO SPEAKERS AT MY DESK AND I LOVE TO WORK TO MUSIC - CAN PLUG IN MY TABLET AND LISTEN TO MY FAVORITE GENRES ALL DAY"
"September 14, 2013","It's hard not to like a radio station that plays all your favorites for free with very limited commercial s. We listen to the pay to listen station at work with no commercials all day. I know they have to make money but I wish they would not allow the car commercials with the annoying kids."
"August 21, 2015","IT'S ok but I think that AccuRadio is better, but that's just me !!!! I'm an old school, slow jams person when I'm not listening to GOSPIL ....."
"May 16, 2015","After a while it signed me out saying that there were some technical difficulties. Then when I tried to sign up again it said it was also have some technical difficulties"

"January 24, 2017","its great has all the great music....."
"July 26, 2014","I could of given it more stars but it would not allow me to download their app. Every time i tried Pandora would not recognize either or both my e-mail or password,so I had to move on and downloaded another app. instead"
"December 30, 2013","I think that this app is probably the best music app you can get. Free music, but you dont get to choose what song you listen to. But it will give you the songs that are related to it. It also gives you the best quality you can get. Awesome and highly recommended by me."
"October 24, 2015","I already have an account for this service also and I like the fact that I can receive the music I like based on my movie preferences."
"April 12, 2014","I'm a paying subscriber to Pandora, so I had to have this app. Downloaded quickly, and, after opening the app, enables you to sign into your Pandora account. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Kindle HD's speakers. Pandora sounds great!"

"December 11, 2015","One of my favorite places to turn to when the music on the radio gets boring or there is nothing but holiday music playing."
"December 29, 2013","I know Pandora needs to sell advertising but I've stopped using Pandora until the Deer Hunter game stops being advertised. I have no desire to sit through an advertisment advocating violence against animals for fun. If they have to do that they should shut down instead."
"January 7, 2017","love it"
"May 19, 2016","I love the selection of music! It's probably me but I have a little problem nevagating."
"September 8, 2015","I've tried several music apps and Pandora has consistently been my favorite! I do enjoy the upgrade to Pandora One so there are no commercials."
"March 27, 2013","I love this app. I don't mind the commercials its not that bad.I have about fifty stations and I can listen to all my favorite artist and similar artists. The occasional glitch isn't that bad. I don't mind so much. If stops on a song I like I have multiple stations of them so I can listen to them again later. No biggy."
"December 14, 2015","What's not to love about Pandora? It is what you want it to be. The ads don't bother me they are so few and far between."
"July 26, 2016","It's great"
"December 26, 2014","I really like this. It came with the Challel Master DVR and that got me connected. I tried it on my computer where I pick the songs. Now I added it to my Fire and that gives me some mobility. Bobbj"
"March 3, 2013","I found pandora years ago with some coworkers who used it. I love the fact you can create stations that play the similar kinds of music. It doesn't always get it right if you pick more obscure music, but anything mainstream it picks simiar music. I introduced my wife first to it a year ago and she uses it all the time now."
"February 28, 2014","Great to listen to the music that I love. I live in a rural area the radio does not come in very well at. Playing the music on my kindle HDx is great as I can use ear plugs as well as listen to it out loud. Don't know how long my battery will last though."
"December 18, 2016","Just wish there was no commercials. :)"
"March 2, 2016","I love to listen to Pandora it's my favorite companion in my sewing room outside of my stass of fabric😉"
"August 2, 2014","I love this app. It is awesome for when your at home and have nothing better to do. I like listening to it while doing homework. I never have time to constantly update my opossum with new songs so Pandora is a nice alternative."
"August 18, 2016","one of the best things to happen to music and radio, Just love it."

"April 2, 2016","I love having options and Pandora has given me that for many years. A must have for music lovers!"
"September 17, 2016","Great on a PC, but the sound on a tablet needs improvement."

"January 22, 2015","If you cannot find the music that you love on Pandora in all probability it does not exist. This is a wonderful service that offers a variety of creative ways to use it, Highly recommended."
"December 8, 2016","Fun app, very easy to use, finds music I've never heard before just by the way it's arranged. Allows you to setup playlists and allows you to skip songs a limited amount of times per playlists per day. Free version has lots of commercials."
"November 24, 2013","I love listening to Pandora. It plays all my favorite songs and the new update is so nice, expect that the sleep timer is gone. I used it for weeks and then i updated it and it was gone. :( . Please bring it back on the kindle. (Besides that everything else is fantabulous!!)"
"April 11, 2015","I love having access to my favorite music right on my kindle. Pandora is with me now on my laptop and kind and my 'stations' were right at my fingertips as soon as I logged in."

"October 16, 2013","It's wonderful to chose any type music, or artist and have that type of music play continuously. It's easy to change to other artists/ music at will. We have a Sonos system and use Pandora every day. And no ads!!! That's great! I can't stand to listen to regular radio anymore!"

"August 12, 2013","This app brings in Pandora radio to my Kindle. I also use Pandora on my laptop. Pandora is great. It allows me flexibility to listen to the music that I like, depending upon my mood. I can be pretty scattered at times so it is also good that I can switch genres whenever I want without a hassle."
"October 6, 2016","Are you still listening is an excuse to play an ad...."
"October 11, 2014","I love Pandora. I like how it plays songs that are similar to the songs i like. I dont even mind the ads because they arent very often. I totaly recomend this over iheartradio because Pandora has many more skips."

"November 13, 2014","I just heard about Pandora and have been using it non stop. I love it, it's addicting. I have to force myself to stop. The music is endless. I found a timeless use for my Kindle besides books and internet."
"January 8, 2013","Well, what to say about pandora. It's a radio system where you can choose the type of music you wish to listen to! (And yes you can have multiple lists an it does shuffle the lists if you would like.) Anything from Pop to traditional Celtic! Of course you have the occasional ad but I love the varieties offered."
"August 5, 2016","use it in the shower the best be be be be be be be be be be be be be"

"June 3, 2015","Love it on the Kindle Fire HD 7. It works smoothly and your Kindle is louder than your iPhone. I love putting Pandora on my Kindle when I am in the kitchen cooking."
"December 13, 2016","There's nothing better and it's free!!"
"March 28, 2016","Any music you want to listen to right at your fingertips… Quality sound and overall great product"
"June 9, 2016","The only problem is the stinking commercials. Other than that I like the program."
"March 27, 2016","Well it's Pandora. Works with many devices, always the music you create for a personal music experience."
"December 31, 2012","I have had Pandora for about 4 years on my Internet Radio, Roku box & now on my Kindle. I am still amazed at the flexibility of Pandora, by simply using the feedback system of ""Like or Dislike"" I have music that is truly my own. I have access to many radio stations through my Roku box but Pandora is always my first choice."
"November 2, 2014","I really enjoy listening to my music choices through my Kindle. My music taste differs from that off spouse and that is putting it mildly. As long as I don't sing along it is all good when I use my ear buds."
"January 13, 2016","I Love Pandora, it has always been a fan and the app works great. I use this everyday to stream my favorite music!"
"December 9, 2013","Excellent so far, we are enjoying it. We are using it to build a Christian Christmas station, and while it occasionally throws in an unusual offering, most tracks are right on target. Our family is having fun with it, and the commercials aren't too frequent or annoying."
"August 10, 2014","To many adds I have deleted and waited for an update that would down grade the adds to ever so often I have muve music on my phone and I can download free music anytime with no adds so I like Pandora but to many friken adds."
"January 20, 2014","I really like the Pandora player. The channels are very good at finding similar bands to the one you are searching for and plays a nice selection of music. My only real complaint is the very limited number of skips that you get for the day even if you subscribe."
"August 21, 2016","It is good but it's like radio stations almost Spotify is better"
"June 8, 2016","Interactive app. It learns as you go. In time you have a station for every mood."
"March 29, 2017","To many ads and spooling I'm sticking with Spotify free that has very few ads and no spooling"
"March 22, 2013","They make it how you have to pay, going str8t To I Heart Radio, making you have to pay for OLD SONGS that they keep repeating please, that's why you don't hear about them anymore. I don't understand people buying those ad free the premium? Doesn't make sense half of the songs i heard are in my car on a CD?!! Useless!"
"August 2, 2017","Pretty good music app."
"December 29, 2013","The music plays even if I'm not in the app itself, which is great. But it's a pain to have to go back to the app to pause the song playing. But other than that, no problems besides that sometimes Pandora can't load all the way so it makes itself freeze for some reason"
"January 31, 2017","Excellent source of media and music."
"December 24, 2016","Ads get in the way but for free good"
"January 21, 2017","don't mind the ads - love the music!"
"February 2, 2017","Pandora gets me through my work day."
"September 11, 2016","Pandora is wonderful. Really works well on the Amazon Echo."
"April 16, 2014","I love Pandora, because I can choose a song, artist, style of music and Pandora gives back a nonstop roller coaster of musical surprises. I use it on my phone, television, computer and Kindle. Pandora is one of my all time favorite applications."
"June 24, 2016","comedy channels rock i listen every night to fall a sleep to pandora is great"
"September 9, 2015","its a lot of musical fun and I love listening to it because it's all free and you can thumbs up and down if you like or don't like the song :D"
"January 23, 2014","I used to listen to Pandora on my laptop but it never worked that well because my laptop has issues. Now I listen to Pandora on my Kindle Fire and I love it. I like to listen to it when I'm in the kitchen cooking and I can listen to anything O'm in the mood for!"
"January 21, 2017","Always a quality app to have on any phone"
"March 25, 2013","I really love the variety of music. I can surf the net on my android tablet while I listen to music on Pandora. It's amazing! lol"
"January 13, 2013","Really like having only the music I listen to available and the suggested music, great! Wish this technology was available years ago"
"March 11, 2016","Can't find many of the songs I want to hear and it plays songs IT thinks are similar to what I want."
"December 9, 2016","Pandora rocks!!! I'd give it 10 stars."
"January 29, 2013","If Pandora doesn't ruin itself by including too many commercials, it will remain one of the most important items in my life. I love having Pandora. And I know I have purchased a lot more music since I started listening to Pandora. Yet, so much for free. This program is an essential for anyone who loves to listen to music."
"March 28, 2014","Nearly Free, Great music. Perfect in Almost every respect eve on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9""... I just wish I could pay as I go instead of the ridiculously low price of (I think only) of $99.00/year... But I live on my retirement SSI and $100.00 all at once is more than I can handle... So I feel slightly guilty listening... just slightly even though the commercial breaks are to my taste better than the usual ones... No Fund Drives either unlike the ""Commercial"" Stations or Public Radio that always hit between SSI checks Great feature would be a senior account, However i can see no way to void the inevitable fraud that is going to appear... Perhaps a select few stations, Classical and perhaps easy listening...  R K. Johnson Sr.  Robert K. Johnson Sr"
"January 17, 2016","It is absolutely amazing. I can rate the music I listen to and the music played is based accordingly. Fantastic!"
"September 3, 2016","Have used it for many years on other devices... always good."
"December 7, 2013","I love the app. It's a great music app that learn your music. But the new update insiders. I can't push play to the music. It just didn't play. So until they fix that I guess I can't listen to music"
"March 9, 2016","Love Pandora, I am in control of my music. Only wish that I could skip more than 6 times in a hour."
"February 27, 2017","Love the music they play. They jam!"
"February 18, 2017","just love it all oldies and goodies"
"January 14, 2017","Listen ever day. Has great stations"
"February 23, 2017","I don't remember ordering this app."
"December 29, 2016","a necessary addition to the kindle."
"January 21, 2017","Best to use in the Late Night!! 😉"
"April 14, 2015","Great music, but annoying ads unless you want to pay $4.99/month. Also, no directions, so can't figure out how to turn it off on my tablet without turning it off completely."
"June 26, 2017","Love it"
"July 25, 2017","Love it"
"August 23, 2017","Awesome"
"February 23, 2015","Went to use it and was asked A WHOLE LOT of invasive questions. Deleted it immediately."
"May 12, 2015","Never tried it before now. I was surprised that it did have some of the more obscure bands that I'm interested in. Still in the testing phase but so far I'm pleased."
"January 14, 2017","Love, love, love my Pandora. Yes, I'm too cheap to pay for it, so I have to suffer commercials from time to time. The subscription is not bad though. I think it's around $5 (at least it used to be). I love having this on my Kindle. I can play it while I'm reading my online books. I also frequently listen to it as go to bed. It has a sleep timer which will shut it off so it doesn't play all night."
"September 1, 2013","I love this app! Listen to your fave artist! It has pop, rock, rap, country, you name it! You can play games at the same time too. Play anything while listening to your tunes. Dance and sing to any artist on the planet!"
"August 12, 2015","I L O V E Pandora! Just learned about it from a family member and have been listening to it since. If you love music you will reallt enjoy Pandora."
"February 6, 2014","Love it, love it, love it! Create your own stations based your various likes/moods, or use Pandora's stations and fine tune them. Bluetooth in the car and works with your phone (does take a lot of data). A couple bucks per month takes away the commercials."
"December 18, 2016","Love it, great way to enjoy music!!"
"February 1, 2016","I use this free app for doing the treadmill even though it has ads those do not interrupt the music usually."
"September 22, 2016","Favorite way to stream music. Works on multiple devices"
"December 14, 2016","i like some of the music you ask for"
"September 26, 2016","I'm new to Pandora,WOW,to bad I waited so long.Love it"
"May 22, 2016","A great way to hear a lot of great music - some you know, some new based on tastes."
"September 17, 2016","Love the app. Hate all the ads, but hey, it is free....."
"July 22, 2016","I love using Pandora. Has an excellent variety of free entertainment."
"August 15, 2015","Put a virus on my kindle and asking to download sex things I don't want nor need. It was nice but I will stick to I heart at least I know I'm safe"
"February 3, 2016","I love it but for some reason on my kindle it skips the entire song now and I can't listen to music anymore"
"March 17, 2014","Ok so I think this all is like sooooo awesome but what it realy needs is some bass / terb positions cause on some of these songs I am all like this would sound so cool with the bass up or the terb up so I think it would make an already cool app cooler"
"October 12, 2014","I think this is wonderful however I'm not clear on how to use it or how to make and select my own music . Since it's free you can't beat it and I'm sure most people will be able to figure out how it all works."
"June 5, 2016","Love the variety"
"February 16, 2016","I LOVE LOVE Pandora!!! I can't get radio where I live so I rely on P andora for my everyday background."
"December 3, 2015","Listening to Internet radio is so convenient and enjoyable. And you can customize it to your personal listening pleasure."
"October 2, 2015","Expect to encounter problems with selection and playing those selections. Sometimes works well and sometimes not. Can be frustrating !!"
"March 18, 2016","this is like my fav music app great if you don't have a radio plays all your fav songs. # awesome"
"February 16, 2016","I have only recently been introduced to Pandora and already am a big fan. Station creation is the best!"
"July 13, 2015","Pandora lets me listen to my all-time favourite songs and artists like Bruno Mars and Taylor Swift. Five out of five from me. I've never had any problems"
"July 23, 2017","Pandora is the best!"
"September 1, 2017","Always enjoy Pandora"
"July 18, 2017","I really enjoy it!!!"
"January 30, 2017","The App In Use The Most, Top Notch"
"January 8, 2017","Really a special treat at ANY time"
"January 7, 2017","Fantastic for our home and office!"
"January 11, 2017","Most of my listening is on PANDORA"
"December 29, 2016","Great as long as your OK with ads."
"January 23, 2017","I dig it.......thx for being free."
"December 28, 2016","Best way to relax & fuggetaboutit!"
"January 10, 2017","Doesnt play music you want to hear"
"January 29, 2017","Love it ! I figured this out fast."
"December 28, 2016","pandora has a good vriety of music"
"February 2, 2017","Love listening to the music I like"
"December 29, 2016","Pandora always plays the best hits"
"August 31, 2015","Just got the app for Pandora -Wow!!!Been in the darkness And now I see the light !Constant non stop music if all ur favorite tunes !AWESOME 😍"
"December 15, 2016","Pandora is excellent for my needs!!"
"May 6, 2016","It knows what I like and waking up to my favorite stuff each morning is nice, too. . ."
"March 15, 2015","When I checked my kindle to see if it had a viruse. It found one and it was Pandora. It labeled it as a tracking app and I'll miss it because I loved but I can't have it anymore."
"July 17, 2016","I use pandora every day in my car and created a bunch of different stations and customized them to my favorite bands and songs. I love thumbprint radio. It plays all my favorites across all the genres I listen to."
"January 7, 2015","I listen to pandora everyday. I love it"
"May 1, 2016","I have issues with it freezing up at times. I have reported it. Otherwise it's great."
"September 27, 2016","Its Great that I never have to skip over any songs!!!"
"October 3, 2015","I play this almost all the time when I am on the computer, love being able to choose the genre of music, and change it when I want to."
"June 21, 2016","Love Pandora. Great music listed with a variety to fit everyone's interest."
"May 17, 2016","Think of it as a radio where you can tell the station what you want to listen to..."
"December 12, 2016","they play the best listening music."
"August 28, 2015","Love the variety of music I can choose from on Pandora. I can't find the music I enjoy on regular radio so Pandora is an answer to my prayers."
"February 18, 2013","This app is awesome .but if you only like a certain kind of song or songs this app is not for you.to get songs you'll probably like put in a band or person you most like the most. If you are getting this for your kid be warned some of the songs aren't in clean version so they will cuss.this app works great on kindle. :)"
"June 5, 2014","I love listening to Pandora and use it everyday, especially during my commute to and from work. I love that I can change the genre of my music. I have not upgraded to the ad free yet, but would not mind having it without commercials."
"October 25, 2016","Would not down load into my NEW 8"" HD Fire"
"September 28, 2012","I have no idea why everyone doesn't use this. It's an amazing way to create your own radio station. Far fewer commercials that traditional radio. You also get mostly the artists you ask for, but they will also throw in new stuff you've never heard before. I also like hearing some older songs that aren't played on the radio very often anymore."
"December 30, 2012","In my opinion this product beats all. I like the fact that I can select a band that I like, to create a station. Once it is started only bands that are in a similar genre are played. To be fair, the only other one I have tried was Slacker, and that was before I found Pandora. Once I found it I didn't need to look anywhere else."
"July 20, 2015","It's Pandora. What else can I say."
"May 26, 2017","This app is a joke compared to the iPhone version. Very little functionality is offered compared to iPhone (making playlists, streaming select songs, etc) This is the same as the current iPad app, which also lacks the new features."
"August 16, 2017","It's great for all."
"September 1, 2017","You need more stars"
"January 21, 2017","Works well with Alexa. Thank you."
"January 30, 2017","I listen to Pandora all the time."
"January 5, 2017","Happy with the music and artists."
"December 25, 2016","Useful can always find good tunes"
"December 25, 2016","Love every minute every second!!!"
"June 13, 2017","Great"
"March 15, 2013","I use Pandora on a few of my devices. I really like to use it when we have functions. The continous music with a commercial advertisement is still better than FM Radio in my local area. I can not upgrade app to latest upgrade for some strange reason."
"March 18, 2015","I think Pandora is a great app! Pandora has all the music you would want but, there is no playlists or personal music. In spotify you can create radio channels, you get recommended music, you can go to different genres of music and find specific music that you would enjoy. You can also save music to your own playlists and listen to it anywhere for free with no internet!"
"October 13, 2015","Love the accessibility of so many of my favorite artists ! And to be introduced to some of their not so chart busting songs ,also ."
"January 17, 2013","enjoy completely listing to all the songs that I have chosen, and the ease with which I am able to find and select my choices."
"August 30, 2013","I like being able to tailor my music to my needs. I can hear tunes that I have not purchased, and if I do want to purchase them, I can. I can also learn about the artist. it's all I need."
"March 18, 2014","It was recommended by a friend. I like to be able to mix/shuffle the stations in my list. Would like to be able to listen to just one artist, but just haven't taken the time to sign up for the next level of Pandora. Thanks for a great music site."
"July 19, 2016","I've been using Pandora for 7 months. I've tried others, but the reason I like Pandora so much is my ability to tell it what kind of music I want to listen to....Some may say another internet radio station does that....well, if they do, they are user friendly enough for me to figure it out."
"August 10, 2016","Pandora I like better than Sirius...cancelled my subscriptions."
"January 18, 2014","When you first meet Pandora, you get a light headed feeling. You think to yourself, ""Wow, finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of. You two meet frequently; multiple times a day in fact. You start dreaming of all the flexibility and new music you'd get introduced to. You mess around with different combinations of songs, artists, themes, etc, until you realize something strange is happening! You start to think the worst...is this too good to be true? Have you been taken for a ride and abandoned in some place known as the loop, where all the music you clicked ""like"" to is constantly being played, even on stations that you would not expect to hear them on? You start to panic and say, ""Well maybe the ""free"" version has limitations. So you vacillate between paying for this somewhat weak service in the hopes of strengthen it or just abandoning it all together. You take the plunge--pull out your credit card and go for broke, only to be deflated, dejected and sent into a downward spiral of self-pity and regret. Why? Why Pandora Why?"
"December 5, 2015","I enjoy all the great music and opportunity of choice.. Ilove it and I recommend it to all my friends...thanks so much!"
"July 27, 2016","Love listening to my personalized Pandora radio while on vacation."
"September 18, 2016","Love everything. Never leave without a pecan roll. 😇"
"July 31, 2014","Pandora is like the most popular radio station in the whole world and it has all of my favorite songs on the app but the only thing I don't like about Pandora is that you can't skip how many songs you want there's a limit."
"August 20, 2015","Love Pandora!! I've listened to it for past few years, and have multiple stations set up. The occasional commercials do not bother me at all."
"December 19, 2014","This is the best radio app ever! Great music, you can mix-and-match songs. The only thing is that it does not have the latest songs, a lot of the songs are the older ones but still very good!!!"
"March 18, 2016","I understand developers want money. It's business. What I want is some reasonable privacy when I run an app. I like music. There are FREE apps that do a nice job, some with too many ads but many that certainly don't need my email address or login to operate. Pandora isn't one of these. It might well be a premium music app but in terms of what it wants... it's not for me.  Slick interface that installs smoothly and runs well on my Kindle Fire HD. Fast download took forever to install. Why? TUNE IN is just as effective, annoyingly too many intrusive ads, but free and no login required."
"July 30, 2014","i love to lisen to music and pandora does the job for real i know what not in and what is because its a radio and i put on sreach station and u put todays hit music and that will keep u up with the music today just awsome"
"August 19, 2014","Love Pandora. I love all the choices of stations, artists, genres and the ability to mix and match etc. The only thing I wish I could do was listen to it in my old car, but I only have unlimited streaming at home. :("
"April 8, 2016","Music for days. Pandora has been around forever and it's my go to app for continuous music."
"November 30, 2016","Use Pandora all the time. Great app."
"February 8, 2016","From Google search, apparently Pandora is aware of bugs for Kindle, but no fix in sight. Uninstalled it."
"December 17, 2016","Do know what to say, can't get on"
"July 17, 2016","Great selection but they have started repeating songs too frequently"
"May 31, 2015","Oh I am so happy with this service. I can create my own channels and use my phone to listen in the car. I thinkit is as good or better than the paid services."
"March 27, 2014","I wanted to be able to make my own personalized music experience, but end up skipping around a bunch to get to a decent song, or just going to Youtube instead. It seems when I choose an artist for a channel, that artist gets played like once a day. Sometimes I get music I don't like and that aren't even close to the channels artist, and when I down vote them I keep getting more of their songs. The ads are annoying too, to say the least. It could be much better, but they have to pay their bills somehow. I will from now on just buy my own songs instead. Pros: free music, a variety of music, introduces you to new songs or artists you may like. Cons: very limited, not very big on custom tuning the channels to your preference, intrusive ads every other song, irrelevant songs often."
"December 7, 2014","This app will start to play a station then it will have another music station overlapping the first. I tried updating. Did not work. I tried un installing. Not working again. This app needs work."
"August 12, 2014","Best free music available on the web. I have it now on my smart TV's and my Smart Phone and computer. Who needs to pay Sirius XM over $100.00 per year to hear their choices when you can select your choices at Pandora."
"April 4, 2013","This is an amazing service - You are not limited to a certain style of music and have virtually every type of music at your finger tips - Therefore Pandora is suitable for any age group or taste in music. . . One can even have numerous different stations depending on your mood of the day . . . . .Bravo Pandora!"
"September 7, 2016","have trouble with it freezing up on mobile app sometimes"
"May 23, 2017","I enjoy the music."
"January 23, 2017","awesome product.. will buy again"
"January 18, 2017","Easy access to the latest music."
"September 15, 2016","Love using pandora to jam out with friends and family."
"May 24, 2016","I like a variety of music, and I can set various playlists to enjoy the moment!"
"July 17, 2014","Pandora is a great app. I have it on my android Phone (HTC Thunderbolt), my laptop and my android tablet. I only have the free app for now but the makers deserve something for this fine app and so I plan on getting the Plus."
"December 10, 2016","Love thump print plays what I pick"
"March 16, 2016","It's a good app. it came in handy when I needed something other than my playlist to listen to."
"August 10, 2016","Love all the uninterrupted music and the selections are great."
"July 7, 2016","Pandora stoped working for me today and I tried redownloading and it still wont work"
"December 18, 2016","My favorite music listening app."
"February 5, 2016","I love classical music and opera. Pandora offerings are very good. Performance in my car is exceptional."
"February 13, 2016","I listen to this all the time. All down fall is having to listen to commercials unless you pay for it."
"June 9, 2016","Didn't know what I was missing. I love it. I could listen all day if I could"
"December 5, 2015","Nice and clear layout on my Kindle Fire HD screen. I don't see that it has an 'i'm tired of this track' option though."
"August 15, 2013","Pandora is the best app we have. I can stream my favorite artists and group them other artists of a similar nature. This only improvement I can suggest it to let you have the option of build a radio of ONLY your favorite artist(s) like I tunes does. Paying for that feature would be fine."
"April 26, 2014","I've been using this app now for over a year. I have it on my DirecTV DVR, laptop, smartphone, and now Kindle. The free version has very few ads, and by playing 'genre' music I hear a variety of artists and find out new artists and music."
"January 1, 2017","Love having my music as I want it"
"May 5, 2014","I would give this app a 4.9 I want to listen to music but it's like a radio you love the band but you really don't know the band that isplaying or you favorite kind of music for example country but you don't like the singer but great app"
"December 10, 2016","Love, music is my thing! Love music!!!."
"December 26, 2013","I love music, I enjoy hearing the Tenors sing, Yanni's instrumentals, my Celtic voices and, relaxing piano, and the Golden Oldies of the 50's. But not everyone in my house like the music I do, so with Pandora, I can listen to whatever I want. Thank you Pandora."
"January 20, 2016","They play the best songs and I can pick an artist and they will find songs that are similar. Great variety."
"September 16, 2016","Fantastic Loooove this station. Thanks so very much."
"August 3, 2016","I cant use anymore because it says this station is not avalible"
"October 25, 2016","I just love Pandora, great variety of music."
"April 28, 2017","Love the variety!"
"February 2, 2016","This is the best way to get music download this.😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😄😄😄😄😃😃😃😁😁😁😁😁😉😉😉😉😉😉🐱"
"January 10, 2017","Love my Pandora on all devices."
"January 23, 2017","Great product excellent service"
"February 9, 2017","totally in love 💘with my music"
"January 1, 2017","One of my most favorite Apps!!!"
"February 6, 2017","Haven't really listened to it??"
"December 27, 2016","Its Pandora, whats not to like."
"February 15, 2014","I already had a Pandora account on my desktop, so I knew what I was getting. I can get most any music I want including the Hawaiian artists. My husband would love to get some contemporary german music, but that is up to Pandora and not the apps fault."
"December 20, 2012","I love using Pandora. The only problem I have with this app is: I haven't found a way to scroll back through previously played music to rate like or dislike. I would like that option because I like to turn it on and just let it play while I cook or clean. The more you like or dislike a song, the more Pandora learns your style."
"August 28, 2016","Nice to listen to all my favorite songs one after another"
"April 28, 2014","downloaded the app and it worked for 5 mins. so I decided to delete to redownload and it won't delete and when I click it to open Pandora ot takes me back here"
"February 6, 2013","So much so,i upgraded to ONE ,Yes now no commercials hardly i think ,any way the service is great and way better than the almost 15 bucks for Satellite S_ _us ,plus you make your own stations its cool ,i connect via bluetooth in my car for my 40 min drive one way every day ,just music ,i love it Thanks Pandora ,E.Perez"
"January 23, 2016","We all love this one. Works just like it does on an iPhone. Used for a new Kindle we got for the family."
"August 10, 2016","love Pandora! limited commercials and a great music selection"
"November 22, 2015","Thank goodness apps like these exist. Sometimes I get bored of the radio, or my own music. This fills the gap perfectly!"
"September 25, 2015","I enjoy this free online service! I think it is neat that you can expand your artists , but it seems like the same songs are played."
"January 11, 2013","I absolutely love Pandora. I love music and Pandora allows me to listen to all my favorite artists without having to change CDs. I use Pandora when working in the kitchen and use it at night when I am restless and unable to sleep. I love being able to type in an artist and there he/she is for me to listen to. Amazing!!"
"July 6, 2013","This is terrific! I updated to Pandora one it's soo good! I love it it's so good if you search a kid station like, spongebob radio it just plays spongebob songs! How good is that!? I love it it's a terrific app. 5 stars! Or if I could do infinity I would! You should buy this app it's terrific!"
"June 9, 2016","I have used Pandora for years and have no issues using it on our kindle. :)"
"September 21, 2013","Since I am brand new to this new experience (thanks to my daughter), I haven't had a chance to put many artists on my kindle yet, but what I do have is delightful to have playing as I read or play games. I would never have heard about this or enjoyed this app on my own. Thanks!"
"November 16, 2015","This is one of the best things ever!! This and it's competitors are both exceptional, and this is exceptional. Love it."
"August 17, 2016","Very convenient to listen to the music you chose and like !"
"August 27, 2014","I have only been using Pandora for a very few days, but so far I'm happy with it. It has a good selection of music and seeing as how it's free, you can't complain about any of it. If you don't like it, turn it off."
"May 12, 2016","I found a station I love! I can dance all day and night to Cupid Shuffle Station!"
"March 31, 2016","Great service for free. I subscribed as well & it was well worth it compared to Sirius/XM."
"January 2, 2017","No problems so far. Thank you."
"January 12, 2017","Great music..that you can pick"
"August 17, 2017","Unable to load on my android!!"
"August 7, 2017","Easy to use and BIG selection."
"January 28, 2017","Great music even with the ads."
"December 25, 2016","App doesn't work half the time"
"February 9, 2017","My go-to for the music I want!"
"January 15, 2017","Excellent! What's not to like?"
"August 8, 2015","worked great until the latest update on 8.7.now it just cycles through the play lists and tells you it can't find any songs?? Greedy bastards!!"
"September 15, 2016","Love this music app. Tons of variety to choose from!"
"May 24, 2016","you guys are great Pandora you keep your listeners satisfied with great music!"
"May 15, 2016","Great choices, and the predictive algorithm is great at introducing new artists."
"November 21, 2013","Got this for my Kindle Fire in July. If I had written this review last week I would have given it 5 stars, but I just installed an update and things have changed. Loud, frequent commercials, stops playing for no reason. Wish I could go back to the previous version!"
"January 27, 2016","I love it because it has tons a music like blue October here comes the mummies and blaggards Mike patton"
"March 18, 2013","I loved it, it's a really a nice app. Get it if you want. But it only sometimes plays the song you were searching for. It has contant adds, buy you can play games and such and listen. You only have limintive time in a month. You could pay a dollar if you want to countiue a month. Hence why I'm Not on there Now."
"August 10, 2016","This player is most welcome and recommended to all listenerd"
"January 18, 2016","how can you not love genre specific free music? pandora is the best at it, keep up the good work pandora!"
"December 18, 2016","love it....so easy to use too!"
"June 12, 2013","Two Words: Get It. But since I can't submit this with two words, I'll rave about the awesome so that Pandora is. It has millions of stations to choose from, barely frequent ads, skips, and a thumbs up/down system that helps to get the music that you love. And it's free! How good does it get?"
"August 10, 2015","I love this app like it nothing whoever wants this get it. If you like any kind music it's on hear. IT IS THE BEST MUSIC APP IN THE WORLD!!!!!"
"February 22, 2014","Frustrating because when I tried to use the app i kept getting an error msg. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but it still didnt work. I use pandora on my media box at home and I love it so I was really hoping to use it on my kindle. :-("
"December 26, 2013","It is so much better just buying the subscription so no commercials are played and the sound quality is awesome. I play it just about anywhere I can. i did love the sleep setting but the last update has removed it (Or I just can't find it on the new home page)."
"June 17, 2013","Love Pandora. Sound quality is great! If you already have a Pandora account, you will be able to use this with ease. If not, this app also makes it easy to get started creating stations based on the types of music or artists you like. And all for free!! Who can argue with free. Would recommend!!"
"March 1, 2016","I had to use Spotify instead because it didn't let me download the app in Argentina. Ridiculous."
"April 3, 2014","I like it. Music selections fit. well in My initial selection. Theme. All I had to do was to type in a artist name the music began to play. It also provided artist history ad album cover. I hadn't discovered all of te abilities, but I will."
"January 1, 2015","Love it"
"August 16, 2013","I really don't get this app. While trying to listen to music, different songs would start playing and I couldn't shut it off. Very dangerous, if you have kids don't let them use this app, as you don't know what song will turn on. I immediately deleted this app minutes after buying it."
"October 13, 2017","Loving the music!"
"December 8, 2013","Good selections tied to one's choice of artist, although one would like more control after a first extended listen. A thumbs up for a song tends to spread the choices even more, as it increases the branching ""links"" rather than narrow the range."
"November 16, 2016","In my opinion Pandora is the best radio place to have. I use it more than my actual phone music."
"August 17, 2017","Best thing ever"
"August 7, 2017","Great music app"
"January 2, 2017","Fantastic use it all the time"
"December 30, 2016","commercial after every song!!"
"January 31, 2017","Love listening to Pandora ♡♡♡"
"December 27, 2016","Not the best butt pretty good"
"May 24, 2016","it's great to be able to listen to the music you like. and it's all for free."
"October 2, 2016","Enjoy listening to songs I am not familiar with"
"October 15, 2016","Good tunes, randomly for hours. Very pleased"
"March 7, 2016","Love being able to pick genre or artist and listen to what is current or good old school stuff"
"November 28, 2016","It doesn't keep the songs I put in"
"September 19, 2016","Happy with this app any music that I want is there"
"March 27, 2014","Really like the exposure to some artists that I would never listen to otherwise, songs I like but haven't purchased, or never even heard of. Yes, with the free version, the ads are annoying but nothing is free. So far working trouble free."
"January 2, 2013","I really dont know whats going on but the download pauses and does not finish : /"
"May 23, 2016","Excellent music haven,t heard country music from the 70,s in years thank you."
"August 18, 2014","I use this app all day. Sometimes I change the selection because of repetitive songs and artists, or the artists are not what I am listening for. This is a wonderful way to have music with little or no commercials!"
"July 18, 2016","I love my Pandora, music at your fingertips just like I like it."
"March 2, 2016","I love that amazon has apps to download. The apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"
"May 18, 2016","Pandora needs to play more of the artist that I choose, not only random people"
"August 23, 2013","I have Pandora on my Roku box for my tv and I enjoy it very much, on my Kindle I can't get it to operate, ther doesn't seem to be any instructions. I have tried everything I can think of and it won't work. Dis regard the above comment. This an excellent program and works very fine."
"September 17, 2016","I love that I can listen to the music that I like."
"December 22, 2014","Best music app ever it may not allow you to choose specific songs but it adjusts to your taste when you vote thumbs up or thumbs down so get this if you want good permanent and free music"
"April 28, 2015","I love this app and service! But in the newest update they made the &#34;I'm tired of this track&#34; harder to get to and moved the sleep timer and alarm."
"January 21, 2016","Great overall, but could use more variety within a station...tends to repeat the same songs by an artist"
"March 14, 2016","Best free music app their is. It has all of my favorite genres and arsist. Just a great app."
"January 10, 2015","great to know there are still companies out there who care about quality. I can go seamlessly from kindle to tv to laptop to desktop computer without hassles. Highly recommend to all !"
"January 30, 2016","I love being able to play music at night while rocking the baby, but I hate that the volume of the ads are so much louder than the music that it wakes him up.   The selection and variety of music though is really nice and I suppose I could pay and have those annoying ads removed, but the ads themselves really dont bother me. Just how loud they are. I read one time that increased volume on ads supposedly increases their effectiveness which is why television ads are required to fall within a certain volume level.  Perhaps it is more jarringly noticeable because I am playing soft lullabies. That is my only complaint though and use this free app a lot without it freezing or having bugs."
"July 31, 2015","Good alternative to SiriusXM and if using a bloothtooth speaker you can stream through your phone using wyfi; cost is just to charge you phone."
"December 21, 2014","The gospel station is awesome it helps make my day and job a whole lot more easy having to deal with lots of people all day,it humble's my soul. Thank you Pandora you mean the world to me."
"April 23, 2015","Pandora is great. I use it very often it was easy simple to install. Sometime the advertisement are a lot but I do understand that pays for the great music service."
"September 18, 2015","I am still trying to figure out how to request only singles, right now when I enter a request it gives me albums of multiple artist."
"August 8, 2015","Easy to set stations and I can get everything Icelandic rock to children's disney classics.  Just wish it was working right now...."
"February 2, 2016","This was an app I needed to download for my daughter on her tablet. She has found use for it. Thanks."
"December 6, 2015","I really enjoy this. Music to my preference. Couldn't be more happy unless I was paid to use this app from heaven."
"September 4, 2015","I like lessoning to music when i do things. Pandora makes that very easy for me, i just go to my station and start lessoning for hours."
"April 19, 2017","I love Pandora"

"December 21, 2016","Pandora is a great music app"
"July 6, 2013","This is a great free music app to listen to all you favorite genres, artists, and composers. It's cool that you can create your station. But I don't like that you have to have a Wi-Fi connection to get on the app. But still I love it! I hope you enjoy!!!!!!!! BYE"
"June 2, 2016","Great source of constant entertainment. We listen to Pandora all the time."

"April 19, 2016","I get the chance to hear Marvin Gaye-Ramsey Luis-And the Eagles-You can't beat that."
"April 19, 2016","Great assortment and variety that also introduces me to new music based on my likes."
"July 11, 2016","My wife and I both use it on our W phones and at home using Roku."
"January 23, 2016","Everything you want and everything you need and more. I play it all the time and never get tired of it."
"May 19, 2016","Nice stations good music thanks PANDORA to have the option to hire good music"
"May 10, 2015","i love this but after a week of using it it stopped working. it wont load and it closes out every time i open it.fix it and it gets five stars. until then three"
"January 5, 2016","I love to listen to all the music I love listen on Pandora all the time and I like your service you give me"
"May 23, 2016","Great but hard to turn it off. Had to shut my kindle off to get it to stop,"
"October 10, 2016","The adds. I could upgrade but don't want to"
"December 19, 2016","I love the variety of music!"
"December 23, 2014","Love this as I can hear favorite Oldies whenever I want Also pop and Latin singers No limit to music here Very relaxing Sometimes I use head phones also love little information on artist"
"May 14, 2016","The buffing process takes five to ten minutes. Sometimes it takes much longer."
"May 14, 2016","Excellent selection. My only quibble is you can't search for a particular song"
"August 1, 2015","I love to stream my Pandora app. from my Bose speaker. It's great to have the power to create my own stations and add variety to each channel!"
"May 14, 2016","When I opened this email I was listening to Secret Garden on Pandora. Love it!"
"October 2, 2017","This app works well.. no problems downloading and also Pandora has always been my go to for music."
"June 22, 2016","Happily this app works great on our old first generation Kindle Fire."
"October 29, 2015","I have used Pandora off and on for years. Having it as an app on my phone gives me another way to listen when on the road."
"March 10, 2016","I'm not sure why this is on my account as a product I've purchased but yeah, I love Pandora."
"August 5, 2013","My favorite tunes are lined up and more added for me. I can select or discard ones I don't like. You can pick the genre and they will add more songs. I have it on my iphone and plug it in to my ""Ihome"". It charges my phone as I listen to my favorites.... it is awesome."
"July 9, 2015","I never knew Pandora played all of these good oldie mom use to listen to. Great relaxing music .I listen to it for hours , they play great oldies ."
"August 4, 2016","Greatest music app I have ever used and I've used them all."

"November 2, 2015","I have been wanting to try Pandora for a long time and a friend finally helped me get it on my phone. So far, I love it!"
"December 21, 2014","Pandora does a nice job of establishing your favorites. So long as they permit pop-up advertising, they should also permit you to skip a song you like, without jumping to another station."
"December 7, 2013","I love how it plays great songs after songs but one thing I don't like is you only have a limited amount of songs you can dislike until it plays it and gives you the notice you have disliked to many songs. Our where it plays two commercials when you skip a song."
"April 20, 2016","One of the best algorithms for picking similar songs. Introduces new artists daily."
"March 9, 2016","I use Pandora every day to get ready!! And it comes on this works great for phone and kindle"
"September 7, 2016","Great at the gym or while walking.........anywhere."
"October 20, 2016","good to heart a pleasant tune now & thein"
"December 1, 2014","The free version is fine except for the advertisments. Provides good selections based on the ratings that you give. The paid version is too expensive since I already have Amazon prime music."
"June 20, 2016","Best way ever to hear all the music I love and only the music I love."
"January 28, 2015","The reason I don't like it is because you don't get to choose what song you want to listen to so I like spotify better but you should try it I don't like it but it's your opinion."
"September 6, 2017","Great app!!!!"
"March 12, 2017","It is amazing"
"February 2, 2017","Excellent product for free!"

"July 18, 2017","I am pleased!"
"September 4, 2013","Pandora is Fantastic. It is a pleasure being able to pick my own station and mark my favorites along the way. I enjoy the freedom for free to browse and pick my favorite Genres from the 40's to 80's, from classical to film scores, and from Ella Fitzgerald to Gloria Estefan."
"September 19, 2016","Great app. I love the free vast amount of music."
"January 5, 2016","unable to use this on my new Kindle Fire 10. Works on my other kindles. Anyone else having this problem?"
"August 23, 2016","Easy to navigate, plenty of content, ultimate quality."
"February 11, 2014","sometimes they play songs I don't like but the variety that has been played on the stations I have created have opened a new appreciation for artists I really had forgotten about. thank you Pandora....now I need to expand my music collection....lol"
"September 2, 2015","Pandora is great for just the free version, but the full version is awesome. Definitely worth the price if you listen to music a lot."
"November 14, 2014","This a great product. Our area doesn't have suffice to cell towers for continously music in the car but it's great that after a pause in transmission the music continues right where it left off."
"December 19, 2013","Free radio? Music is interrupted by advertising and you now want to charge a monthly fee. I love Pandora and I am really disappointed. I can purchase Sirius xm if I want to pay for music"
"June 27, 2016","Wonderful source for curating the music that I really want to hear."
"April 29, 2014","I have Pandora everywhere my car my phone my laptop my tablet my TV. I pay for the subscription ,which takes away the ads I absolutely love Pandora. I started subscribing to Pandora when I had a birthday party coming up and I didn't want to go over thinking of what kind of songs I could play. I just put Pandora on and just kept on going with it all day I didn't have to worry about it. I did have to adjust the time it goes to sleep so that so I wouldn't have to be coming back every 20 minutes to click that I was still listening."
"November 12, 2015","Great I listen to it most of the day, all that great old time country, rock n roll,gospel, bluegrass. Love it, love it"

"August 18, 2016","Good app for my fire tablet especially since it's free!"
"December 24, 2013","Pandora Music app is the best. I love that at my Christmas party, we could just set it to the theme of music we wanted and no worries about any of my kids crazy music showing up by accident. It stayed on Pandora all night. Love this application for music."
"March 2, 2015","Recently had problems w it flipping through all the songs in a group and saying no more music left for me. Not annoyed enough by the ads yet to pay for commercial free yet."
"August 17, 2016","I can make me own station or browse someone elses. Kool"
"April 12, 2016","My son loves his music. I love the fact it at his finger tips and he has ear phones."
"November 17, 2014","Best internet radio ever. I was able to tailor one station to my likes for an exercise station. We use it at home for all our entertainment and music needs. Haven't played a CD in two years."
"February 7, 2016","Can't get Pandora to work on my Fire phone. Very disappointed. Looking to purchase new phone."
"July 21, 2014","absolutely perfect app. no trouble with it,what so ever. its great for music lovers,like myself,because you can choose from wide ranges of music,which is excellent. oh yeah,if you have a twitter follow me @87irwin !!!"

"June 2, 2017","Great sounds"
"December 20, 2016","I just love Pandora Radio!"
"July 29, 2015","still not available in my country but thankfully my mobile vpn helps with this, just wish my damn provider would stop screwing up with my 4g."
"August 3, 2015","nice but not too crazy about it it doesn't keep playing music, sometimes it just stops running and I have to keep picking the station again."
"August 24, 2014","Downloaded it into a brand new tablet. Set up an account and was told that I had used up all the free time I was allowed and I needed to buy more minutes. How can that be, I just set it up and hadn't used it."
"December 28, 2014","Only problem is I hate the commercials. Who has commercials anymore and who likes or enjoys listening to or watching them? The only commercials enjoyable are the superbowl commercials."
"May 5, 2015","I love Pandora it makes listening to music an easy experience when you don't want to download hundreds of songs or listening to a radio station full of static."
"March 9, 2014","I enjoy listening to music ecspecially after work when I'm trying to wind down. Like that u can download ALL Different kinds of music. Where I live the radio reception isn't that great & with Pandora on my Kindle Fire.... well.. no problems."

"March 3, 2015","I love pandora radio I listen to it all the time. I have even started to put it on at night for my kids to fall asleep to with a station created for l lullabies. Its great"
"August 14, 2016","great music, i don't think I will ever buy music again!"
"March 2, 2016","Best app ever! I love all types of music and this allows me to change it up whenever I want"
"March 18, 2013","We use Pandora for almost all of our music listening. We love the variety they add to the stations we create, also get to hear new artists we never would have found otherwise. We subscribed to the paid for version to support Pandora because we feel it is very valuable to us and our enjoyment of good music."
"December 29, 2013","This year I couldn't find any station on regular AM/FM radio that was playing Christmas songs. I went to Pandora, and downloaded a classic Christmas program, and listened to my heart's content. That's the great thing about Pandora, whatever you want, they have it."
"February 19, 2014","I would recommend this product to everyone. The best part of Pandora is the personalized music. It is the easiest way to choose your style depending on your mood. I love the way I can choose to like a song and to have the options to buy music."
"December 17, 2016","Very pleased with this apt"
"August 4, 2016","I love the new changes to Pandora. I like using it again."
"July 22, 2015","Songs lag at beginning of session, but eventually play. Constant stream of pop up adds annoying.  Still way better than IHeartRadio."
"August 30, 2016","Great music - love choosing my own favorite artists"
"December 3, 2016","Great choices and no clutter!"

"February 25, 2014","It's great for listening to your favorite band's station, but my only complaint would be that it plays other people's music on the station, too. That may be ok for some people, but when i want a certain station, i expect just that band's music."

"July 15, 2014","I'm surprised that, while there is a wealth of music selection within each genre, I hear many of the same songs repeatedly. Maybe there's a licensing issue. I'll continue to listen, but it is somewhat disappointing."
"April 20, 2014","Great addition to my Kindle Fire! Was able to listen to my favorite music and channels on my new Kindle Fire! This app is also available on other devices as well and would recommend to anyone who needs their fix of Music and Pandora!"

"January 22, 2014","I was pleasantly surprised to find that Pandora included the likes of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and many others of my favorites. Nevertheless, there is something here for everyone, as the numbers of musical genres and artists appears almost endless."

"June 16, 2014","I am very disappointed. Pandora, at least for me..bleeps off after about 30 seconds and may or may not even come back on. If it does, it is sure to go right off. It's not my wifi connection, this i know. Any suggestions?"
"March 21, 2014","Great program to relax and chill after a long day. I guess my only complaint would be that they do not seem to have many tracks. I find stations repeating the same songs often.I think they do not for example have many Beatles songs."

"April 29, 2016","We love Pandora in our house! We always have this app playing on one of our devices. I love this app because it saves your stations so when you come back to it you can continue listening to your station, or change it to a station you've saved before, or easily create a new station! This app is great for the whole family! My kids (12, 10, 4 & 2) all love music and use this app frequently. It's easy to use and easy to change stations so even my 2 year old knows how to turn on his favorite Disney music. There are unlimited stations to search for so anything the kids want to hear they can find very easily. We even have different profiles set on each device so we can monitor what the kids can or cannot listen to, I love the parental controls so I don't have to worry about my kids listening to bad music. We love everything about Pandora and will always use this app!!!"
"April 16, 2016","its pandora. It is the android app. It works just like the one in the playstore"

"October 6, 2012","Pandora is great! Any kind of music you want to hear is there, plus great songs you won't hear on mainstream radio. I love it on my new Kindle Fire HD.

"May 18, 2014","was fine when first installed. When I travelled, it stopped working outside US when I was at Wifi Spots. All kinds of legal text and apologies pop up. I went for Songza as alternative after that. Less hassle no subscription."
"February 14, 2016","Pandora is usually great, but it has stopped working on my Kindle Fire like other reviewers."

"December 14, 2016","Very nice to listen to."
"February 20, 2015","Pandora is supposed to be a free app but I believe you must pay for each song you play. Had difficulty locating and playing the exact style of music I was interested in."

"April 4, 2016","It used to work perfectly but now doesn't open after being updated. Such a shame."
"May 12, 2015","They need to stop the ""are you still listening"". It is quite aggravating to have to keep responding to the question. If it's on, I'm listening!"
"November 21, 2014","This app is amazing it lets me listen to all the free music I want! And it also lets me search what I want to listen to. The only bad part about this app is that it does the entire album."

"December 19, 2013","I love this!! It's one of my all time favorite apps on my Kindle Fire HD. It's nice because I can't really afford to buy music all that often (my music area is currently empty on my Kindle). The one thing that's annoying is that it sometimes won't load."
"January 25, 2014","I'm a huge Pandora fan and I love that Pandora has many formats and readily available apps. Even of you have the free version with commercials, they are honestly not that intrusive because they are few and far between I highly recommend this app."

"February 20, 2014","I enjoy being able to select my own music, comedy or whatever I feel like at the time! I listen to it in my car, at the office while taking a bath and the music changes with the mood. No more commercial better than fast forward on the TV!"
"October 12, 2017","I like it"
"April 23, 2014","I've loved Pandora since I found it on my old computer. I listen to music that goes with what I'm painting. Also, I like that it gives the history of the bands, artists and writers. You can get the lyrics too, in case you forget."

"February 14, 2014","I love the way Pandora plays and chooses music based on your favorite artists. They introduce me to music and artists I had not known. I like the ability to let it know what I like and don't like to better customize my listening experience."
"December 27, 2014","I've always liked Pandora and I was so excited when I saw there was an app for my Kindle. We listened to Christmas music on this all the time for the holidays and it was awesome."

"April 27, 2016","the free version has limited ads. I had difficulty in selection a program."
"January 1, 2014","been using Pandora for a few years and now getting around to reviewing. Switched to Spotify for a while but now mixing between both. Great for free music service and introducing me to new music. Plays some of the same songs more than I would like."
"March 20, 2013","I now know what the buzz about Pandora is about!. I now have it on my Ipod, Iphone and Kindle Fire. I have a pretty extensive music collection and listen to it most of the time , but the ability to here different music from genres that I like with the very good fidelity that Pandora offers is nice."
"February 9, 2016","On my tablet, it plays one song at a time, then, I have to turn the tablet off then back on."
"January 26, 2016","LOVE LOVE LOVE. Must have. It would be even better without the ads but it's still so worth it"
"May 14, 2016","Love that I can listen to whatever style of music I want at the moment."
"October 11, 2013","Pandora keeps me company whatever I'm doing. Whether it be driving my granddaughter in the car, walking around the neighborhood, or working out at the gym or on my treadmill. Pandora provides whatever music I'm in the mood for and keeps me in tune (pun intended)."
"March 20, 2014","I have discovered so many beautiful songs and outstanding music from Pandora. I had a limited amount of music in my life but have now expanded tremendously ever since I started with Pandora! Please keep up the fantastic work Pandora!"
"July 18, 2016","Love the variety of music and the personal connection..."

"August 30, 2016","Everything has always been very smooth for me."
"May 9, 2014","I have used Pandora off and on for many years. It has been a great way to filter office noise when I need to work. This app plays in the background on the Kindle HD while I work with another app. Highly recommend this app."
"July 30, 2016","To many commercials. Spotify is soooooo much better!"
"August 12, 2016","Love that I can pick my own songs from yesteryear."
"August 12, 2016","it's because you need to pay money to not have ads"
"December 2, 2015","By customizing as you go along, Pandora learns just what I like on my channels and is well worth the price."
"January 7, 2013","Do you like music? Do you like free music? Are you interested in listening to your favorite bands while also discovering new bands? This is the app for you. It streams music based on a playlist. The playlist is created by adding a song/album/artist you like and then it streams music similar to your choice."
"March 23, 2015","Pandora is the best radio station because it gears the music according to what you like to hear. I'm so thankful that Pandora is there for my listening pleasure!"

"August 27, 2013","Everything I expected it to be . . . with auxiliary speakers, headphones or my Kindle Fire HD . . . amazing! Very satisfied!"
"May 7, 2016","I can pick what style or artist & that is better than any radio station!"
"November 27, 2015","it gives me all the songs I want its cool fin and it doesn't kill yo gibe though and it got my favorite song"
"March 1, 2016","but it fails to operate on my kindle fire. I use Pandora on my laptop, and I love it. You have to understand what pandora is for to like it. It is to create stations based on your genre and band preference, which thru like and dislikes Pandora determines for you. Great app, but I wish it worked for my kindle fire"
"April 19, 2016","Am in love with Pandora!!!!! My brother told me about it and I am hooked!!!!"

"December 2, 2016","Good app enjoy the music"
"October 28, 2013","Just wish I could play the exact song I want. But I listen to a lot of music with this. You get used to the commercials after awhile. It's better than paying for it. I like that I can Like or Dislike songs so I hear what I want and don't hear what I don't like."
"April 14, 2015","Listen to your own personalized mix of stations. Music, comedy, stories. Fewer comercials than terrestrial radio, and the app is free. Good times for all!"
"June 1, 2016","have always loved Pandora it is great,Amazon is great for offering"
"November 29, 2013","Great, intuitive, internet radio service. This app does Pandora justice. It is easy to use, fun, and provides a simple interface for the user - which is precisely what you want when you are trying to focus on your music and not the settings on an app..."

"January 30, 2016","I installed it on my amazon fire and pressed play. Nothing. It doesn't work. Any suggestions?"
"December 9, 2016","Love the P"
"January 9, 2014","I LOVE Pandora. You can choose which genre you would like to listen to. You can choose which singer/band/group you prefer. You can pick as many as you like. And the really neat part, is that if a song comes on and you don't like it you can ""thumbs down"" it and it will never play it again!! If you just don't feel like hearing a song at that time you hit another key and it will skip to the next selection but will play it again some time. It is a wonderful thing to have!!"
"December 22, 2016","perfect with our Echo!"

"June 26, 2016","We listen to Pandora a lot, and we love everything about it."

"December 12, 2016","Pandora is AWESOME!!!"
"April 23, 2014","When a friend sends me a Pandora song he likes, when I click on it I get something similar, but not the song I want to hear. I don't need Pandora to ""broaden my horizons"", I want to hear the song my friend sent me....."

"December 26, 2014","it is an amazing program. I loved it the first time I downloaded. The only thing they need to fix is the amount of skips u can use. But other wise it is a very good app to have."
"December 31, 2014","I love pandore because I get free songs any time! I just love to play games like PVZ and have songs on pandore (they let the song play when you go to a game or some like that)."

"December 22, 2016","Good even with advertising."
"November 20, 2015","Four stars. It won't play the songs I request nor stay on the artist I want. But great radio other than that"
"June 30, 2013","Pandora has some great features and it provides music everywhere I go. This app. has one draw back the repetitiveness of certain songs and or groups over others. I.E. playing Pink Floyd's version of Shine on you crazy diamond and then playing David Gilmour's version 3 songs later."
"October 29, 2015","I love Pandora radio. I can listen for hours and not hear a bad song. I rarely listen to regular radio anymore."
"September 9, 2016","Have used this service for years, love it!"
"April 21, 2016","Good but only get 6 skips before you are locked for an hr on a crappy song"
"June 28, 2015","Deducted a star because PAID version is a bit pricey. I just use the FREE and Pandora could stream more of the artist's music that you pick."
"July 31, 2016","Great app. Figured out likes and dislikes quickly."
"December 17, 2016","Keeps shutting off!"
"December 8, 2016","Easy to use.........."
"December 17, 2016","Great music choices"
"May 8, 2016","Even the free version is great. Listening to music I love is so easy."
"August 25, 2016","Excellent way to listen to my favorite music!"
"June 22, 2014","My Pandora app hasn't been letting me play the station I want and keep the music playing when I exit the app, so when I exit the app the music stops, it's super annoying , but it's still good when it actually works"
"June 7, 2016","Best offer around. Hear the music you love and no commercials."
"June 25, 2016","I really liked the music. It was like you were on vacation."

"October 5, 2014","At first I loved it! But the second day I had it I couldn't listen to the music all it would do was play ads!!!!!! And then it said my email was ""invalid"" do not get this app!!!!!!!!!"
"May 14, 2015","Pandora has been lots of fun! Creating stations that play only the songs and artists you want to hear and other stations for changing moods is great."
"December 27, 2014","Wonderful! The sound on my Kindle is very good. Pandora offers your favorite music at a touch. The Kindle goes with me and it is so convenient to listen to my favorite music."
"February 7, 2014","Now I can have my music any time I have WiFi. A huge assortment of music...anything I'm in the mood for both on Kindle and PC or laptop. Love that I can get pretty much anything from any genre. Thanks for keeping music in my life!!!"
"January 6, 2014","Good enough to listen to here at work minus the ads and commercials it's pretty convenient ! Wish I discovered Pandora seven years ago before I wasted hundreds of dollars buying music from iPod music store that I lost when my laptop crashed ! Lol"
"June 9, 2013","My down loaded music in my I pod from I tune which I love, love, love , kindle fire refuse to receive it in transfer, wish I strongly disagree. I should have bought a tablet compatible with my I pod so there wouldn't be trouble in transferring I tune music from Apple to kindle"
"January 8, 2017","great app AND free"
"January 31, 2017","love love love it!"

"January 19, 2017","It keeps buffering"
"January 23, 2017","great app and free"
"April 7, 2014","I don't install that many apps on my Kindle. (I currently have Yahoo Mail, Adobe Reader, NewEgg, and U.S. Presidents installed.)  I installed Pandora a week or so ago, the first app I installed in a couple months, and more as a lark than anything. I love Pandora, and have it on my iPhone and my computer. I listened for a few minutes, then paused it, went to the home screen, and then forgot about it.  A few days later I opened my Kindle; Nothing happened. I assumed the battery was drained. I pressed the Power button a few seconds: it gave a little chime, nothing else. I closed the Oragami case, hooked up the charger, and let it sit for twenty minutes. Then I tried opening it. Nothing. I pressed the Power Button again, a little chime. I waited half a minute and the lock screen appeared. The indicator said 64% charged, so it had some charge the whole time.  I tried unlocking the Kindle. Nothing happened for about twenty seconds, then the unlock icon slid left and after a few more seconds the PIN screen appeared. I entered my PIN, nothing. Then after a few seconds the dots appeared, one a second or so, and the screen unlocked. I pressed the Home Screen button, and after a few more seconds the Home Screen appeared.  I got to the Apps section, and uninstalled Pandora. I rebooted the Kindle, and everything was normal. I have had no problems since I uninstalled Pandora.  Maybe it was an interaction with Pandora, or maybe it runs in the background and got confused when I left my home WiFi network. I am not sure what happened exactly, but when something radically unexpected happens I have to think it was the most-recent change that caused it, especially since my main use for my Kindle is reading books."
"December 31, 2013","This is a great concept for listening to music. You get to pick the format, no DJ wasting time amusing themselves, and if you don't like the song you can reject it without having to change the channel! You are completely in charge and it's FREE!"
"December 2, 2016","Great listening music!"
"August 28, 2016","Too many ads...Amazon prime music has no ads"
"February 20, 2015","It is everything I hoped it would be and more!! Really am enjoying it. Thanks for. Thanks for all the different kinds of my favorite music that I enjoy listening to."
"August 20, 2014","It's great music to fit my taste and my mood. It does a pretty good job of suggesting new music based on my selections. After all, it's Pandora. What's not to like. Minimal commercials and it's free!"
"July 15, 2016","I love the line up after selecting your song of choice"
"September 19, 2016","Great place to hear your favorite music"
"January 18, 2013","I really like Pandora. I can pick from any kind of music and even comedy. I listen to it a lot. Mostly the comedy stations."
"February 13, 2016","It has all the stations I love to listen to if u love music u should get this it's a 5/5"
"March 15, 2016","I LOVE THE NEW THUMBS UP THAT YOU HAVE NOW ALOW USE TO KEEP PLAYING OUR OWN MUSIC"
"May 10, 2016","Um who doesn't love continuous music with the ability to add variety?"
"July 23, 2016","Pandora is good that's where I get all my music from"
"May 27, 2016","I enjoy Pandora it is nice to be able to have so many selections."
"July 22, 2015","Sone how on the way,it start mixing with some other kind of music which wasn't chosen in the first place. Over all very happy with it."
"July 27, 2016","I wish I could select my songs in an easier manner."
"July 5, 2013","The type of music and music styles I prefer are not the usual bebop screaming non-verbal helter skelter styles of the '80s but more the classical styles of the piano, violin, opera, and so on. Pandora let's me choose and offers suggestions of styles I may also like. Thank you."
"November 25, 2014","I HAVE THIS ON MOST ALL DAY....THEY GET TO KNOW YOU AND THE KIND OF MUSIC IS JUST FANTASTIC.! I LISTEN ON MY ZEKI TABLET WITH SPEAKER BOOST AND IT SOUNDS LIKE I AM IN ORCHESTRA HALL!"
"December 20, 2013","I hear it everynight. All sorts of music. I love the classical and nature music. I would recommend. Enjoy !"
"December 18, 2013","The more you use it, the better it tailors the music to your taste. Wife has it on whenever the Kindle is in the room for recharging. Free service has ads, but they're less annoying than the radio. Great product, and you can't beat the price!"
"June 8, 2015","Other than hearing the same commercials all the time, I love Pandora. At least the commercials aren't 10 minutes long like on commercial radio."
"August 9, 2016","Easy to set up and a delight to listen to......."
"February 3, 2016","Much better than paying Sirius for the same thing. Lots of great channels to choose from."
"December 13, 2016","Great app for music"
"October 25, 2016","Good APP but is it just me or have the ads gotten more frequent compared to a few years back?"
"July 9, 2016","Always loved this app and having music i love on the go"
"October 8, 2016","Works very well enjoy it very much"
"December 13, 2016","Cuts out frequently"
"September 13, 2015","I'm ""old school""......Very happy I was able to locate this app. ; Constantly listen to Country 2000's tunes......"
"October 13, 2016","I can listen to the music I love!"
"July 26, 2016","Pandora is one of the most reliable music provider."
"February 3, 2014","I love Pandora radio. I listen to the Temptations, the Dells, Kenny Vance and the Planetones, the Shirelles, and a host of other famous groups from the 50's and 60's. Then when I want a change of pace, I am able to listen to Sara Brightman!"
"April 20, 2016","Love Pandora. All the great music that you love just by making a channel."
"August 7, 2015","I tried to listen to music and it kept on saying switch to a different station over and over again do not get it whatever you do !"
"October 13, 2017","Great"
"January 28, 2014","Great for picking out the kind of music you want to listen to and who minds those short little ads if its free and ABSOLUTLEY NO ANNOYING COMMERCIAL except for an occasional short one....and it's FREE, as long as you dont pay to not get ads."
"January 19, 2016","Love it! I keep Pandora on at the office ALL day, and it's great to have when I go for a run!"
"July 8, 2016","I really like Pandora. I would recommend it to anyone."
"December 6, 2015","My entire family uses Pandora. It offers something for everybody. I personally love the comedy station."
"October 20, 2016","You gotta have music, great app"
"September 20, 2016","I love Pandora and the music is great."
"November 18, 2014","Too many commercials. It used to not have so many but now it does, and the price for membership to lose the commercials is too high. Therefore I don't recommend Pandora any more."
"April 19, 2016","Stations are great. Very motivational when I put headphones on and walk."
"June 22, 2016","The reason I gave Pandora a 5 star rating is because I can put a favorite tune in there and Pandora will introduce me other songs & muscians similar to my favorite. This gives me openings to artists I would have probably never heard of before. It's fantastic!!"
"April 29, 2017","Just don't like that it stops playing and then asks if you're still listening...if I didn't wanna listen I would log off..I don't even mind the commercials interrupting...but I do mind when my music stops playing and I have to stop what I am doing to press the button. Otherwise I love this!!!"
"October 26, 2015","I love being able to listen to songs of a similar nature just by typing in my favorite tunes. Easy to use , too."
"February 9, 2017","Love love pandora"

"August 6, 2015","I am so glad that amazon teamed up with blackberry and I get to have Pandora on my phone and it works great with an easy interface"
"September 28, 2016","minus the add/popups great music app"
"August 23, 2016","sat sewing and listening all day. was great."
"February 22, 2016","Love it!!! would not choose any other media for my music! been a loyal fan for years."
"July 5, 2016","Love for music on the go, customizable and easy to use."
"March 20, 2013","What isn't to love about Pandora! You get to make up your own radio stations, and if you go with the free version, the commercials are very short. I really like how it give you suggestions of artists that have similiar music so you can learn about other groups and broaden your music listening."
"February 23, 2015","Pandora is great!! I first started hearing music from Pandora at my friend's house. I'm going to school online (while living in transitional housing), so I listen to Pandora as I work. The music is from years gone by (and from movies I've watched [i.e. Dirty Dancing to name one of them]). The other day I was listening to my music and heard a song that I used to love, but haven't heard for years. It is music that makes you want to dance or just move to the music."
"January 2, 2014","Pandora is a fabulous way to listen to whatever type of music suits your mood for the moment. Much variety. 4 stars because it will ask often enough if you are still listening and you need to answer it or the music stops playing- that gets old."
"January 29, 2016","Love Pandora and all the options just wish it had commercial-free without costing anything"
"September 16, 2014","I have downloades other radio or music apps for my kindle that work just fine, but this one doesn't work if I'm not in the US, I live in Mexico and it's not available for my country...it sucks!!!"
"July 15, 2016","I was about to buy a new MP3 player but needed music now. I down loaded Pandora and within minutes was listening to great music. Easy to use very intuitive let's you like and dislike songs to cater to what you want to hear."
"November 16, 2016","Love listening to music!"
"April 29, 2016","Great music, not to many advertisement on free Pandora. Enjoy Pandora!"
"February 7, 2014","I have loved downloading this app for the shortcut to access Pandora. It has made my life a whole lot easier to access my account and no trouble at all with the download and or problems with my phone. I would recommend this to everyone."
"November 23, 2015","It's radio through my phone. The only thing I dislike is I cannot listen to the music if I am not online."
"April 29, 2016","Do not Like the layout of the music player. It is to small and crowded"
"February 18, 2014","This app allows me to listen to my Pandora stations through my Kindle HDX tablet as long as I'm within range of my home wireless router. If you have a Pandora account, and you have a tablet, I would recommend you download and install this app."
"December 30, 2013","Terrific source of terrific music. I can switch from Bjoerling to the Beatles without missing a beat. Thank you pandora, or whoever invented you!"
"November 3, 2014","I listen to Pandora everyday. I love it. The only complaint of course is the advertisements. But u can pay a fee each month and that is suppose to stop them. Other than that I love it."
"December 1, 2012","I was not successful in getting it to download onto my kindle fire hd at first, although I was able to get it onto my smart phone and computer. Initially, I wasn't able to find out why it wouldn't load, so I thought I would be unable to give it a good rating. But now it is loaded, and I am perfectly delighted."
"June 11, 2016","not having to pay for it is great! not too many commercials"
"November 15, 2014","Listen to my favorite artists and music everyday. It's quick nd easy and lots of fun. Love it"
"March 12, 2016","This app is awesome it lets u listen too so much music it's the best😇😇😇😇😇😇"
"April 19, 2016","I love it but give it a 3 because they play the same songs over and over"
"December 30, 2013","I enjoy Pandora Media because they set up a personalized ""radio station"" for me with no high pressure sales pitch and provide me with the music I love. Four stars for now cause I just started with them but am sure the ratings will go up."
"November 30, 2012","I've been listening to Pandora for several years and it is fantastic. I use it at home, at work, and now it's on my Kindle Fire HD so I can take it with me. The selection of songs they play is great and I usually listen to Oldies as well as some classical and country music, so I'm able to hear the songs I like."
"October 24, 2016","What is not to like? Great music for free! I can live with the commercials, even though there seem to be more of them these days."
"July 29, 2016","I love Pandora! Best app ever. Highly recommend."
"January 30, 2017","Great. I love it"
"December 29, 2016","Love the variety"
"December 30, 2016","Always a WINNER"
"December 20, 2016","t The best!"
"August 2, 2017","Love this app!!!"
"July 28, 2017","Keeps timing out"
"January 31, 2017","Value: priceless"
"January 8, 2017","Pandora is nice."
"January 9, 2017","Great music site"
"January 8, 2017","I love Pandora!!"
"January 8, 2017","Can't get enough"
"January 5, 2017","I enjoy Pandora!"
"December 10, 2016","I love their choices of music!"
"July 18, 2017","A+"
"January 25, 2013","I put this on when I'm walking around the house...entertaining guest...whenever I want good background music that suits my taste. I LOVE having my own radio station. Whoever compiles the tracks does a good job and knows the genre. MUCH better than the terrible B-side mixes used on Sirius."
"May 24, 2016","It opens you up to many different genre's of music that you love"
"January 9, 2014","I love the app.. the stations are so clear and the music is great.. I love the smooth jazz station... it is one of the best apps ever... the commercials are few and in between , but if you don't want them you can upgrade and they will stop..."
"January 18, 2016","I've always been satisfied with the stations Pandora creates based on my likes and dislikes."
"June 22, 2013","It's not available in Uruguay. I'm not even from uruguay, I'm just stuck here and i don't gey to listen to english music Just a sad american in an unknown country, just trying to losten to good music... *sigh*"
"July 15, 2016","Has all the music I need with out any hassle love it"
"December 19, 2016","Fun to listen to"
"April 23, 2015","I got a smart tv....so I am using all the feartures. Now I also downloaded this on my kindle so I can have music all throughout the house and at work."
"December 14, 2016","I really enjoy it"
"January 14, 2014","Pandora app is much like the website and it does sync to your account. My only dislike is the new alarm clock function does not work on the kindle Hd. It will not start playing until you open your kindle so it will never actually wake you up."
"May 23, 2016","No commercials. Provides relaxing music for my massage business."
"August 23, 2016","Quick and easy download. Good instructions."
"February 23, 2015","Pandora searches not only for that particular artist/ music you seek, finding this and similar. Often the reward is music new to you and or some you've forgotten."
"February 11, 2015","I love it! The only way it could be better is if it didn't need wick! I listen to music almost 24/7 so that would help. But other than that AWESOME!!!!!! ★♪♥"
"December 28, 2013","It's hard to beat getting to choose your own style of music with the ability to ""dislike"" a song to never have it play again. I have several ""stations"" set up to match the mood I am in whenever I want music on in the background."
"March 10, 2016","It keeps stopping the music but it isn't pauised and it says it is still playing"
"November 22, 2016","Great station choices."
"July 26, 2015","I love he many varieties you can listen to with great quality and the name of the artist and the label cover are all a plus for me."
"December 18, 2016","Its hard to use!"
"February 19, 2014","downloaded Pandora to my kindle as I have it on my cell phone, works great as you can add radio stations of your choice and artist that you like and songs from the Beatles and many more. if you like a variety of music this is for you."
"November 28, 2013","It was a very efficient app, but then I got the update and all I get is the blue Pandora screen. It freezes my kindle fire up. Just another app that doesn't work on Kindle Fire :/"
"May 18, 2016","Love Pandore to listen to my kind of music at home or in the car."
"February 16, 2016","I listen all night last Friday. It helped get me through the worst night of my life."
"September 6, 2013","All I get is the title screen and it just stays there. What a waste. At least it's free but it's still annoying."
"May 5, 2015","I love it I can listen to my music all night with no adds. It also turns of after a while which I'd nice so it doesn't take much better use. Love it"
"May 16, 2013","I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO PANDORA BEFORE, BUT HAD NOT HAD MY OWN DEVICE. I LIKE THE WAY I HAVE CONTROL OVER THE MUSIC CHOICES. WHEN I RECEIVED MY KINDLE FIRE, PANDORA WAS THE FIRST APP I DOWNLOADED AND TURN IT ON WHEN I AM ON MY KINDLE NO MATTER WHAT ELSE I AM DOING."
"April 17, 2017","Free is fine ther are very few commercials and with Amazon Prime I have access to lots more, plus I have over 7000 tracks on my ipod.I have more music than I could possibly listen to. But Pandora is great."
"September 26, 2016","I like it because I can get variety"
"June 20, 2013","This is light years away from the old hi-fi and 33's I received for my 16th birthday. In seconds I can set up stations of whatever kind of music I want, and it stays there from phone to computer to Kindle Fire HD. I am surprised at the quality of the sound on my Kindle! Love it!"
"November 21, 2016","no problems I like it."
"September 12, 2016","I love hearing my music anywhere I go!"
"November 14, 2015","I always enjoy listening oldies and Pandora never fails me. Plays all the good top music and all originals"
"October 22, 2015","I keep trying to get the station Pitbull, they play a few and then change to country. That just doesn't get it."
"December 1, 2015","Great for when I know what kind of music I want to hear but can't think of which songs I want to play."
"September 29, 2016","Alot of commercials but works well"
"December 3, 2013","If you get a radio app...this or iheart radio any day! Great variety in both. Popular songs that are easy to sung dance or rap to. Both have an option to turn off explicit content and limited commercial interruptions in both. Great joy to listen to"
"December 25, 2013","This thing didn't even come up for me. You probably shouldn't get this. I even let it load for a while."
"April 30, 2014","Better than a radio, because I can have a say in what plays. If I don't like what's playing just give it the thumbs down and it stops right away. I have rediscovered many old favorites as well as found some new favorites."
"December 31, 2016","I love Pandora!"
"February 6, 2017","great selection"
"January 30, 2017","Love Pandora!!!"
"December 31, 2016","love my pandora"
"September 6, 2017","It's fantastic!"
"August 21, 2017","Love Pandora!!!"
"December 22, 2016","I love Pandora."
"January 26, 2017","I love this app"
"December 28, 2016","great for music"
"December 22, 2016","So far so good!"
"February 12, 2017","I love Pandora."
"January 23, 2017","Best thing ever"
"January 9, 2014","I highly recommend this for u music lovers out there who just like free music. The only set back is that u can only skip so many songs a day and that u have to pay to get it ad free. Those are the only to reasons that I rated it with 3 stars."
"August 24, 2016","I love that you can play anything you want"
"August 28, 2016","Great way to listen to my favorite music."
"January 10, 2017","I Love Pandora. I love listening to it when I am cooking in the kitchen. I like having it on to turn on random songs why I am running or walking. The only thing I don't like about it is it's streaming and using up your data on your phone. And it uses a lot of data. But the stations you can make up and you can add other artist to the stations you can make up is pretty awesome. I have the Neighbourhood radio station. Do you that I added Calvin Harris. So I can have dramatic songs and happy dance songs all at once. It's kind of like having the best of both worlds."
"October 24, 2016","I have a hard time with this"
"September 14, 2016","it works better than I was hoping for"
"August 19, 2016","I love that I can listen to whatever I like"
"July 6, 2016","never really use this app much. I prefer Iheartradio"
"December 10, 2016","Good item, I like"
"August 1, 2016","Great radio station can program my own station."
"May 14, 2016","Love the ""Moody Blues"" on Pandora. It has all my favorite"
"March 6, 2015","I love Pandora because you get free music, and who doesn't like free music?? I know I do. You get to decide what you listen to and base a radio off of your favorite song or band."
"October 23, 2016","Love having my music playing"
"May 9, 2016","good music all the time,,all the songs you like at your fingertips"
"July 25, 2013","I like pandora a lot. I am dissatisfied with the 40 hour time limit a month. Also I would like more skips an hour. Pandora is good about volume. Thank you, Pandora for getting me through my workday one week a month. I only wish we could spend more time together. For free."
"January 12, 2014","I have the free subscription,and I love it. I have enjoyed Sirius FM in my Ford Escape,but cancelled it because of cost. I am 80 years old, retired 21 years,and watching my expenses. Sirius offered a half-price deal for six months, which I accepted. When that expired, I cancelled again. When I received a free subscription to Pandora, I accepted. Pandora offers a wide variety of music selections to suit almost anyone's desires. Pandora also offers a premium version with no commercial advertising for about &4 per month which is about the same as Sirius offers for a 6 month contract. I feel that I am receiving better music choices at a lower cost,since I have the free version, but would still prefer Pandora even if I chose to pay for their premium service"
"February 17, 2014","I haven't attempted to make numerous accounts but the home screen will not allow me to listen to music. It says we are having unexpected technical difficulties"
"April 29, 2015","Pan Pan Pan Do Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra"
"October 14, 2016","Play same songs too frequently"
"March 10, 2016","Won't stay playing on my Kindle Fire, don't like the ads. Not what I expected."
"October 9, 2017","itk"
"September 26, 2016","I love variety of mm usoc choices."
"January 17, 2014","After using the free Pandora for years, I upgraded to the Pandora One subscription. I can follow my favorite singers and groups and I enjoy having the music ad-free. I have a few others on my phone and ipad, but Pandora remains my favorite."
"March 3, 2017","A great variety of music a some I haven't listened to yet"
"November 26, 2016","I love love love it."
"February 17, 2014","I love listening to Pandora either from my car streaming through my speaker system, or at home on my blue tooth sound system.I love music and it motivates me always. So glad Pandora has this service! Makes my life so much better! :)"
"December 8, 2016","Great music site!"
"May 3, 2016","I love being able to customize what I hear by my thumbs up or down."
"August 28, 2013","This is the best radio app you can get. The songs are good and the stations you can create are endless. Ok, so there's commercials. It's free, so what do you have to lose?"
"April 15, 2014","It was easy to download and now I have the kind of music I enjoy listening to anytime I want it. So glad I finally did this. It will come in handy on our next vacation having the music we enjoy traveling around the state."
"December 10, 2015","I started typing in my info but it said unable to log you in right now so I will see later I guess?"
"April 5, 2015","This app is the best app ever I use it every day and you will to if you will try it so get it today it has an alarm clock if you get it on a kindle fire."
"January 30, 2013","No complaints on the app itself. I wish they would have a feature to ""scrobble"" (like last.fm) tracks from iTunes to get better tuned stations. However, I find the stations based on artists generally bring me new music that appeals to me for similar reasons as the original listed artist does."
"June 3, 2016","It won't stream on my kindle fire at all. Very disappointing"
"July 11, 2013","Worked great now gives me unexpected JSON error messages even after reinstall reinstall and kindle reset. Please fix it!!! I miss the radio at work. Made my days go by faster. I will reinstall until fixed."
"June 20, 2016","Good for popular bands but nothing for old obscure music"
"February 3, 2015","It was good and working but I still like iTunes more though because it gets you what you need.But still it was good man it was good essay.that's just me though bro."
"March 2, 2013","Pandora is a wonderful music service with 40 hours of free listening a month. I first found it on my Blu-ray player and have since added it to my desktop, I-pod and now, Kindle. You pick your favorite songs, artists or composers and Pandora plays music in and around those choices. Pretty wild!"
"January 23, 2016","I love Pandora because one can create stations from their favorite, musicians, and genre."
"January 7, 2017","I love Pandora"
"February 20, 2017","Hey, it works,"

"January 17, 2017","Awesome tunes!"
"January 7, 2017","I love Pandora"
"May 15, 2017","Pandora is excellent; but I assume everyone knows that. Best way to create your own personal radio station. Just pick a style or artist, and Pandora takes care of the rest. I recommend Gypsy Jazz."
"January 2, 2017","I love Pandora"
"January 4, 2017","Works Perfect."
"June 21, 2017","Replaced it with Spotify, which I like much better."
"January 30, 2017","Simply awesome"
"December 28, 2013","I love being able to create my own stations...that play only the music I like, while still being given the choice of new music that I might like....and If I don't....I just give it a thumbs down and it stops playing and will not show up again."
"April 13, 2015","Pandora is great. The only disappointed is that my Kindle does not have its own WiFi so you cannot listen to it out of WiFi range such as a beach, etc"
"July 31, 2015","some times a particular artist or type of music has some repitions but all-in-all, it is well worth the money if you love Music."
"August 9, 2015","A great way to discover songs from artists that you already listen to as well as discovery other artists with a similar style."
"May 31, 2017","It is the best station on the air"
"June 13, 2015","fabulous. Just found it after reading an article on Apple radio - Apple doesn't stand a chance against Pandora. I plan to subscribe too."
"August 5, 2013","Omg I use this app ALL the time. it has all really good music and u can pick the artist or genre. but as much adc I love this app I wish it had a sleep timer that it would go off in a certain amount of minutes or hours. if they did that I would NEVER get off Pandora ;)"
"June 4, 2016","Pandora Gives What You Ask For. Best compliment I can give."
"April 17, 2016","I LOVE DIS APP BECAUSE I CAN LISTEN TO MY FAV MUSIC ALL DAY, EVERY DAY"

"December 13, 2016","easy to use app"
"July 25, 2015","love it when I watch my Great Niece we go for walks and listen to the music and she falls asleep listening to the children songs."
"October 26, 2016","I like Amazon Prime better"
"May 26, 2016","My Wife uses this. I'm not one for playing Music on my phone."
"December 17, 2016","Great to have!"
"September 4, 2016","Love Pandora! Listen to it every day."
"September 17, 2016","Hours of custom music makes my day!"
"December 9, 2016","Great free music"
"September 26, 2016","Music is AWESOME. Great variety."
"February 2, 2016","I absolutely love Pandora I listen to Indian flute music before bed, I put on my timer"
"May 2, 2013","I listen to Pandora allllll the time, in my car, through my TV and while I'm getting ready, I love it. However I wish there was a way to view albums you've already listened to after you close out and there isn't a way to listen to the song again if you liked it. It's almost perfect."
"March 31, 2016","Love being able to get the music from my past and enjoying it in the car."
"December 12, 2016","very very good!"
"December 16, 2014","I love Pandora and I'm so glad it's available for Kindle users. I love that we can play a variety of genres we like and shuffle it up on our own, personal station. Thanks!"
"May 13, 2013","This app is awesome. But there is a skip limit. So if you hear a song you don't like, you can skip. But you can only skip 6 times an hour. So if you skip to a song 6 times, you have to wait until the next hour. So you're really just stuck with the song you don't like for an hour...."
"September 20, 2016","Always awesome music to listen to."
"October 12, 2016","All my favorites all the time"
"August 11, 2015","music stops right after a commercial for no apparent reason. I have used many different types of headphones wire and wireless"
"January 19, 2015","The music is great, but the song will completely stop and will not restart. Is it possible for you to fix this problem? It started slowly but happens quite often now."
"June 20, 2016","It's an excellent app for anyone to enjoy anywhere!!!!!"
"October 12, 2016","Greatest decision I ever made"
"June 11, 2016","Use Pandora on Roku and phone as well. Love this station."

"January 23, 2017","Fantastic !!!"
"February 5, 2016","Pandora is great but I'm having problems with the new update. It won't play my music."
"March 20, 2015","Very good but it seems to lack ability to go direct to specific artists or songs. This could be because I only tried free version for first time yesterday."
"September 19, 2016","Love love love this my stations!!!"
"February 9, 2016","It's okay if it wasn't for the commercials I don't listen to it enough to pay for it"
"June 13, 2014","I'm finding that, after a few songs have played, this app cuts off songs part-way through. I have to log out, wait at least 15 minutes, and log back in. It will play for a while, then start cutting off again."
"October 11, 2014","Don't liked it ,maybe I am not smart enough to understand how it work.You type music title or artist and get not what you ask,so I cancelled ,found something easier and get what ask for."
"February 13, 2016","Worked for a month and now it won't even play music. Fix thus s*** I need my music."
"August 23, 2016","I enjoy the music I love Christian music"
"December 14, 2016","This is great."
"September 19, 2013","I love this app and I can listen to so many different stations. The only downside is that it has ads and you have to pay a few bucks to not have any ads. It's not as bothersome as youtube's ads though and I don't mind it. Awesome app to have and very worth it!"
"February 17, 2016","An application I have used for about 7 years and I love more with each passing day"
"September 5, 2016","Fine for all my devices. Easy to use."
"April 19, 2013","Easy to use and plenty of awesome music. I have the basic package which means there is an occasional commercial break. I really don't mind at all. They must have ordered the sponsors to stop producing annoying commercials."
"October 28, 2015","I can't really give it a review, I downloaded it, but have not as yet been able to find a way to access it."
"March 10, 2016","love it, love it, I don't have to use up space with downloaded personal music"
"March 21, 2014","I enjoy listening to gospel and Pandora is the only place i've found that i can listen to it at work and recently discovered i could listen to it in the mornings while getting ready for work on my Kindle - love, love, love it!"
"September 22, 2016","BEST RADIO STREAMING APP. PERIOD."
"February 17, 2017","Portable music!"
"July 27, 2016","Great stations with great music of my choice!!"
"August 9, 2016","We love the ability to customize our music."
"October 5, 2015","I loved pandora until I upgraded to the 4.99 a month and now I can't get it at all! I am really disappointed...."
"November 30, 2016","Nice an beautiful"
"June 8, 2016","Love the app!! Gets me where I live.. And where I don't!!"
"June 25, 2013","I realize that somebody has to pay the bills, however, I wish that Pandora would acquire more sponsors, in order to incorporate a variety of commercials, rather than the same ones over, and over again. Otherwise, I love them!"
"March 27, 2015","I love to listen to Pandora on my smart TV and other portable devices. The random play is very nice, but I wish you could replay a selection on command."
"May 30, 2016","Love it has what I want when I want and great mood settings"
"April 24, 2015","The commercials seem the concentrate shortly after starting and then are few and far between. Many artists are not the original but are still good."
"September 21, 2016","Love it! It's the only way to go."
"May 21, 2016","use it everyday at work with my babies, they love the music!!"
"May 3, 2016","it is the best music app ever spotifiy is ok but not near as good"
"December 8, 2016","Great listening"
"April 6, 2014","I know it's free, but the songs are super repetitive a nothing but ads every other song. Now 2 ads in a row. Not really liking this app anymore."
"August 12, 2016","Great music for free, how can you beat it."
"February 2, 2016","While listening to my favorites I also am introduced to music I might not have heard."
"August 21, 2016","I love pandora I get the best music ever"
"June 29, 2016","I spend the less than 10 bucks for no ads, worth it."
"September 24, 2016","It's got something for everyone."
"June 15, 2016","Great to select what your in the mood to hear that day."
"December 20, 2012","I think my own complaint with this app is that is loads so slowly or not at all. I don't know if thats pandora's fault with all its ads or just my connections, although I don't seem to have the same problem with my other radio app or game apps for the most part. Otherwise, I love the music pandora plays."
"March 29, 2016","I absolutely love Pandora. I love the ease of listening and the variety."

"December 27, 2016","Love Pandora"
"October 2, 2014","Great idea for music except needs to play more of selected band chosen such as if Metallica radio play at least 5 songs from that artist before another artist is played. Just my opinion."
"November 21, 2015","It's great for listening to music, if you have the Pandora Plus (premium version), it is even better!"
"February 8, 2014","On my Laptop I loved when my favorite music would come on immediately,and I loved the thumbs UP and DOWN feature which was always recognized so that I could hear my favorites more often. Now I want to hear Pandora on my Kindle Fire."
"July 24, 2016","Love the music and the options for selections."
"December 9, 2015","LOVE IT!!! despite any other music APP out there, this is my go to always and has been for years."

"January 10, 2013","I use the free version of Pandora. Sounds great on my Samsung Galaxy player 4.2. The on screen ads don't bother me because my player turns the screen off after a few minutes so I never see them. As for the voice ads not that many in between songs.

"October 19, 2013","Pandora picks my favorite songs before I do! I like the thumbs up/thumbs down simplicity to help them out. It's amazing to have access to it for free. I still buy and listen to CD's but there are more and more reasons not to with services like this."

It's perfect for music lovers.  I am happy to answer any questions.[...]Please remember this is my personal experience and review with that said not everyone is going to have the same results or reactions.

"January 14, 2017","Pandora for me is by far a super station. It offers the audience a very wide variety of genres to choose from plus the ability to change stations by the click of the mouse. I love it because my moods change on a daily basis and so I adopt the music to my mood."

"October 2, 2013","I have had several radios at work, and they all last a couple years then stop working. And they get more expensive every time I have to buy one. Pandora allows me to listen to the kind of music I like all day. I tell Pandora what style or artists I like, and it plays that style of music till I change it. I have heard songs from artists I haven't heard for years on the radio. Music is a big part of my life; it helps set my mood! I am very happy to have found this ""app"" for my Android tablet!"

"February 5, 2016","Every time I try to play it, the songs all skip to the end and nothing will play."
"January 31, 2016","Great selection of music, wish I had found this app sooner, best music of my life."

"February 2, 2013","I like to lay back and listen to good music; it is very relaxing, but when Iwas finished I could not figure out haw to turn the music off. I could not exit out of the program without turning off the power button. A real plus is it offers a wide reange of music for a person to choose from."
"January 11, 2015","This app has worked well on an Andriod tablet that came without Google Play installed. Amazon is the only place that I have been able to get apps for this tablet."

Create your own channels and switch between them as your mood or activity changes. I honestly wouldn't be without it!"
"April 4, 2013","This FREE app is good if you want music in the ""background"".. Obviously the sound quality is as good as it can be on the Kindle. I have the subscription on my computer which is better than the free one. The more you use it, the quicker you can have more of the music you want."
"November 14, 2015","The low rating is because Pandora is not available to us as we are outside the US much of the time."
"February 13, 2015","It's awesome. I have discovered so many new band that I like... only problem is that they removed the lyrics section... that was one of the best features of the app..."
"January 2, 2014","Love listening while relaxing. Most songs are not part of r&b then you can skip so many. I hate when it ask ""are u still listening because we pay for you to listen"" if I have it on, then I must be listening. Otherwise, it's neat"

"November 22, 2016","Love this app.!"

"November 15, 2014","Maybe I am just too old to appreciate it? It will take some getting used to I guess."
"July 22, 2013","The reason that I gave Pandora a five is that you can make your own stations and if something does not suit your taste, you can either pass it over or give it a thumbs down and pass it over. Through these processes I have created the perfect stations for my tastes."
"June 6, 2014","I used to listen to just the radio, didn't mind the commercials. Now ? I don't listen to the radio at all. The commercials annoy me. I get to hear what I want to hear, not what someone has selected for me."
"March 5, 2014","I like the idea that you can pick the type music you like, you are given numerous choices to pick from. I am new to using the new technology so, I really like beating able to filter what I like and thumbdown what I disliked."

"March 6, 2016","It is perfect for me when out and about or just chilling at home. Love it"
"July 3, 2013","I love Pandora! It is the best radio for my kindle. The only thing I would change about it (and I hope they do), is that if u have the free version you only have 40 hours per month of listening time. So when I get up to 40 hours, I start listening to my iheart radio."
"January 19, 2014","How could you hate something that gives you what you want for free. The only thing I would change is there is no ban artist button. which I would love. If I get an artist I hate I just push the thumbs down button really fast! hahaha"
"December 18, 2016","Love it!"
"December 12, 2013","how can you not like this ""radio"" - choose as many stations of music as you like. Holiday music of all styles during Christmas, dance music, relaxing, classical............... The commercials do get in the way - but not that bad."
"November 17, 2014","I love the fact that I can create my own radio station that plays only the music I like. The free version includes commercials ... but they are infrequent and not obtrusive."
"October 23, 2013","Love my new Kindle Fire HDX! I have a lot to learn and so many books to read, and books to listen to while working on my hobbies, etc... It is truly a blessing to see and use the technology so many have worked on for many years. Kathryn Hudson"

"December 8, 2016","I loved it"
"March 26, 2016","Like being able to pick my music. Still learning how to get around."
"May 3, 2016","Awesome app...love the variety of genres and variety of song"
"November 7, 2012","Pandora is a good value for money with one major problem. After you listen for a while it pauses, and then asks do you want to continue. This is a real pain, as I am capable to telling the stupid site when I am done listening, and do not need them to baby sit me. This is why I consider it only average."
"April 25, 2014","Almost immediately after i upgraded to ad-free pandora one, i started getting error messages. (never received an error message before upgrading) it got continuously worse, sometimes shutting down the app completely, other times leaving me sitting listening to silence which eventually turned into nothing. I tried to reach them -they have NO PHONE NUMBER-i emailed them, per their instructions as being the only way to communicate with them. I expressed my dissatisfaction in the product that they were now charging me for, especially in light of the flawless experience I had enjoyed as a non-paying customer. I stated that I had uninstalled the app from my phone already, but that i hadn't cancelled the service yet, because before i severed ties completely i wanted them to refund me every penny they had taken for a product they'd never delivered. Granted it was only 4 or 5 dollars at that point, but i don't have extra dollars to throw into the wind and they didn't deserve that money@all. Long story short - i am busy and before too long, some other nightmare in my life took center stage, and I only realized that Pandora had NEVER EVEN REPLIED to my email, until..... you guessed it! i noticed the charge on my credit card again the other day! aarrgghhh!!!!!! so, thanks alot Pandora for your upgraded product, PANDORA NONE! p.s. get a freaking phone number with the money you charged me without delivering a product."
"March 30, 2016","Pandora has always come through for me providing outstanding music."

"December 7, 2016","Great. App"
"May 15, 2016","Having a lot of fun lisening to the music I grew up with."
"October 24, 2013","Om g the ads are so frequently!! Every SINGLE SKIP the same ad!!! So annoying! Pandora was way better back then!"
"January 26, 2014","It's ok but if you keep looking at how much internet you use.... that's not good trust me I used up all of my granddads internet listening to this although I do use it a hole lot... my mom made me delete it though. makes sad face."

"January 14, 2014","I LOVE Pandora on my kindle... when it works. About half the time I try to use it, it just sits on the initial ""Pandora"" screen and never comes up! If this wasn't happening so often, I'd definitely give it a higher rating!"
"February 10, 2014","I'm trying to sign in, but I keep pressing register for free, but it still won't work. I tried going on silk browser and it still won't work. I tried connecting to ATT680/internet  [...]  Subject: Music  By: Pandora Media"
"August 30, 2013","I've tested this alongside Iheartradio. I rank I heart higher only because it has a wake up alarm. Pandora did right by adding a sleep timer. Now I just want to wake up to my favorite music."
"September 18, 2016","Absolutely love the variety!"
"March 10, 2013","I love the fact that I can listen to just about any type of music I want. I like old rock music, but when I'm at work I can't listen to rock because I work with seniors so I put in big band or musicals and the seniors love it. The only problem is that they play to many commercials now."
"October 6, 2016","Did not buy this product"
"December 10, 2016","Excelent!"
"April 13, 2014","I love everything about my Pandora. I have been able to be free to create my own unique music store & set it up however I want & with all the music I want at any time & with very little commercials. And it's FREE!!!"
"September 9, 2016","So fun to listen to the music."
"November 24, 2015","I love this app because you can you it when ever and where ever you can listen to music random."
"February 4, 2016","Commercials of course get annoying, but so far only play after every 3-4 songs. Also, it seems their main focus is Western music, not much research by the musicologists, or whatever they may be properly called, on music overseas. They may have stuff on J or K-pop, haven't and do not plan to check that out, but was wanting more classical, slow music in different language and it did not locate the artist by name or give me options of anything similar."
"February 26, 2015","Easy to get to and great selection of all types of music. Now that I'm retiring I can take my tablet and listen to my ""faves"" anywhere, anytime."
"May 3, 2013","Pandora allows you lots of flexibility to create multiple stations with specified artists. Don't like a song... just skip to the next. I can listen to Contemporary Christian, love songs, or seasonal music or even shuffle between stations I have customized. Great functionality!"
"December 18, 2016","awesome"
"August 24, 2014","YESSSSS... I got 3000 Dragon City Gems from the official page, hurry up its for a limited time only https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=644218259006049 hhdjxjxnxnxnxnxnxnnxjxnxnxnxnxnx"
"September 26, 2016","Really enjoyed the variety"
"October 22, 2016","Ok but locks up alot"
"January 23, 2013","Advertising is necesary to pay the costs of the service but in Pandora's case, it is invasive and annoying. When creating a latin radio station, I gave several options of musicians but Pandora kept playing the same cheap mexican american music. Not really impressed with the product."
"August 13, 2016","Wonderful, I Listen all of the time."
"January 17, 2014","I love being able to set stations. I work out with my workout station, play calming music when I work, and sing along with my favorite songs on my sing along station. It's easy to use. Just wish I could double star my favorites."
"December 9, 2016","Excellent"
"October 13, 2016","I love my pandora!!!!!"
"March 4, 2016","What a wonderful thing to be able hear only the music that I really like"
"January 6, 2014","I love Pandora on my Kindle. It is convenient and easily accessible. I is free, and I can take it anywhere. I will be flying and know that I will be spending lots of time in airports, so it's nice to know I have Pandora available."
"December 8, 2016","Excellent"
"July 26, 2016","I prefer Rhapsody. Easier to navigate..."
"February 24, 2016","I do like this game, just wish they would give more hints after each level"
"April 24, 2016","The best music and artist picks app so far. Love their music."
"July 9, 2015","It would probably be good if I was able to download it. I always get a message to try again later because of some difficulty."
"July 9, 2015","I love my Pandora app. It's so easy to use and find my favorite music. Setting up stations helps introduce me to new artists."
"October 8, 2016","Awesome music selection"
"March 12, 2016","Just downloaded this, having several problems. Freezes up, has crashed"
"March 11, 2017","Actually pay for the subscription, so I must be a fan. A few minor problems - they apparently make no attempt to ""normalize"" the levels, leading to significant changes from track to track. And too often, especially with live tracks, the heads and tails are just abruptly clipped, which can be jarring. Also, while they do seem to take 'thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" seriously, the play lists are narrow; listening for a full day will often produce a lot of replays, with too few ""deep tracks"", just the same old popular cuts. But reliability has been good, and sound quality perfectly satisfactory, other that what was mentioned above"
"August 20, 2016","Love the way I can play the music."
"September 11, 2016","Love all the choices in music"
"May 11, 2016","Can't get enough of Pandora. I play it everywhere I can!"
"September 20, 2014","Hard to argue the quality of what this site offers for free. It does seem to progressively stray away from the channel you set up, but I guess that's kind of part of what it's about."
"August 18, 2017","5 star"
"January 26, 2017","Great!"
"February 2, 2017","THANKS"

"January 8, 2017","Great!"
"July 2, 2013","Pandora has introduced me to so many new artists that I love. I don't have anything bad to say about it. (One thing I do wish is that you could listen to a song again, or somehow store it on your device - but I understand why this can't be done.) It is easy to use and plays what I like a majority of the time. I will say: UPGRADE TO PANDORA ONE. Commercial free, it is SO worth it. I will gladly pay the $36 a year to not listen to annoying commercials and see continuous pop ups. This is by far one of my favorite apps."
"December 3, 2016","fantastic!"
"December 10, 2016","Love/ it"
"January 4, 2016","I like it, music is good, let's you personalize when a song comes on you do not like."

"February 8, 2016","It fun relaxing easy to navigate although I do wish the Skip limit was larger"
"January 2, 2014","Anyway you like it you can get it with Pandora. You can customize your music for your own listening pleasure. Whether it's Gospel, Jazz, Blues, R & B, Country, Western, Classical, or special music such as Christmas, Pandora has it."
"January 30, 2016","I really enjoy my Pandora stations. I think you all do a great job. Thank you!"
"May 31, 2016","Music is good for mind and body. Pandora has it all."
"February 21, 2015","Pandora is so fun to use but it sucks that it needs WiFi to actually listen to it. The people who made Pandora need 2 fix that little itsy bitsy problem."
"December 26, 2014","Spend the extra 3 dollars so you don't have to keep getting the annoying advertisement pop-ups. That is the only reason that I have for the less than great rating."
"May 3, 2014","This is wonderful and plays a lot of good music. You can comment on songs,like them,share them,follow people,comment on people's profile. But you have to be 14 or older to log in. Still I love it"
"December 4, 2013","A new paradigm in music enjoyment! It already has a substantial library of music to satisfy my listening pleasure. Now i probably get 95% of my music through Pandora."
"August 9, 2016","A few thumbs up and your on your way"
"March 22, 2014","The app is easy to use and has a good layout. The only thing I didn't like was how close together the rating and skip buttons are to each other. It was too easy to tap the wrong button. Everything else worked great."
"March 2, 2015","I've rreally enjoyed Pandora this weekend. All the songs were great. I didn't need a Dj for my party. I just selected my music and it played all night."
"March 7, 2013","i personaly have pro and cons of this app but I overall I like it and use it frequency. I like many things: ""liking"" a song, sharing via social network and creating custom stations. Con: repeative, sometimes slow, adds and the hated skip button. Overall I enjoy pandora!"
"June 10, 2015","this app is exilent. I use it all the time and it is so easy to control. And I really love the fact that it has a timer and alarm."
"March 31, 2016","Awesome music, excellent to listen to anytime, again just awesome"
"April 20, 2016","Ok at first but after awhile it's the same sounds over & Over"
"June 14, 2016","A good music app. Lot& lots of music. To choose. From"
"November 9, 2013","The update is cool and all but lately its been glitching. Every thing is easy access and all but when listening to a song and to hear glitches every five or so seconds is annoying."
"December 13, 2016","Awesome"
"July 26, 2016","It's just a great app to use for music."
"August 30, 2016","great app, a lot of music on it"
"July 17, 2016","I love this app because I love the music"
"November 30, 2016","Best ever."
"January 3, 2015","Pandora is excellent for the person that needs someone to recommend songs based on what they like now or then. Bummer that it doesn't have an international scope"
"December 8, 2016","Love it!"
"December 12, 2016","Great!!"
"June 29, 2016","Havent used It Much but It Does come in Handy"
"March 26, 2016","I love the stations and feeds on Pandora but if your bank changes your debit or credit card number...you are in for many phone calls to Amazon and emails to Pandora...you can not contact Pandora directly by phone. Getting my billing straight, as I am a Pandora One subscriber, took about three weeks. They have also reformatted how you view info about the artists and the music several times. They should have left alone;/if it's not broke don't fix it. Sometimes I can't connect wirelessly when away from home and on a free Wi-Fi and that is annoying and disappointing."
"June 4, 2015","Love the music while I am scrolling through my emails! Anything I feel like hearing, I just create my own radio station. Wonderful!"
"January 6, 2013","I use Pandora everywhere I go! They seemed to have cut down on the commercials lately. If I weren't a full time student I would totally pay the price for their membership. They have a great selection of streaming music. Just remember you have to be connected to the internet or Wi-Fi to use it."
"March 4, 2014","Through Pandora, I've discovered new artists and been reminded of old classics I wouldn't hear anywhere else. Sure, I wish the free version didn't have ads, but I understand they have to make a living like the rest of us."
"December 3, 2016","Fantastic"
"June 13, 2015","I love being able to listen on my tablet. I like that I can pick different genres and ""like"" or ""dislike"" songs."
"December 5, 2012","i would love it better if i could replay a song. The app itself runs great and I enjoy how the lyrics are provided for most songs. I have two friends who have paid for the app and they say its buggy and doesn't do what it claims to do so I""m hesitate to pay for it. A trial period would be nice."
"January 2, 2015","Pandora is my ""go to"" choice when wanting music. It is easy to use, the choices are very good and I can't imagine not having it available when I travel."
"July 17, 2015","Great way to play what you want to listen to. When I made my wireless speaker compatible, it is a great way to entertain."

"December 6, 2016","Love it!"
"December 7, 2014","Pandora random crashes after 20 minutes! I could be in the browser and it just completely shuts down! it's really annoying, it's like you're starting over again."
"March 20, 2013","I love building my own music station for varied activities. I have one for when work out, when I clean house, and while driving &/or traveling. I also have stations with love songs and easy listening.for those moody days, love, love extremely limited commercials. Highly recommend."
"May 14, 2014","I often try to remember what life was like without Pandora. Then i remember i just surfed radio stations constantly to find a song I want to listen to. Pandora is much more convenient and never has static :)"
"April 13, 2014","glad to see one of the apps come really close to exactly the same setup as the webpage! nice to sign in and get all the same reccomendations, and good to let run in the background while you're doing other things!"

"May 17, 2015","This is fantastic, you select the genre of music you like and pandora seeks it out for you and it's commercial fee, for the moment. Fi"
"May 12, 2014","After a little experimentation (I am not tech savvy), no problems. I love having access to the music I want to hear, when I want to hear it. Only downside, is that it drains my tablet battery as a trade off."
"September 12, 2016","Very good variety of music."

"December 20, 2013","There is advertisements that interrupt music but this is a minor downfall. Otherwise there is usually great music! I've had a Pandora account for a long time now."
"January 31, 2014","I thought it was awesome until they starting putting ads up. Don't get me wrong, I still like it but I would've given 5 stars if there were no ads. It still is a great service and I would recommend it to anyone!"

"July 31, 2014","I love music that plays when you press the home button! But here's the not so good part, you can only have 100 stations. But i have almost 400 likes and bookmarks. SO I LOVE IT SUCH!!!!:):):)"

"December 27, 2013","great app music is good but they're trying to make too much money after this don't like the advertisement limited free version I thought was better I know I can buy and upgrade but there's too many music apps that don't require that"

"December 23, 2016","good"
"December 31, 2013","Pandora is great! I TRULEY RECOMMEND You can listen to music of your choice, for free, it precautions you when a song is explicit that is about to be played... so if you have a child listening that maybe shouldn't hear something... but you can change that under settings. You can turn on the sleep timer for however long and you can fall a sleep to the music... and it will even stop in the middle of a song too. You can send a specific station or track to a friend on Facebook and a couple other ways... which is great. When you find a specific station and you click the like buttons (thumbs) or dislike buttons, it will sort the music based upon what it thinks you will like... which is great because you may not know exactly which song you wish to listen to... so it selects one for you, also it's great because if it is a classical station you might love a specific song so, you make a station for it then you can listen to it In... say d flat major"
"October 2, 2015","compatability"
"July 16, 2013","Pandora finally allows my music tastes to be satisfied in a way no radio station ever could!!!!! Country, rap, classical, pop, rock, metal, and more all in an eclectic mix which fits my personality:):):) Did I mention that I even get Weird Al on my station? LOL"
"August 10, 2016","I'm glad I have this! No problems."
"April 12, 2013","As music stream services go, this is a good one. I only use the ad-supported version, and I have seen the ads to be very wela placed, and don't interrupt the music so much. The app has helped me find artists I have never heard about, and their music has been a joy to listen."
"April 7, 2014","Okay, so I'm late in this whole online streaming thing in my 40's, But I was highly impressed with Pandora. Within the first 15 minutes, this app had somehow determined what type of musing I like and what other artists I might enjoy. I was hooked instantly. When they say you never hear a song you DON'T LIKE, they mean it. The more you rate, the more tailored your listening experience becomes. I LOVE/LIVE music......this app meets my standards! Love it."
"March 29, 2014","The commercials suck...I want to hear music...also directions for creating a station from songs is very unclear...I'm going back to iHeart"
"June 26, 2016","LOVE IT. Listen whenever I am on my computer"
"December 31, 2013","It's great being being able to specifically listen to exactly what I chose with little to know interruption ! It's like never having to flip a record or turn over perpetually to hear all the same artist 's music!! It 's priceless!!"
"January 5, 2014","I like to listen to all night radio. This keeps asking me, R U still listening. I just want it to CONTINUE. cAN this be helped.???? I paid for the upgrade edition? So far this is unsatisfactory, due to frequent stops & starts."
"August 18, 2016","Love these dolor powered lights."
"December 18, 2016","yawn"
"October 21, 2014","Can't go wrong with Pandora! Some people might complain about the commercials, but for me it's worth it to be able to listen to the huge variety of music! Absolutely love it!"
"August 7, 2014","This is a wonderful app if you are a music lover such as myself. All you have to do is pick an artist or genre of music you like and it will play music for you that you will like for hours."
"October 8, 2013","Since starting to use Pandora, my listening has broadened so much. Rusted Root, Hayley Westernra, Fun....not on my radar before Pandora. Reminds me of the Napster days...people can share their musical interests and help other listeners. Great."
"August 14, 2016","Ads and not being able to listen to a specific song make this app almost useless to me"
"October 8, 2013","I love Pandora listen to it all the time have it on my iPhone too. My problem is once I try to skip a song the app will close don't understand it, doesn't do it on my phone. Is it just me or I wonder is some other people having the problem, help."
"August 25, 2013","Their database to ""map the music genome"" is impressive, they've been working on it for at least 6 years and although sometimes I get frustrated with a couple songs that end up in the mix, they really do share a lot of qualities that I wouldn't otherwise bunch as similar to a specific artist.  One of my favorite things to do with Pandora is very similar to spending time on wikipedia... You find one artist you like and make that a new station... soon you are 7 stations away but enjoying every step of the way!"
"August 26, 2016","Get to listen to radio all day"
"June 19, 2015","Horrible app. Cant search for just any song. Seems to always play crappy music. I un installed about an hour after installing."
"February 21, 2015","This app is amazing. There are thousands of stations, probably ten thousand songs. If you want music, buy this app.  P.S. ALL of the stations are FREE!!"
"July 17, 2016","Used it for years, goes everywhere I do"
"October 4, 2016","Pandora is sexciting!"
"September 3, 2013","Pandora is a great free internet streaming radio service. Type in the name of a song, band, or even genre and Pandora will pay your favorites in and around that category. Free service has some ads, not as annoying as other free music streaming services"
"June 16, 2016","It's fantastic! Thank you whoever invented it!"
"March 3, 2013","I have never used pandora before and downloaded the app because someone recommended it to me. Was suprised how I typed in an artist of genre and I got exactly what I wanted. I got current music that is hard to find on other websites and is not even heard on my local radio stations."
"November 16, 2016","works great"
"November 12, 2016","love the app"
"September 16, 2016","Still learning to use it."
"November 3, 2013","Oh how much do I love Pandora? I listen at work and I listen at home. If I had an unlimited data plan I would likely listen to it more but I use it on my wireless without a problem. I can mix my stations and add songs. I am a fan of Pandora!"
"September 20, 2016","Great no problems so far"
"July 31, 2015","Adds get in the way I mean it's nice and all but the adds give you a reason to just download music I mean it gets old"
"December 28, 2013","I have a mp3 player that you cannot hear while cutting grass. I bought the Samsung mini S III, installed the Pandora app from Amazon and now I can listen to music of my choice Pandora music is liken to comfort food, its great."
"November 25, 2016","Great app"
"July 30, 2016","Love this app. Use it all the time."
"June 13, 2015","Love this radio's quality sound. Just wish it had a more involved way to input choice in artists...such as in Mad Genius radio."
"April 26, 2013","It's really cool cause the music is free but one problem is you can only listen to Pandora for 40 hours per. Month, and you can only skip 6 songs per hour but other than that Pandora is awsome and very convenient."
"March 29, 2016","awesome selection of music.....whenever, where ever you are...."
"July 25, 2017","Yup"
"May 10, 2016","I like it a lot. Has the music I like any time of day."
"January 26, 2017","app"
"June 6, 2016","Easy to download and easy to play. Hours of fun!"
"August 28, 2016","Great music at a great price."
"December 6, 2016","awsome"
"January 29, 2016","Not the greatest. Sometimes it plays songs that have nothing to do with any of the songs/artists that I have ""thumbed up"". In fact, it does that a lot. The one thing that I like about it is I can have it playing in the background when I am using other apps on my Kindle."
"June 5, 2016","Love the music stations and the choices you get!"
"June 18, 2015","Greatselection and music."
"April 14, 2014","Pandora gives you control of your music. By simply liking, disliking or skipping songs played on your radio station, Pandora deciders the type of music you're looking for. It has a sleep timer from 15 min. up to an hour, which is great when you like falling to sleep with music without wearing down the battery on your device. I've found that there are fewer and shorter ads on the mobile app than the website online. One place for improvement; simplify the ability to use the alarm clock feature. I can't seem to get it to turn on without having to unlock the kindle first, which defeats the purpose of an alarm clock if you have to be awake for it to go off... Everything else is fantastic."
"July 14, 2014","Its free music who wouldn't love it! One request though is there any way you can make it to where you have an option of listening to just the person you want instead of having many other bands."
"March 6, 2016","Love this app for my music selections. Better than others out there!"
"February 16, 2016","Pandora is a great app if you like to play music based on your mood or your environment. You can create multiple 'stations' that play what you want to hear by selecting a few artists or songs that you like, then the app will choose other songs that fit that style. They have spent a tremendous amount of time categorizing and analyzing every song that plays, noting the rhythm, chord structure, key, tempo, harmonics, instrumentation, etc. By analyzing the songs you pick, it can then go to its library and find songs that match similar features.  I don't believe it will play every song on a given album/CD though. There must be certain tracks that the record label allows them to play. To hear the rest, you have to buy the album of course. ;-)"
"February 12, 2016","Love listening to different radio stations depending on what mood I'm in."
"November 29, 2016","One of my favorite apps"
"September 8, 2015","Long time Pandora fan. Great variety, often finding new artists through the various stations I have set up."
"June 22, 2016","Pandora is the best thing since sliced bread"
"March 1, 2016","Great music anytime, any genre. I listen on my phone when I work out."
"May 5, 2013","I have mixed music taste, from classical to bluegrass, samba to classic rock, with show tunes and opera thrown in. Pandora puts a smile on my face and keeps it there all day, as I play music while I work. There is no substitute that I'm aware of -- Pandora is fantastic."
"May 22, 2016","Won't load correctly. Takes to much kindle storage."
"December 2, 2015","Program your own play list ! One for yourself, your kids and maybe your special someone !"
"December 25, 2013","Love Pandora - The selection of music genera and artiest is great; the more you use it and mark your likes and dislikes of songs and artists, the better Pandora gets at playing the music you like. Would highly recommend trying it."
"February 3, 2016","Love getting any music any time. My brother-in-law just told me about this."
"December 5, 2016","Great!"
"September 22, 2016","I liked all the choices"
"November 5, 2015","I love it! With this app I can enjoy my favorite ""oldies"" and learn some new favorites."
"August 8, 2013","I like Pandora for the free music and all but there are to many commercials and when it plays it the commercials take FOREVER, and when there are alot of commercials the app crashes sometimes, so please stop doing so much commercials and do an update to stop the crashing"
"February 27, 2014","i like it,, but i dont like when you go to profile and want to hear all the songs that you like, it just give you 1 min. or less each song, that part i dont like, thats why i give 3 stars and you need to put more songs"
"September 21, 2013","I was surprised at how easy it is to use; though I dislike these reviews due to need for too many words. I will continue to explore the benefits and offerings. I was slightly disappointed that a few of my favorite artists/songs were not available."
"July 24, 2015","this is Joel and I want to say that I can listen to anything on Pandora radio it just needs to not limit your dislikes"
"March 6, 2015","I listen to Pandora every single day on my roku but it is great to have it also on my phone. I am glad I can enjoy Pandora wherever I happen to be."
"April 18, 2014","I love Pandora.I have it on my phone.I downloaded it on my kindle for too.love your app.Omg cool.  Josephine baker county."

"December 8, 2016","great"
"June 20, 2013","If you like music you will love pandora. We have used it with a DVD player and now on the new Kindle Fire 32 gb She has not put it down in a month I thought I would get to play around with it myself after a week or two but it looks like I will have to buy my own."
"February 28, 2016","have it on my kindle can go anywhere and listen to good country music"
"May 12, 2014","Wonderful app. Easy to use, great selection. Can't imagine going back to regular radio stations ever again. Thanks so much!"
"November 17, 2015","Truly amazing the recognizing of your likes and dislikes wish I was able to skip more tracks"
"November 22, 2015","Love listening to the different choices and music types that are available to mean Pandora."
"June 29, 2017","I love this app so much! But I'm confused, somehow I got Pandora Premium without paying for it?? I haven't been on the app for a week and I come back to have Pandora Premium. I didn't buy Premium prior to this and I'm not sure what's going on"
"December 12, 2016","Good"
"October 20, 2016","Hard to shut off"
"May 15, 2014","Am more interested in classical and ethnic.you have a lot of modern progressive....we old timers require varirty.....bluegrass,banjo,rhythm and blues,opera,new age,and many others...broaden the landscape!"

"October 11, 2016","I love my pandora!"
"March 29, 2016","I love Pandora, it gives me a variety of music to choose from."

"November 12, 2014","I love this for my tablet 5 stars there but it won't play on my phone which makes me sad :( if it would play there that would be awesome :) otherwise I love this app!"

"November 12, 2014","I just love this app! I grew up in the 80's, and listening to so many songs from that decade brings back so many memories! I'd definitely recommend everyone to get it!!"
"May 28, 2016","Wonderful variety of music & it's free! Love it!"
"May 14, 2015","I don't like that you can't find and play one song. Also all the adds can become annoying when your trying to jam out to some music."
"May 1, 2016","Works great, playlists for genres selected are spot on."
"October 1, 2015","works really well and is simple to use. no suscription needed. there is a free version w/ limited ads!"
"December 22, 2016","Pandora is easy to use, with sufficient features to create your own libraries of music based on specific categories, artist type and music genres via an endless supply of available audio material. The free version only requires you to listen to a brief commercial every so often which is great unless you can't spare a few seconds of your time."
"June 9, 2016","Could play more of selected artists material v"
"October 9, 2016","Love it! We use it on boat rides with a pair of Jam Plus speakers & in the car through the stereo. If we could make a Playlist of favorites it would be a five star app for us. The free version includes a lot of ads, but still a really great value."
"June 4, 2016","Great being able to hear just the music I like."
"June 22, 2016","Love music of all kinds and it is all there"

"September 13, 2016","Good Music sounds great."
"August 18, 2016","Freezing and constantly loads."
"April 25, 2014","This app reads your mind!!!! You have an unlimited number of stations to choose from and Pandora picks the perfect song every time!!! Besides, this app is free so what's the harm in getting this app anyways?"
"September 26, 2016","Place to be for music"
"March 30, 2014","Listening to what you prefer, with hardly any interruptions, what more can you ask for. HEY, I'm in the mood for ""Big bands"", or Andy Williams, Old blue eyes, style of music. It's MY selection. I like it."
"June 20, 2014","I truly enjoy this as the variety of music is huge, and it is very easy to navigate. Great for listening when reading, or just when I want to just have some music of different venues to listen to."

"February 9, 2014","I really thing it is awsome, to be able to listen just to the music I like. I can take my kindle to any room i go to and listen to what ever music i like. I even have certain songs i like to listen to for sleeping. Thanks"
"March 18, 2014","Not what I expected. I heard a lot of people talking about this app but I was not impressed. I used it for one week and haven't accessed it since. I wanted it to pick music for me. Not me telling it what to play."
"September 13, 2013","I listen to any kind of music with Pandora on the computer, tv or kindle. when you pick an artist they play similar selections of that style.. the options seem to be endless. can use Pandora on some cell phones too. no CD changing with Pandora."
"May 7, 2016","We love pandora! It is a must on each of our devices."

"August 3, 2014","Options! So many great options!"
"December 18, 2016","It is just like a box of chocolates. You never know what they will add to your station. You create a station with classical piano and soon u will be hearing Jerry Lee Lewis.Nothing against him but I guess you get the point. Another enervating thing is u turn on ur Pandora and go to work in the garage or yard and half an hour later the music stops, u go back in the house and u see a message from Pandora ""Are you still listening?"" WT#*%$??? And unless u get the paid version, u cannot do many editings (ie Liking or Disliking or FF a song). If u can put up with that, it's OK then."
"June 22, 2016","never bought this? I have used Pandora and I dont like it forces you to listen to music you didnt ask for"
"November 15, 2015","Too many commercial. Try Amazon prime! Multiple fast fwds, more channels, no commercials!"
"July 19, 2016","Couldn't keep it off when necessary!"
"December 30, 2012","I love music so I got this amazing app and now I never turn it off!! The best part is I can play whatever music I want. And I can search a artist and listen to the artist's songs or similar songs! I am in love with this radio. They even have music for your kids :) HOPE YOU LIKE IT TOO!!!!!"
"April 21, 2014","I love it no bad news just really fun just like radio station really good people who say it has problems it's probably some glitch on your device not because of app I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IT IS AMAZING"
"August 1, 2016","Great product, wonderful service."
"February 17, 2016","it is missing a few feature the web site has but it gets the job done."
"May 13, 2016","Pandora has gone super commercial and now even when paid for you can have advertisements. If you use the free version (as I have done since Pandora came out as an app) then prepare for at least 2 commercials every couple songs. I have had several ""song-commercialx2-song-commercialx2"" combinations. Pandora used to be all for it's listeners, now it's quite obvious that it's all for the $$$, of course."
"March 3, 2013","So glad this is an app on my Kindle. Transferring all my information from my computer, I can listen to the music I choose even when I'm not home. (kind of a bummer they need advertisements now and then, but I'll forgive them for the hours of pleasure the music gives in return :-)"
"April 1, 2016","Listen to Pandora on phone, computer and Kindle. Great."

"March 25, 2016","Seems to get buggy a lot, there's updates like every few weeks and probly 60% of the time I try to start it, it just goes to a black screen and my phone asks ""this app is not responding, do you want to close it or wait?"" When it works it's great, but sometimes I'd rather just go to youtube"
"July 9, 2015","I find the music selections much like iheart. I enjoy having both because I have a choice of which radio to listen to."
"May 12, 2016","It works ... just as well as my desktop version ..."

"July 14, 2016","not a fan of all the posting of adds"
"September 8, 2013","I love the way this music is presented. There is a nice variety of music and plus its free which is always nice in this economy to have some beautiful music in our lives to make us feel good since everything else is so expensive in today's world."
"May 16, 2014","Love this app. Its great music. The only bad thing about it is the ads, they only play like one ad every like 4 songs (more or less). So if u want free music then I recommend you definetly get this app"

"April 25, 2017","I enjoy listening to quiet tunes while reading a good mystery on my Kindle"
"June 8, 2014","I do listen to it daily and, what I like about it, the music is good, the sound is good and, I do not have to keep filling my own devices' memory by downloading my favorite songs and storing them."
"April 28, 2016","Great way to have a music library at your fingertips!"
"March 29, 2016","Great deal on FREE music. So it's worth the occasional ads."

"December 1, 2014","i like a lot a music i heard a lot of songs and comedies. someone go to search and type in ""starship troopers"" and u get asian comedian there helarious"
"January 5, 2015","I really don't like about this fee app is that there are commercials and you can not exit out of them, you have to listen to then until your songs resume."
"April 28, 2016","I thought I haf more free will with choices but am over all happy"
"November 15, 2016","not bad"

"October 7, 2016","App works great!"
"December 11, 2014","I love this app. You can play the music YOU want to hear. And if you get tired of that you just make a new station. It saves all your stations like play lists."
"July 31, 2013","Its great that you can just automatically have free music with one touch! Must have app!!! Pros: its free and there are never ending channels to choose from and you can save and bookmark them Cons: you can only skip six times but that's ok lol"
"April 9, 2013","Pandora is great, takes the brainwork or guesswork out of selecting music for enjoyment. I love it that I can set it and forget it. I play a mixture of my three stations that have three distinctly different genre, but it works for me. You can't find that on regular radio."
"August 8, 2015","Love the ad uninterrupted version of Pandora. Play at work--parties. Love the 80's. What has happened since!"
"April 18, 2016","It works and that's what's important.. and it was free."
"January 20, 2014","The only thing I don't like about Pandora is I have to be connected to Wifi to listen to it, so when we're travelling in the car I can't get service. Am I doing something wrong when I down load the songs and music I want?"
"October 1, 2013","Don't get me wrong. I love Pandora, it's a fantastic app And you listen to free music. After a while it stopped working though, it wouldn't open and I REALLY want to listen to music. I've just got i Heartradio and I hope it works better."
"December 1, 2013","This app. is great. You can listen to the music that you like and it will match other songs like it. Leaving you with your own type of radio station. You can like the song or dislike it it's just that simple. What more can you say."

"September 14, 2013","I love my Pandora stations. I get to chose the music I want to listen to. Suggestions are then made to compliment what I've chosen so I get a variety of artists, some of which I might never have known about. All music lovers should try this app!"

"June 21, 2014","This app is awesome and you can build your own stations. You can also listen to what you like. I get up in the morning and listen to it all day until I go to sleep. I luv this app!!!!!!!!!!! :)"
"February 9, 2014","The app works great. However, there are times when you can't load the app or it might just not let you log in. I found that using another app, exiting, and then coming back to Pandora usually works. A solid 4 / 5."
"February 11, 2015","This is a great music app. I have it on my kindle and my phone. The only thing that bothers me is the ads but they're not that long. I love it! :D"

"August 1, 2015","I've always loved Pandora, and have my own little for celebrity group that I usually click the ""shuffle"" or ""mix and match"" depending on what media I am using. I used it in the car, on trips, and it is wonderful to play through my large screen TV, app, and puts my music and only I like to the house. My son has the same hookups, but I would not even want to know what artists he has on his programming!"

"February 2, 2014","I love the music and would rate this five stars except for the fact that often the songs are not the original version. Being able to skip songs and indicate the ones you like are some of the reasons I like Pandora."

"September 21, 2016","Pandora is Awesome!"
"July 22, 2015","Would score higher but there are to many times when service drops and the bios for newer artists are not available"
"November 17, 2013","Love the variety and always am amazed at the incredible array of talent I hadn't been aware of. While I get to listen to music I know already love, it's even greater to learn about other talented musicians, singers, and songwriters."

"December 23, 2013","We use pandora everyday, all day , music brings joy to our lives, no matter what we are doing. Pandora makes it possible to hear only the songs you like, and introduces you to more!"

"November 20, 2013","Overall I love Pandora but, the new update is not great...the sleep timer is gone and its hard to navigate. Plus it now looks just weird, you can no longer just se the album cover...which is a small detail but still really annoys me"
"June 1, 2016","Love Pandora, just hate all the commercials."
"May 4, 2015","I really like using Pandora. I can listen to all the kinds of music I like without commercials. It's really good for use at work."
"August 27, 2013","Pandora gives you the opportunity to be able to listen to your kind of music just a special kind for a long time and then you want to you can switch to a whole new job I love it its great but it will eat up a lot of data on phone if you do not have a wifi connection and I mean a lot"

"December 2, 2016","I have just added Pandora to my applications on my 'smart phone' and highly value its service! I can now receive recommendations on other pieces of classical music without having to 'e-ask' and also without the knowledge to know what other 'pieces' mirror the favorite pieces I value such as Beethoven's 9th , the many piano pieces by Chopin and countless other treasures of the classical repertoire. It is a treasure in of itself. I would recommend it to any Amazon customer who is passionate about any kind of music! John Ebeling"
"August 10, 2015","Perfect. You can listen and sing and can be able to focus on homework or to rest with music in the background"
"July 4, 2016","Good music and not many commercial"
"May 3, 2014","I have tried a few of these kinds of apps, and I must say that this is the best one I have found. My search is finally over! Thanks Pandora for making this brilliant app. I would highly recommend this."
"July 18, 2016","I really like having Pandora on my tablet and my phone! It is like a mind reader that knows exactly what you like. I am still new at it, but I am still enjoying it very much! I like the option of skipping a song you do not like. I am still trying to figure this thing out! From what I understand for $.99 a day, you can do more ""skips."" For $.99 it is worth checking out!"
"July 17, 2016","Enjoy the options Pandora offers!"
"November 4, 2016","Great program. Free download but too may ads."
"May 16, 2016","excellent app. wished I had obtained it sooner!"
"December 1, 2013","Let us control our tablets that we paid for, this part of capitalism sucks. Fire is otherwise a great tablet, but maybe I didn't want to have Pandora forever."
"September 16, 2016","Love the selections"
"February 28, 2016","Easy selection process for different types of music. Great app."
"September 25, 2016","Don't care for it"
"February 27, 2015","Brings me back to old memories in my life through music. Time has flown...I remember turning 13 and the rest went so fast...(I'm 20...):"" )"
"November 26, 2012","There are not a whole lot of apps that I'll give a 5 star rating to. This however is one of the. If I've had installed for a few moths that must mean its good. This I've had for that time frame plus. It was free, it doesn't freeze up like other apps have so this gets my 5 Star Approval."
"February 9, 2016","The best app for music lovers... I Absolutely love music its bae. 😆"
"October 25, 2015","It is a great opportunity to hear the music you personally want to hear and easy to find it."
"October 8, 2016","I love pandora"
"December 27, 2015","A very good free music streaming app considering the commercial interruptions."
"May 23, 2014","This ""version"" plays way too many commercials. Not a fan of it. I have it on my ""smart TV"" and there are no commercials or very few..... Not here. There are tons of commercials."
"September 3, 2013","I can play in background while I play games on my Kindle Fire, and when I visit my kids/grandkids, I can take it with me. It:s so much easier than carrying around CDs! And I can pick what I like! It makes other media for music nearly obsolete!!!"
"July 21, 2015","The station always plays the music ask for. Plus they add additional musicians that play the same types of music."
"December 21, 2014","Of course I think this app will be on every device I own for life. I love Pandora and the new ai is really awesome with helping my mood throughout the day."
"September 15, 2016","Love this music app"

"September 19, 2016","Whats not to love?"
"February 4, 2016","This is great I love that u have many singers it's awesome 😀💙💙💙😝"
"May 30, 2015","I enjoy it. Makes a long work day go a little faster. A suggestion. You should offer a option when selected only plays that artist on a play list. Meaning if someone wants to hear Michael Jackson thats the only artist that plays. Thats one thing I don't like. When hearing the artist I selected, I really don't want to hear another artist mixed in with my selected artist. I think that would be a great option."
"February 4, 2016","Love to hear a lot of my oldies but at times Pandora just freezes up."
"May 27, 2014","Pandora seems like a nice radio station website, operable and clean. Thing is, it tends to assume about the music you enjoy and I'd say it's a 50/50 shot it'll be right. Can sometimes be annoying."
"March 15, 2016","I've been using Pandora for years now and I still love it!!!"
"February 21, 2014","I'm enjoying the music of my past so very much. Being a mature person, my tech skills are few and I find it difficult to find some of what I'd like to hear, because I've forgotten the artists' names, wish the selection process was less confusing."
"September 10, 2016","I enjoy it very much"
"February 17, 2016","Nice to have all my old friends traveling with me everywhere I go!"
"November 2, 2015","I love this app. I can customize it to fit whatever time of year, event, or mood I'm in."
"January 21, 2016","So many ads even when you upgrade. Song suggestions gets so repetitious."
"January 8, 2013","Couldn't make it through the day without Pandora! I log in to Pandora One which is commercial free and can't say I have any complaints about it! Even if they chose the same song rotation on certain stations, you have the ""I'm tired of this track option"" to update it. Love it!"
"December 18, 2016","Love it!"
"April 28, 2016","There are Renaissance and Medieval channels. Very cool."

"January 7, 2014","I like blues. I can get all kinds of blues and blues artists with Pandora. Sirius has one station devoted to blues. Also its free, can't beat that. I use in the car and when I drive for an hour or two I get at most one ad."

"November 27, 2016","ok"

"September 26, 2016","I love the music"
"July 10, 2014","I enjoy Pandora every day while I'm at work. I like the fact I can plug in one song, which can carry out continuous music the rest of the day. With an occasional commercial interruption."
"April 20, 2016","Too many ads. Too many artists not the one you want"
"October 13, 2016","love pandora"

"March 11, 2014","easy to install and Pandora offers wonderful music that you select according to your own taste. Would have purchased if it weren't free. Have this app on kindle and blu ray player and they work just the same."
"September 15, 2013","The best app I have ever used. Commercials are no big deal and the music is fantastic. I've pretty much stopped listening to music from my hard drive because the app is so easy to use and does a great job figuring out the music that I like."

"September 10, 2015","It's okay but it sucks that you can't look up i.e. specific song.. Only ones they consider 'similar'"
"April 11, 2014","songs not liked are played in full instead of being skipped alll together which makes you listen to a song you do not want on your playlist all the way through before moving on to the next one on shuffle"
"July 29, 2014","I have heard lots of good things about this app, so I finally got it.But after registering, it wouldn't let me listen to music for free.I do not recommend it for anyone with a tablet"
"June 17, 2016","Love Pandora. My favorite music station since they first came out. Love everything about Pandora, the ads do not bother me, better than listening to the junk on the radio. I like being able to have my own station, customize it, pause, play, skip like and thumbs down songs. Great app. its almost always on!"
"January 15, 2013","Pandora is a product that allows you to control what is played. It is good to have this after work to unwind. One word of caution, if you listen on the computer or your Kindle using a Hotspot, Pandora will use a lot of data. Don't be surprised if you have a larger bill than usual."

"July 30, 2015","This was my first experience of using a Music download-Great Experience!! Using my Kindle couldn't be easier!"
"March 29, 2016","The eye of the light is turned backwards on fold lenses"
"May 15, 2016","The kind of music I like, whenever I want it."
"December 19, 2012","I chose this radio because of its great diversity in music choice. Ive only used it a few times, but the artists available are aplenty. I do question wether or not one has to rate each song like other online radios, for the music to continue its playing. That gets a bit tedious."
"September 24, 2016","I like Pandora."
"November 29, 2015","Essential to my daily morning get-ready for school and my wind down after classes."
"January 30, 2014","Best music app created, love learning new artists and songs similar to what I already enjoy. Also finding songs I don't know the name of. Artist bio, information of the song, lyrics, and more are also very helpful."
"May 9, 2015","But I swear I'm so sick of Spanish adds it's the last thing I would like to hear and always makes me want to delete the app!!!"
"April 17, 2013","I would have gone with Grooveshark, but they don't have a kindle app for that. Anyway, this is pretty good after you figure it out. I'm definately discovering new songs under the genres I like to listen to."
"August 28, 2016","Love my gospel music!"
"August 21, 2015","BUT, you should be able to customize it to where you can choose to not play songs with explicit lyrics."
"July 15, 2016","Love it. Can't live without it!"
"September 23, 2016","Love the music."
"January 21, 2016","Didn't care for this app at all. Sorry, but it did not meet my needs."
"July 6, 2016","Pandora is my go to for music. :)"
"August 16, 2015","I love the variety of music, all of which I've picked, that I can listen to while working on my computer."
"June 5, 2016","Love the variety of music and it's FREE!"
"October 6, 2016","Great music."
"March 23, 2014","There is no problem with pandora except there are to many adds that keep popping up. If you also have that problem download iheartradioshack it doesn't have adds that always pop up it's better than pandora."
"July 9, 2013","Pandora is my all time favorite source of music. I love how it finds songs I like, even though I never knew before that I liked them. It uses a very interesting algorithm to discover music that you might enjoy rather than music that your friends enjoy."
"July 5, 2016","Love listening to music with this"
"August 9, 2016","Great selection of music."
"March 28, 2014","Love, love, love it! I grew up in the 60's and 70's, and have been listening to ""James Taylor Radio"" on my Kindle, ever since I signed up. It's absolutely wonderful!!! KLR in Fairview Park, Ohio"
"May 13, 2016","This is well worth the 5 bucks a month I pay."
"May 17, 2016","I can get so much music and such a variety."
"July 18, 2016","Has lived up to my expectation"
"August 9, 2016","Best free music anywhere."
"December 18, 2014","Too many ads unless you pay. which is the way of business. I use Google Play Music and have a pay subscription there because i can listen to whole albums"
"October 31, 2015","Can't complain. App works great. Ads are low and non instrusive. Will always keep using."
"September 22, 2016","Great listening"
"September 17, 2016","I love the music"
"May 17, 2016","Your choice of your favorite music any time'"
"May 7, 2015","Thanks to my son, I'm now into music again. You young people know how to do everything & now I'm caught in up. Thanks Pandora!"
"May 30, 2016","Cool games. Loads of fun! Gotta get more!"
"May 30, 2015","I like that Pandora uses your song selections to make a unique radio station for you. Also, it is great that it is free."
"August 9, 2014","Love Pandora. Loaded this when I had problems with the Slacker Radio download. Highly recommend this app if you like a mix of music and don't want to download tunes to your phone."
"October 8, 2015","Love it!!! I listen in English and Spanish songs. I was amazed by all the variety of music:)"
"March 27, 2014","Great music selections! I've been letting Pandora do the choosing rather than create my own playlists and it's been fine. The commercials are mildly intrusive, but can't complain since it's a free service."
"May 8, 2016","By far the best music service on the Internet."
"February 10, 2013","I could listen to Pandora all day, whatever mood you are in, you will get the music you need! I especially love when it takes me back with all my throwback jams! There are some occasional commercials but no big deal. If you want commercial free you can get Pandora One! Enjoy!"
"September 17, 2016","Just excellent !"
"September 26, 2016","Love this app."
"March 13, 2016","I just enjoy listening to my favorite music with this app."
"June 25, 2016","Love hearing all my old favorites!!"
"May 12, 2016","Love it Work is easier now. Thanks."
"July 26, 2016","Easy to install. Good music."
"April 21, 2015","i love pandora. Add vanilla ice as a channel and jam out to all relevent songs in that genre.. So i can practice my running man."
"September 21, 2016","Great listening"
"December 7, 2014","I really enjoy the stations that Pandora offers.I use the one that has advertisement. But really thinking of paying for the up grade without advertisement."
"September 18, 2012","The ability to hear my style of music anytime was the reason I got the Kindle Fire - and I am very happy that I did. I am not exactly gadget literate so I was pleased that Pandora is easy to use and the sound is very good as well. I've already read one book on my Kindle and enjoyed that as well."
"April 21, 2014","I use my Pandora App all the time. I can change the stations, shuffle them around for a different mix. It is very easy to use and I can set the tone for what I am doing with the music that is playing."
"October 12, 2016","Didnt work"
"April 19, 2016","Not enough customization for me. I prefer Spotify."
"March 3, 2015","I love that they put similar music on your station. I cannot always think of the songs I want to hear and it seems like they already know."
"October 12, 2016","Works good"
"September 28, 2015","It does not play all the way through. Keeps cutting out. Don't know what's wrong. Dissatisfied."
"July 30, 2015","Couldn't get it to load on my Kindle. Gave up and started playing music backed up from my Amazon Cloud... :("
"October 12, 2016","Don't know"
"January 31, 2016","Wonderful asset when listened to over my Bluetooth Bose FM receiver"
"October 11, 2016","Love music"
"June 26, 2015","Has every station ever invented its play music with no lag and no probloms once so ever. I RECOMEND it highly."
"January 4, 2016","Allows me to listen to Pandora on my Fire Tablet.  Works great!"
"July 11, 2016","How could you not love pandora!"
"March 17, 2013","I really like Pandora because you can type in a few names of the people/bands that you like, and it chooses songs that are quite similar to what you wanted. I would consider buying the non-advertisement one at some point.. but I do know how to work my volume controls!!"
"December 30, 2012","free music= awesome. you can make your own music station based on artist, genre, or even individual songs. You have a limited number of skips, though so use them wisely. I recommend making many stations of the same kind of music and switching between them to minimize on skip usage."
"September 6, 2013","I don't mind the commercials but wish it would stop asking if you want to download the free version Pandora One. I like the service otherwise, particularly because it includes lyrics for many songs and it learns what type of music you like."
"December 10, 2013","This was a pretty good app before this most recent update. Now, it won't load past the opening screen on my Kindle Fire. Tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling the program, but no luck. Fix and I'll change my review."
"September 26, 2015","Love Pandora. Like a station inside my head that picks music my soul is searching for, amazing!"
"October 6, 2016","works great"
"January 1, 2014","Great for listening to some of your favorite music. The ads do play in between songs if you are listening for awhile but it is still worth it. Lyrics are included, too, most of the time, and also a bio on the musician."
"July 27, 2016","Good cross of music genres."
"June 14, 2013","I am new to my kindlefire. I am just realizing that some items I can get on it cost money while they are running, as opposed to the books when once purchased do not require internet use. So since we have limited internet, I won't be able to use it much."
"February 2, 2016","Would be nice if I could keep some favorites to play back anytime."
"June 15, 2016","Like most of the music played"
"July 4, 2015","It's very easy to use. I get to choose the kind of music I want to listen to. I like everything about this app."
"October 22, 2015","It's ok, too many intruptions, of course if I had a paid subscription it might be better."
"July 15, 2013","Although this station has a wide variety of music to choose from and best of all, it's free, I only gave it 3 stars beccause it freezes/pauses quite a lot and sadly, you only get so many songs per month unless you upgrade,which imcludes a monthly fee."
"April 23, 2015","I love listening to Pandora! It plays the kind of music I want to hear, when I want to hear it with no commercial interruptions!"
"September 3, 2013","Pandora used to be great on my kindle fire until a few days ago it turned on fine but wouldent play music at all it gave me the option to play pause and like and dislike but it wouldn't play anything plz fix because you lost me as a customer"
"January 6, 2016","Works well on Apple products. Will just stop or not start on my Fire 7."
"April 12, 2015","I LOVE PANDORA!!!!!!! I love it because it's free and I listen to it every morning when I comb my hair,brush teeth! ITS WORTH IT!!"
"May 19, 2013","I have been listening to Pandora for about 8 months and I will continue. Great music and it is such a bonus to be able to create my own stations. I wish it was easier to place a song request but that is the only negative I have. The positives far outweigh!"
"January 25, 2014","I've never had a problem with Pandora. I use it at work, home, in the car, between multi devices. Would be five stars if they'd add the alarm clock to the kindle version. I charge this more reliably than my phone..."
"June 2, 2014","I think that Pandora is totally the best!!! Really hands down I can take anywhere and enjoy the music I enjoy, not what someone else has programmed! Best ever ,I am totally sold on Pandora :)"
"August 21, 2016","use it all the time ."
"July 21, 2016","Can always count on Pandora."
"December 28, 2013","I love this app- it gives me the choice to ONLY listen to music I enjoy and cuts out the music I don't want to hear while enabling me to mix multiple stations together & discover bands similar to the ones I already enjoy"
"April 15, 2016","Good quality app. Doesn't buffer throughout songs."
"March 5, 2013","Primarily designed to try before you buy. Limited options for listening Found this while trying to figure out how to use the kindle to meet my kids MP3 player needs. They weren't too impressed because of the limited number of times they could shuffle in a day."
"February 7, 2013","I love Pandora Radio!! I can play music to suit my mood or even change my mood. If I need a lift or need to calm down, I can change the music to suit me. I've discovered new music that I love and rediscovered music of my youth. I can't say enough good things about Pandora"
"July 21, 2015","Great except when I select an artist, it doesn't give me just that particular artist. I still like it a lot."
"January 22, 2016","Awesome, it's the best thing I have seen. I would choose it over TV!"
"November 16, 2015","This is a wonderful station where you can listen to any artist music that you wish."
"May 24, 2016","Neat app. Fun. Easy to use, and download."
"November 18, 2015","I love Pandora, and I probably listen to it at least 6 hours a day. However, there are 2 problems with the app that I have. First of all, the app used to display the song and artist as well as a pause button in the drop down tool bar on the Kindle Fire. It would be nice to have that back. This way I don't need to be in Pandora to see what song or artist it is. Second, when the stations are on shuffle, it doesn't say which station the song currently playing is coming from. This is a problem because I can't like or dislike songs for fear of them being on the wrong station. Other than thos two complaints,the Pandora app is awesome!"
"July 29, 2016","Great addition to my FIRE!"
"September 6, 2014","Pretty good music box, as i call it. Can't really understand how to chose music that I like. Very interesting because I really like music. And I like all styles of music."
"October 3, 2016","I like it !"
"May 22, 2014","Downloaded it twice and the application repeatedly fails on my LG Android phone. Don't waste our time on this app"
"July 21, 2013","This is awesome! It was recommended by a friend. He always has me listen to new artists and I asked how he found that he liked them and he said Pandora. Apparently it will play artists comparable to the artists you choose to listen to. Great radio!"
"October 15, 2013","It takes a while to load, but it uses less battery power then if I play the music that is loaded onto the device. Has a good shuffle, but can get stuck on a genre for a while, but its music that I like so I'm not bothered by it."
"October 11, 2016","Excellent"
"March 15, 2016","I have only been using Pandora for a week but I love it."
"July 15, 2016","THEYPLAY ALL THE RIGHT STUFF."
"June 14, 2016","It's great loads of fun to listen to"
"October 6, 2016","I love it."
"June 25, 2014","Downloaded it for my BlackBerry Q10, works like a charm and automatically syncs with my Bose SoundLink at the house for hours of jazz, reggae and afrobeat music whilst I get things done."
"May 14, 2016","It seemed to know what songs I would enjoy."
"May 5, 2016","Great service. I now use Google Play however."
"July 19, 2015","I can't begin to tell you what this app provides me with on a day-to-day basis as I'm riding along in my car."
"December 2, 2016","Pandora is The Best! Great selection of music. Always there when you need it. I'm able to stream wherever I go. I had Sirus for a short time and it was terrible. It would cut in and out and wasn't reliable. Pandora is always there and has a selection for what ever mood I'm in. Thanks Pandora! Love You!"
"June 6, 2015","I've tried multiple times to register for free but it won't let me! Fix this or else nobody will try this app. Please!"
"December 7, 2015","So worth paying for no commercials and uninterrupted music. Love pandora 💚💚"
"February 23, 2016","Keeps freezing and won't open. Now it won't show any the stations"
"March 15, 2015","The variety of music is outstanding - I don't even mind the advertising - if you listen to regular radio, they too have commercials !!!"
"September 18, 2016","Love the music"
"May 31, 2016","OUTSTANDING!!! Love all the choices !!!"
"June 17, 2015","love my Pandora"
"August 29, 2015","Pandora is perfect for me to listen to music that I love, like pop, country, and R&B, and I love it!"
"October 1, 2016","great music"
"January 21, 2014","I listen to this all day and every day. You can choose what kind of music u want 2 listen to and theirs no end to the choices. It's clear AND I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS. TRUST ME. 100 STARS."
"December 18, 2014","Just got it on my new phone and it works great for my spin class. I can pick what I like and don't have to listen to what other people like. Love it."
"January 20, 2016","Great app. Learns your music taste and suggests music you will like."
"June 13, 2016","it is really good music to listen to"
"June 27, 2012","its nice, but not as nice as the PC version. you can't view lyrics on the app, and the ads are completely too much. the functionality to do other things is nice though. I'm listening as I type now. and you can get to it in the notices button on the KF just like if you were playing music out of your library."
"September 13, 2016","Good, Thank you"
"November 4, 2015","I have been a fan of Pandora for years it still is my favorite of all the music apps."
"May 30, 2016","Works great. Nice to have by the pool."
"December 28, 2015","It is a good music app but you are limited to how many times you can skip"
"July 17, 2016","I was not allowed to sign in"
"October 17, 2016","love it"
"December 5, 2012","I love the idea of pandora but this app doesn't work correctly. Every time I accidentally touch it, it starts playing music really loudly. However, when I WANT it to play music, i.e. I click it on purpose... it doesn't begin to play for 30 minutes. They need to work out the glitches."
"October 13, 2016","LOVE IT."
"January 8, 2014","My beef with internet radio stations is variable audio levels. iHeart, Hardradio.com or Pandora....they all have audio that will vary a lot.  Other than that...Pandora's ok - kind of standard - does the job."
"December 1, 2014","Honestly it's a good app for music. But...... it does have its flaws. It might stop or daddy forward to another song. But other than that it's awesome!!!"
"June 7, 2016","It's so much fun with so much variety"
"April 19, 2016","I like pandora listening to all the songs I like"
"May 29, 2016","Much of the time I can't get reception!"
"May 24, 2016","Great access to various genres of music!"
"February 13, 2013","Really like listening to it. I inadvertently hit the dislike button on a song that I really love and now I dont know how to request it back on there or undo what I did. I was trying to get my volume bar up and hit dislike by mistake!!! Especially love it at Christmas time."
"November 7, 2015","I really enjoyed my new Pandora app , i have.been enjoyi great music with my family."
"October 29, 2015","It doesn't always. Play songs that are related to the person/song the radio is about."
"December 3, 2013","It is the best out there have just what you want to hear !!!!!!!!!GREAT!!!!!!! I have it on all the time in the house are in the shop are in the car!!!!!"
"March 2, 2015","Best internet radio app ever. I've been using Pandora forever and I love love love it! Nothing better at showing me some awesome music!"
"August 16, 2016","Pandora is awesome!!!"
"March 2, 2016","Great music but you can't necessarily pick specific music."
"April 5, 2015","Best ever, its like having a private DJ, amazing continuous music!1 you honestly couldn't pick them yourself this well....luv it!"
"October 6, 2014","It's awesome in all but it's the adds and that dang Barbara comstock add too and don't bring guns to bars . Really don't you don't want a drunk shooting anyone."
"February 4, 2016","I love it, easy to use, and I can listen to what I want to hear."
"October 15, 2013","I have had to delete and redownload this app multiple times and it is still not quite working properly. I get to enjoy maybe a few songs before it won't work again."
"March 28, 2014","I used to listen to Pandora exclusively, but when they changed the listening practices (and then changed them back) I was totally over them and no longer use their service. It was good while it lasted."
"July 2, 2013","I liked this app although when listening to the songs, the ending of the songs got cut off for some reason. I don't mind it that much that you need the internet to access it, and Pandora has expanded a lot although it could expand to greater heights."
"July 15, 2016","the best for smooth jazz !!!"
"October 7, 2016","Great app"
"July 11, 2016","I absolutely love Pandora!!!!"
"December 3, 2015","Actually, no stars, pandora would not let me register. went to iheart instead."
"April 4, 2015","I have used Pandora for about 3 years on computer. I had not looked for an app for my phone. I am very happy Amazon suggested it!"
"June 10, 2015","This doesn't even work don't get this ignore all the good review this does not work on kindle fire DONT GET THIS!!!!"
"January 5, 2014","I can get pretty much whatever kind of music I want, and I like alot of foreign and exotic types along with classical, all kinds of jazz, blues, oldies, I can go on and on. All in all I'm very pleased with Pandora!!"
"March 10, 2016","Pandora has always been my favorite music streaming app."
"January 8, 2013","Example: I just created a Les Miserable station. Now I'm having to listen to unrelated music because it morphed into including non Les Miz music. I understand the need to incorporate other titles, but those other titles then bring in other unrelated music to the original topic."
"May 13, 2016","Love my Pandora. I listen to it every day."
"April 17, 2016","Great music, nice assortment of artist and songs"
"March 19, 2014","Complicated to use and hard to enjoy the cost for everything...another money maker on an item noted as FREE! JUST LIKE THIS IS!"
"July 24, 2013","I have been listening to Pandora for years. I started paying a membership two years ago because I wanted complete ad free listening. I have it on my smart phone so I can use it in the car and at work. I haven't bought a CD in years. Why should I?"
"July 5, 2016","It works exactly as I expected"
"January 20, 2016","Excellent. Exciting. Extremely reliable to play my gender of music."
"February 27, 2015","This app is awesome it has the newest and oldest music and the always play great songs the on my thing wrong with it is the advertisement"
"January 26, 2014","no reason to pay for a subscription to Sirius or XM since this can be used through bluetooth in your car or plug your phone into your stereo. There are so many different stations just make up what you want to hear"
"April 25, 2016","the More you use it the better its choices get"
"June 12, 2013","I can't really rate it because I haven't been able to get it to work. It sits there and acts like it is loading....and loading.....and loading. Then nothing happens. I will try it again to see if I can get it to work, if not then it comes off my tablet."
"October 9, 2016","no stars"
"March 4, 2016","I love this app and now with thumbprint it's even better."
"October 14, 2016","Awesome"
"June 23, 2015","Really iffy quality, repetative playlists, and freezes CONSTANTLY. I only use because Slacker always freezes too."
"September 13, 2016","Really like it"
"July 4, 2015","The only thing that would be better is if there were no commercials and free! Alan Jackson radio, highly rated!"
"May 17, 2016","Love it and it works great on my fire hd7"
"July 13, 2015","I really love this, I can listen to the groups and people I really enjoy with no commercials. such a joy!!!!!"
"September 17, 2016","Love Pandora!"
"November 4, 2015","Its a good app but with spotify now, there is no real reason to use this ever again."
"May 11, 2015","Enjoy the app! Have only used the free version. Even with the ads ( about every 3 or 4 songs) it is better than the radio!"
"May 9, 2017","The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best Seriously, though this is an awesome application that helps me through my workouts and my rough days. The variety of music never lets a day get stale and I even sneak these on during my 12 hour work days. The premium version disables ads and at least on the home version gives you higher quality audio. Audio quality is not noticeable on earbuds or low quality headphones, don't worry about that too much."
"September 22, 2016","Too many ads"
"July 17, 2016","Love Pandora!!! Great APP!!"
"May 12, 2013","I couldn't even get into it because it wouldn't let me in then I double checked my password and user name and it was correct and then I got on my computer and typed it in and it was perfectly fine."
"July 26, 2016","I like the range of music"
"June 29, 2016","It's nice to have a dance party"
"January 2, 2014","I haven't really used this app yet, but my husband absolutely LOVES it. You can pick your artists that you like and then it will recommend music from what you've liked. You can make your own ""radio stations"" and you can download the whole album, not just certain songs. It also puts them into categories, which I like (country, alternative, etc.) For example, in his country, he has the ""Lee Brice"" station, his rap the ""Eminem"" station, etc. And then your music will play in the background while you do whatever else you want on your tablet - check e-mails, facebook, play games, etc."
"October 4, 2016","the best!"
"February 28, 2016","Great app.  As good as it always was. Five Stars"
"January 27, 2016","I like how I can choose my favorite music and can listen anytime."
"February 20, 2014","I really like Pandora, but not sure if its Pandora or my Kindle, but the song will start to play then stop and then start again. There is a pause in the middle of the song, it reminds me of my CD's skipping."
"September 5, 2015","I love Pandora -at home, and work. It allows everyone in my family to hear their favorite music."
"September 6, 2014","I was litsening to the music and all the sudden it stopped! IT SAID I NEEDEE TO BUY A F***ING FULL VERSION TO CONTINUE! Don't waste your time on this and get Iheartradio!"
"December 22, 2015","Love this app. Easy to sign in, easy to switch between stations. Happy."
"June 28, 2015","Great for music on the patio. I use the Shuffle format with my favorite channels so there's a nice mix of music."
"October 30, 2016","Eh."
"August 25, 2016","Didn't work right."
"September 7, 2016","I LOVE THIS APP"
"June 20, 2016","Personalized you favorite artists"
"June 24, 2016","The best music library on Earth."
"April 20, 2015","It's ok the only thing is if you want commercial free music you'll have to pay a subscription $4.99 for no commercials a month"
"January 18, 2014","i like being able to think out loud about my favorite music of all types. I would like it to play as I go elsewhere on the computer.  I wish you included opera. I like full recordings of classical music"
"January 1, 2014","This service rocks, and it is free. Sure, you get some commercials here and there but it's free. If that drives you crazy it is cheap to get them removed. I have tried other music apps and always come back to Pandora."
"March 2, 2016","so far I'm enjoying my favorite tunes...great selections."

"June 9, 2016","Like having your own radio station."
"May 1, 2013","I've loved Pandora for a long time - I will never lose my music because it has it's own web site, so when I had to replace my computer, I had immediate access to Pandora. Then I got a Kindle for Christmas ... and Pandora is just a click away. It's delightful."
"January 2, 2015","A lot of commercials but I should expect that from a free music player. Love the app. I use it probably twice a day to listen to good, free music."
"April 22, 2014","Pandora radio station is totally awesome. I just love my personal picks. I listen to it everyday. And they're relaxation music puts me to sleep every night after a long and busy and stressful day."

"May 26, 2016","Too many adds cant find specific songs"
"January 20, 2014","The variety and quality of the selections in any category combined with an ability to delete any selections which do not comport with the style and color desired make Pandora a unique venue for listening pleasure."
"May 24, 2013","Downloaded right to my Parrot Asteroid. No problems. I'm so happy with my Parrot and Amazon! Not as many or much information as on my iPhone Pandora. I pay for Pandora that how much I love this thing. No commercials woo! Cant wait to down load more apps."
"March 9, 2014","This is a by far the best app that I have on my kindle. I listen to the Pandora app every day! I had Pandora on my computer but I can now have it wherever I go! Love the music's that I have on my station."
"June 8, 2016","Like most of what they play on here"
"November 30, 2013","I love it! I love one direction and now I can listen to bands that is similar to one direction and 5SOS. AND ITS ALL FREE AND PORTABLE!! I recommend this to people that love music and free stuff. Love it! U should get it!"
"August 26, 2016","Just like it alot"
"September 17, 2016","Great system"
"July 10, 2013","User-friendly, on-line entertainment that certainly satisfies my far ranging tastes in music, musicians and entertainers. Pandora offers instant access to pleasure to all ages of listeners with a seemingly endless supply of performers and titles."

"December 21, 2015","It is so good it's just that I have to lesion to other music besides the one I want"
"December 13, 2012","I love Pandora on my laptop, and now I love it on my Fire HD, too! It works great, but be warned that there are way more (visual) ads on the tablet than on the PC version. At least, that's the way that it seems, but perhaps this has something to do with the much smaller screen. I can certainly forgive these ads, however, since the radio stations that Pandora creates for me are so fun to listen to, and they need to make their money some way. If I grow tired of the ads, I can always upgrade my Pandora account, so as to eliminate them for a fee. However, I don't spend that much time even looking at the tablet when this app is in use- and as a nice bonus, the display darkens after the app has been running for some time, so as to conserve battery power (the speakers will still play the music, of course, and the app continues to run)."
"July 25, 2016","Don't like wouldn't work"
"February 3, 2014","I like the variety, the fact that you can ""like"" or ""dislike"" a particular song, and the overall performance. The occasional interuptions for a message are not that frequent and I like that too."
"July 3, 2016","No review,just a bomb ass app"
"May 11, 2016","The music is great. Excellent selections."
"September 29, 2016","Love Pandora. It's a great way to listen to different kinds of music that harmonise with one's nerve strings. It's a good starting place to get basic info about the composer and musician(s). Some of the choices will even inspire to shell out the cash for a more permanent option.  The free version is financed by ads, but they are not too oppressive, and, after all, this is primarily a music outlet. However, when the audio ads come on, pressing the Mute button for a 5-count of ""Mississippi One..."" takes care of that."
"June 16, 2015","It is bad because i have been trying to sign up and it gets out of pandora and goes to the front page of my phone"
"July 10, 2014","yea party there is royal people and royal gowns and. lots of tea cups and sicurity guards and you can have a long list to do anything for somebody and to make that person special"
"December 25, 2013","It plays one song and then crashes. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. It does not change stations either. I am taking it tomorrow to use on a different network and will update this review if anything changes."
"July 31, 2014","The best thing that has ever happened to me I can't thank you enough , without pandora I would have literally nobody or nothing it's my best friend and my upper when I'm down:)"
"June 6, 2016","It's a great music source for free!"
"October 14, 2015","I'm so wondering does this app &#34;Pandora&#34; have to have WiFi to work? Hmm"
"June 26, 2013","Love the Pandora app, I can hear music all day from my kindle. It is very simple to download and use, definitely recommend it."
"December 2, 2013","I love it and thinking seriously about doing the upgrade. I like it because you do offer it free with limited commercials. You get to choose what you like to hear and its easy to navigate around I love it at work at home."

"February 23, 2017","I don't know how I got along before Pandora. Mu husband and I listen to it all the time. I wish someone would come out with a radio that played Pandora music directly from Pandora. My husband is in a nursing home and would love to be able to listen to Pandora using one simple device that was not likely to be stolen."
"August 1, 2016","Great deal on Pandora!"
"September 25, 2015","Thought I already had it on my phone, but I did add it now. Great to listen to what I want."
"September 30, 2013","I wish I had unlimited listening on this, if I did I would use it more. As it is, I use up my time, switch to one of the other freebies, and then forget to switch back. So I only listen now and then. (Advertisers are you listening?)"

"August 18, 2016","it is fantastic !!"
"April 29, 2013","Pandora is an AMAZING app that I just can't help but love. It plays all the latest hits and even plays a few of the olds. Not to mention that it has so many stations and you can even add some so I get my country music while me mom can jam to her rock n roll."

"March 26, 2013","It Nice really nice but if your one of those people who are always falling asleep while listening to the music you only have 40 hours or something to listen every month . If you get this just use it for daytime it's much better so you don't have to be worried about your time limit"
"August 28, 2015","Pandora is a great station. The music selections could not be better if I had chosen them myself."
"February 20, 2014","I really enjoy listening to old style country music and this is a great way to hear what I like. Sometimes I listen to 60s, other times 70s, 80s or 90s. Sometimes I hit the shuffle feature and hear it all."

"February 27, 2016","I love the music selection, and the ease of operation 😎"
"May 3, 2013","I love listening to Christian music while I am searching the net or playing games. I would highly recommend this."

"April 17, 2016","Super slow don't like it needs to be upgraded"
"December 2, 2015","My son loves that he can listen to music on a constant basis with this app."
"February 16, 2014","This app is okay but I don't like how you have no idea what song is going to be played next. I think that Pandora should only have the songs from an artist on their station and that's it, no random singers."
"July 23, 2016","free personalized music"
"July 19, 2016","So far I really like it."
"May 5, 2013","I like the fact that I can ""add"" music to a genera or artist and can pick my own artist to shuffle in that mix. I have always like Pandora and am considering the upgrade to omit the adds. They are not bothersome, but sometimes you just want music."
"August 15, 2015","I love this program because it gives me the opportunity to hear all the music I enjoy listening to."
"January 11, 2015","Great app, but have become annoyed with pandora, if you don't upgrade, every other song will be followed by an add and has tons of pop-up adds"

"August 31, 2016","Great product."
"March 28, 2015","I love Pandora! I listen to it all the time. I love that I can create my own playlist by genre or artist. Nothing bad to say."

"March 29, 2016","I love Pandora now I can have it where ever I go"
"December 24, 2014","It works fine, but it didn't sync to my regular Pandora account for some reason. I haven't really figured out so far how to set up new stations."
"May 19, 2014","Pandora radio customizes the radio to suit individual taste. Occasionally an ad is aired to interrupt listening pleasure, but it is tolerable after hearing the artists and songs preferred."
"November 26, 2015","Perfect!"
"January 4, 2016","I love this, play it at night especially when hard to get to sleep."
"January 10, 2014","The Pandora was inserted on my Kindle Fire HD and produced a great variety and outstanding collection of titles as well as variety. I can read and enjoy the music at the same time. Great for multi-tasking!"

"July 30, 2014","I love it. It's just that you can't search songs. Why not? Can't you search songs and in that station other songs like that will come up too? I just think it would be easier."
"July 24, 2016","I really enjoy Pandora"
"October 23, 2015","This is a great app that serves the purpose of playing my favorite artist stations."
"January 21, 2016","Even with a subscription, the quantity of skips is too limited!"
"December 28, 2014","I love it. it enables to manage what I listen to. I am very fond of fiolk music from the 1960's andhave found many artists I wasnot aware of."
"January 16, 2013","This is an app that is versatile and will appeal to all taste. Any venue of music your desire is available at your fingertips!"
"September 3, 2014","Pandora is fantastic!!! We have it on our TV, as well as our computers. Listen to it all day without interuptions since we joined. Do it, you won't be disappointed."

"August 18, 2016","I love the music"
"April 27, 2013","Works just fine, had no problems with the streaming, and sound quality was good. Good user interface. I don't use it too often, but if you're looking for a way to discover new music Pandora is a very good option. For free users the ads are very reasonable."
"July 31, 2016","Too much information"
"January 29, 2014","Pandora is great. You are in complete control of what you hear without the cost. And once it learns what your tastes are it does a wonderful job of predicting what you will want to hear. Praise for Pandora!"

"January 16, 2013","Free music, you gotta love that, huh? Ads on this incarnation of Pandora are sometimes annoying, because they interrupt music play for audible advertisements, and not just visual ads(sometimes both). I gave it five stars even with some annoyances because it is free, hello, it's free. Pay $4 a month or so for no ads is the other option.  Try it out!!"

"June 20, 2013","I like Pandora in most of it's varying forms across platforms. but this particular format is quite nice. I enjoy having quick access to lyrics and an easy ""thumbs up/down"" function. The sound quality on my Kindle Fire HD is pretty good too."
"August 11, 2016","I love Pandora"
"January 2, 2014","Ive been using pandora for awhile, works great. Theyve added a bit more commercials but its still way better than the radio. I love the shuffle button to randomly go through each of your stations. Works great."

"September 11, 2016","Love Pandora.... It is great to get the monthly membership so you can play songs for four hours uninterrupted.

"April 28, 2017","Unfortunately not a lot of time to just sit and listen as of yet. Company from out of state arrived so that meant trips that took me away from totally listening to music and actually getting all of my likes and dislikes registered. I hope to have time very soon to enjoy all that Pandora will provide. Had just enough time to know I will really enjoy it and I am really looking forward to having more listening time now that company has departed.

"October 26, 2013","There isn't much to say that hasn't been said by anyone else. It's a great way to listen to your favorite music, as well as discover artists that you have never heard before that play the same genres of music you enjoy."
"May 31, 2015","Great station. Love the variety which is good for work environment as well as relaxing at home. Keep adding."
"July 24, 2016","Doing a good job"
"June 30, 2015","I love it because it's just like the real thing. If you like music this is the app for you!!!!7777777"

"August 19, 2016","Good music"
"May 14, 2016","Its good to listen claasic music"
"March 29, 2014","Kids stuff all puffed up like a personal juke box kind of software which it might be if you continue to pay or whatever else you have to do. What it is NOT is a pleasant listening experience."
"September 25, 2015","I really enjoy having this. It's so nice to be able to listen to all music I llike."
"July 9, 2015","A better playlist n too many interruptions. I would not pay for the upgrade with no better playlist."
"July 23, 2016","It's pretty good"
"August 10, 2016","Love pandora"
"October 7, 2013","This App only works half of the time. Sometimes I have to shut down my kindle just for it to work. I don't like that you only have a specific number of times that you can skip songs. That's why I rated it with three stars."
"March 7, 2014","Love Pandora for any genre, any day, anytime. No Matter what my mood from spiritual to my country roots or just a stroll down memory lane, I can find it and hear it all on Pandora."
"July 23, 2016","Can't pick song."
"December 29, 2012","Pandora has an excellent variety of music and continues to provide customer satisfaction every time. It offers an opportunity to skip songs that you prefer not to hear. I personally think they have a good selection of zumba/spanish music on the Don Omar radio station."
"July 28, 2014","Pandora is one of my favorite chill-out stations. I enjoy being able to like a song."
"February 16, 2016","Does not load music very often. Plays sporadically."
"May 9, 2016","I love the variety of latin music"
"May 18, 2016","Love getting my favorite music."
"February 2, 2016","Great App for music as long as you have wi-fi or data."
"December 6, 2015","I love my Pandora it so great, not sure what I would do without it,"
"October 21, 2014","its pretty awesome u don't have to turn off what u were doing because it will play a song that might be from the same artist if I were u I would get it"
"July 31, 2015","I love Pandora. Ads are short and far between. No talking dj's, just music by artists I select."
"October 17, 2013","I love that I get music that I like that I can tailor to the situation. They also have some great picks that I had not heard of. Great music and perfect for reading, sewing or any other activity that you have going on."
"March 27, 2014","Really like Pandora radio. I PAY the yearly fee for pandora one, commercial free version. It has a better sound and no limit on how much you can listen. Worth every penny. I'm very satisfied."
"May 24, 2014","Well you can hear the music fine but what I don't like is that I can't search a song for it to play. It also needs to have a loop button so you can listen to a song more than once."
"August 22, 2016","thank you"
"January 3, 2014","I've been using Pandora practically since it first started. I remember the carefree days before the advent of advertising on it. Advertising is annoying, but life is business and if you cannot turn a profit you cannot stay alive.  While you do tend to have to turn down as many or more songs you don't like as you find songs you DO like... You lose the ones you dislike very quickly, and you can keep track of the ones you do practically forever, it still works out in your favor most of the time."
"March 4, 2016","Works perfect. No issues. Highly recommended."
"February 11, 2013","Always user friendly. Wonderful music I couldn't choose it so well for myself if I tried. Pandora introduces me to new artists and songs, and I soon becoming a great fan and end up purchasing their music as well. Pandora truly is background music for your life!"
"December 10, 2014","Pandora is my go to for music when on road trips or working out. Pandora One is well worth the price for ad free and interruption free music."
"April 5, 2013","Great music,but it has a very generic feel to it. I feel iheart has more features I like.The only reason I have Pandora is because iheart crashed on me and I couldn't get it up back and running."
"June 21, 2016","Met all expectations!!!"
"June 21, 2016","Good but not that good."
"February 27, 2016","I love Pandora and I'm fiercely loyal to the service. Actually offered to make a donation when I first discovered it a couple years ago - they thanked me and suggested I subscribe (didn't know about they offered a subscription service). The staff went without pay for a time early on until Pandora received their first round of venture funding. Best part about Pandora is the opportunity to discover new talent (some don't even have bios yet) or established artists you've never listed to. Maybe Pandora's competitors offer something like this - don't know, don't care. It's Pandora for me."
"April 15, 2016","Yes. I love the great selection......"
"January 14, 2014","Great alternative 2 radio and a great variety of music, and especially the ability 2 customize your stations. Been listening 4 years and I still use Pandora all the time on countless devices. Top notch!!!"
"May 18, 2015","This app is pretty good but it sometimes kicks me out of the app. Also it let's you listen to the latest music"
"July 17, 2016","Love the options​"
"November 16, 2015","Its really nice, easy to use and bunch of songs bt several categories.."

"February 15, 2014","Definitily 5 stars! Great app that downloads easily. Gives you access to all types of music and artists. Once you select the artist or genre Pandora does the rest. No problems at all with this app!"
"July 24, 2014","I enjoy joy listening to the different genre Pandora offers. It's great for my granddaughters as well, we play princess music when we are playing with their princesses."
"November 25, 2015","If you love music, you'll love Pandora! One issue: I love it too much"
"November 20, 2015","This app is great so if you want it's not a waste in buying it"
"October 15, 2014","The best music app. You choose the era or type of music you like and listen to particular artists and their contemporaries without the annoying radio announcer and ads. Includes an image of the album cover and you can also view the lyrics to each song. Rate the songs so Pandora learns what your interests are. Great!"
"March 29, 2016","Like a lot. Lots of music to choose from"
"January 2, 2015","Works very well, only wish my Playstation 3 had app for it. We pay the 36 dollars a year. Good variety of music and plenty of good mix."
"July 16, 2016","Very good tankyou"
"March 24, 2014","it doesnt get much simpler thas this folks type in a song or group or even a genre and bang u got it and it also gives recomendations based on your tastes. the more you use the more you get ."

"September 9, 2013","I had this app before,about 5 to 6 months ago,but now it won't work. I open the app and it just puts me at the loading screen and nothing else,I waited about 10 minutes and it didn't work. Please fix this,thanks for listening."
"October 18, 2015","I have used Pandora before but this edition will not cover music or connect."
"June 19, 2015","I LOVE PANDORA ONE!!!!!!! I would of given them 4 stars, but they need to add more selections of music."
"May 23, 2016","Love this app. Easy to set up"
"August 6, 2015","I don't really use this much. We got it for kids' songs since we babysit for our grandchild."
"April 13, 2016","I love my pandora.... It's my favorite"
"January 30, 2013","I rarely turn on the radio anymore so it's great to be able to have exactly what I'm looking for on Pandora. Aside from the occasional ad, nice to find World Music or age-appropriate music on demand based on an artist or genre I like. Comes through clear, also."
"September 10, 2016","Like"
"January 18, 2013","Lost my good jazz stations on the radio years ago. Pandora brings it all back. I don't even mind the commercials. After all, I had them on the radio. Didn't I?"

"May 31, 2016","Love this and use it a lot."
"July 4, 2013","So far the free app is great, I have no problems with loading, but just like a radio station same song repeated more variety. I use at work for music for about 8 hour shift. But I would recommend to anyone that does not have a radio app."
"July 22, 2016","Love my Pandora"
"July 17, 2016","I've been using Pandora for quite a long time and I'm very happy with it. Sometimes it can be difficult to get this app to open, the music won't play. I can get it to work if I close then re-open it."
"May 26, 2016","Great Internet Radio Station"
"February 6, 2016","Love it! It's easy to use. Great selection of songs."
"February 20, 2015","Pandora gives a great variety of artist and up to date music commercial free that Any and everyone who enjoys music would love."

"August 26, 2016","Like it"
"August 13, 2016","Love music"
"August 7, 2013","Music at my fingertips Christian, Smooth Jazz, R&B. It's all good with bios of the artist learning much about their background and Pandora can be put on many different media receptors. I have it on my laptop and Kindle...thanks!"
"November 25, 2014","If this is a referral for Pandora by Anne Rice, then I definitely give it 5 stars. Pandora describes the life of a Roman woman of the upper class 2000 years ago. It is thorough in her descriptions both of women and and the soldiers of Caesar's armies. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Pandora is one of Anne's vampire books but like all her vampire books, the characters are much more than just vampires and she develops them so that the reader sees them as human as well as vampire with the human still dominating their lives as they struggle with their new identities."
"June 13, 2014","I love Pandora. It lets me select from many favorites, I especially like the songs from the 60's 70's. The best part is that I can play it on my smart phone with ear plugs."
"April 19, 2016","I am able to pick listening choices."
"October 15, 2015","I enjoy this app as well and all the different kinds of music I can listen to"
"February 23, 2016","I have been using Pandora for years now. I listen to it at work and home. One word of caution - even though it may say ""music for work"" be aware that it does not filter out all songs that have profanity. It may be considered mild but it depends on your setting. I would not use ""music for work"" if it was an educational setting even in an office. But that's just my opinion- I was so surprised to hear curse words on that station and quickly turned the volume down. Pandora offers plenty of options that everyone can find something that makes them happy to listen to."
"April 10, 2014","Unless you pay a small amount each month to remove commercials, you will be stuck with a lot of advertisements!"
"July 3, 2016","Love Pandora radio!"
"February 20, 2014","it is so nice to o be able to listen to they types of songs I choose to listen to vs. having to have the total mix for everyone's listening pleasures. I have the app on my iPhone, Kindle and iPad."
"December 13, 2014","well i accidentally fell asleep with it on then wpke up snd tried to use it and it didnt work just showed a ad and it didnt work please fix"
"April 12, 2013","I've always loved using Pandora whether on my phone or now on the tablet. It's easier than turning on my computer and free. My only qualm is I know if I don't pay $3.99/month, at some point, I won't be able to listen to music anymore for the month."
"June 6, 2016","Love to listen to Pandora"
"December 3, 2015","Great mixture of all the types of music that I enjoy listening to."
"February 3, 2016","Totally awesome and free can't get any better than that"
"February 4, 2016","I absolutely enjoy it and have for years. Thank you!"
"January 28, 2014","Like the capability to build many different ""stations"" and then approve the music they eventually will play. Provides enough new content to expose you to artists you may not have listened to."
"September 15, 2016","ok"
"March 24, 2016","I enjoy being able to customize my music!"
"May 21, 2014","I know that I am kind of late to the Pandora thing but better late than never. I really love this app. The shorts ads that came on between every fews songs don't even bother me."
"August 24, 2016","Love it"
"June 1, 2016","Excellent and easy to use."
"May 14, 2016","Love it listen to all the time"
"December 2, 2015","Love it! It's great for when I don't know what songs to listen to."
"November 22, 2013","Works great on my phone, but unfortunately just get a blue screen on my kindle. :( Hope they fix whatever bug prevents it from working correctly."
"March 3, 2016","I really find listening to specific musics enjoyable. the commercials aren't that bad except they replay the same 5 over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over AND OVER AGAIN>... every 15 minutes I think... that alone has steered me away. I now listen to iHeart Radio... they play the same commercials but, only ON EVERY HOUR.... still annoying but, not as often......"
"September 10, 2016","Yes"
"February 4, 2015","I love Pandora on my big screen at home. Now I have it on my Kindle too. With one touch of the button!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT !!!!"

"May 31, 2016","Have always loved pandora!"
"March 23, 2016","It did not work. Had to remove from apps."
"February 11, 2014","Enjoy this while I am using my Kindle ..... like to listen to the stations that I have made ...... this is a nice app and would be a nice addition to anyone's Kindle ... the music lovers especially"
"April 2, 2013","Pandora is great - plus it's free if you don't mind listening to some commercials. The only problem I've had with this app is that it won't let me click ""still listening"" when the music stops, but I just close and reopen the app and it's fine."
"August 9, 2016","Love It!!!"
"December 30, 2014","This is a awesome app !! You can listen to what ever music you want to.Rap, hip-hop, county, rock and more so I hope you like this app."
"February 20, 2015","Will not upload. No help provided"
"July 22, 2016","Love the music"

"September 28, 2015","Great. My husband has Alzheimer's and he loves listening to his favorite music."
"July 26, 2016","Love Pandora."
"June 12, 2016","Its ok but a lot of ads"
"April 10, 2014","Very nice indeed. Love it. Adore it. Entertaining. Calming. What a program. Strongly recommend it for relaxation or for parties, for when one is doing crafts or for whatever occasion..."
"November 1, 2013","We were the 50's teens, & the site gives us the music that makes us feel young again. we also like Neil Diamond, Bueble' & Barbara S., among other new, but very good singers & musicians. And we get it on Pandora !"
"August 22, 2015","It would be better if I was able to have more options when use it on my amazon TV stick."
"July 26, 2016","Love this app"
"April 5, 2014","I hate Pandora because one day I tried to make an account and it wouldn't let me it said Pandora can not accept your registration right now all three times I tried so I give it no stars."
"July 17, 2016","I Love pandora."
"October 6, 2013","If you are fine with a little randomness, this is perfect for you. I have found new songs and new artists I like now due to this app. However, there are a few problems: 40 hour limit: for mobile devices, you get 40 hours of music per week. That's a little over 5 hours per day, which is good if you don't listen to as much as I do (I'm almost constantly listening to music) Ads: not too bad, the limit is what gets me. What annoys me a little, however is that I think the ads are included in your limit.  Sure, they give a couple good solutions. The first option is to pay a dollar for unlimited music, but that's just for a month. Second is Pandora One, which is the dollars a month if I remember right. If you have access to a computer, that's the best option in my opinion. However, getting it on mobile is also nice for when a computer isn't on and ready."
"August 8, 2016","Wonderful."
"March 3, 2014","This is such a great app. Especially since it is built into my new car radio system. Just plug the cell phone into the USB port and connect yo Pandora. Love this app and if course the music."
"July 8, 2016","i do love pandora"
"May 25, 2013","If you like listening to your favorite tracks while you read, this is a good substitute for the original Kindle music player on the old ""liquid ink"" units. It's a useful app and runs well. Nothing fancy, it simply does the job. Enjoy!"
"January 1, 2014","We can listen any music of any genera of any language without changing the cd. We are enjoying Portuguese, fado music, french Latin Hindi, American. Not able together israle or mid eastern music"
"May 13, 2015","When you play first the only thing wrong with it is that you have to wait and wait for the person to play!!!!"
"November 3, 2015","Pandora is amazing. I love it. Great mix of music according to my taste and style."
"February 26, 2014","A limited app not of any help to be in the way of a useful thing I might get my basketball real time same day broadcasts"
"July 28, 2014","I like Pandora very much. There are so many choices in music. My favorite is classical. Just type in an artist for the songs. Great for listening while you read."
"July 7, 2016","Pay your artists."
"July 25, 2016","Great product"
"March 29, 2015","If you like music and relaxing this is 4 u, it just throws your day down the toilet squirts new ones back up😊😀😀😀🗽"
"December 3, 2015","Gotta love somebody who lets you program your own radio station ."
"May 26, 2013","I love pandora, and personally, the ads don't bother me (I mean, I'm not going to pay to get rid of them, so it works for me). I really love that I can have my kindle charging and have pandora play while my kindle is turned off (not powered off, just the screen) and it'll still charge and play the music!  The only problem I have with this app (and why it's not five stars) is that sometimes when I closed the app, it'll start up the app again (causing it to switch out what I'm doing to pandora). I found that I couldn't just leave the app, I had to actually hit the menu button (on the upper right corner) to quit so that it would stay closed.  Other than that, I found no faults and would definitely recommend this free app to anyone!"
"October 23, 2015","PANDORA is AWESOME! I listen daily. Very few advertisements. A Must Have!"
"March 12, 2014","I now can listen to the music I enjoy any time and any place. I love it! I can turn on Pandora and know that I am going to hear my type of music because I get to choose what I want to hear"
"June 1, 2016","I love all the play lists"

"July 4, 2015","I enjoy listening to pandora! I only wish more of the selected music would play vs similar artist."
"May 14, 2016","love this app music on the go"
"February 8, 2016","What can I say, it's Pandora! On my Kindle HD 10."
"April 3, 2013","I just signed up for the monthly service fee and glad I did as they have been very attentive with questions i had and the service and product works great for me in my shop and on the move. Highly recommend to anyone who is into music... Rob Eddy"
"August 19, 2016","Love it"
"January 5, 2015","I love music! All kinds! But my favorite is jazz fusion and I can't believe how much they have. If you love music this is the best.!"
"January 29, 2016","Pandora won't take my password what app does that???"
"March 16, 2013","Wonder resource for finding music similar to your tastes! My only reservation is - at this relatively early date of my use- I have occasional problems finding certain sites in the app."
"August 23, 2016","Super!"
"July 5, 2014","I love Pandora! I play it on my kindle at the office . So many different types of music to choose from. I play whatever fits my mood for the day. Thanks for a great app."
"April 14, 2013","I love pandora on my laptop because there's no limit but in my kindle they have a limted time for a month. If you want an unlimited time listening you have to pay 3.99 per month. Other than that it works great even though there is ads it's alright."
"July 18, 2016","Love the music"
"February 20, 2016","Love my Pandora app! Couldn't live without it!"
"February 11, 2016","Im glad I can finally listen to MCR in a station!"
"January 14, 2014","Great way to listen to music without having to search for the music you want to hear. Select your genre or favorite artist and Pandora does the rest including new artists or others with similar music."
"July 30, 2014","I subscribe to several internet music programs and this is one of the best. The free version is O.K. but if you listen to music alot, I recommend the paid version."
"August 4, 2016","Great app."
"February 28, 2016","So many choices in music. I use it everyday!"
"February 10, 2014","Pandora provides a wide variety of music selections at no cost! How could this not be a perfect combination??? I love the ability to funnel my listening into one artist's or genre's collections."
"October 7, 2015","I love being able to listen to music from my computer. Pandora is wonderful!"
"October 18, 2012","This is a good product. I signed up for the free Pandora radio and I have not been disappointed. You pick the style of artist and music you enjoy listening to and a good variety is provided. I could go without the commercials, but you've got to take the good with the bad."
"July 30, 2015","Must be on-line to use. Fine at home but would like to save and play when traveling by car."
"May 3, 2016","Great alternative to the radio."
"March 21, 2016","It's Pandora, who doesn't love Pandora?!"
"March 14, 2013","Sometimes it seems a little limited on what they play and I would like to be able to ""thumbs down"" more of the ones I don;t really want to listen to, but otherwise, pretty good station, m"
"April 22, 2013","I love this app. It is easy to use and lets you choose what ""channel"" you like listening to. It wlll give you a variety of different ""Like"" songs to the type you requsted. I don't like that you can only skip 6 songs in an hour and it MAKES you listen to those you don't like. I think you should have th option to skip if its not your fave...waste of good listening time and money ifyou have purchased Pandora for the ""no commercials"" aspect, which I have. Also, I listen to it at work and if you don't ""Like"" or ""Dislike"" evey once in awhile it will pause your station and make you answer ""ARE YOU THERE, WE PAY FOR OUR MUSIC SO WE DON'T LIKE PLAYING TO AN EMPTY ROOM"" what the ????I mean really? They pay? No we pay and to pause our music just to get us to stop our WORK to answer inorder to listen kind of buggs me. But again the music is good and I do like the app."
"June 25, 2016","Love Pandora Radio!"
"July 17, 2016","love the music"
"April 30, 2013","Pandora has been around for a while and most people know how well it works. I use it every morning to listen to music while riding my motorcycle to work. Picking a favorite channel is a breeze and I usually don't have to skip songs I don't like."
"June 18, 2013","I listen to Pandora more than I watch T.V. & love love the comedy stations. My only concern is that I'm going to eventually hear every stand-up routine available. And of course the endless music choices are the best :-) happy user indeed"
"April 19, 2016","Perfect solution to paid services."
"December 31, 2015","I have never been disappointed with their choice of music."
"February 5, 2016","Great selections, sounds, and great format. Enjoy."
"July 21, 2016","Love it!!!!!!"
"May 11, 2014","I like the way it suggests similar style of music. Just wonderful! I am new to the radio so I can't say much but will certainly update my review as I become familiar with the app."

"October 22, 2015","Joining Pandora was one of the best investments I've nade in a long time!"
"August 13, 2013","It cut in and out constantly. I don't think I was able to hear more than two songs from start to finish, not to mention the down time in between partial songs. The selections would have been great if we could have heard them."
"October 8, 2015","I love this app it has loads of songs and FOR FREE it's amazing!!!!!!! 11/10"

"August 12, 2016","Love it"
"February 7, 2014","This was a reasonable purchase. The product did not performed as described even if the price was adequate. I don't recommend the purchase. Pandora forces you to listen to music you don't to hear."

"March 29, 2016","Pandora is awesome for music variety!"
"February 4, 2014","It said I'm sorry but it's to late to register your account so if I were you don't be stupid to buy this. Just a precaution"

"August 11, 2016","love it"
"April 27, 2016","where has this been all my life"
"November 28, 2015","Works well. I will have to man up and pay to get rid of the ads."
"February 3, 2013","I Love Pandora! I like that I can choose a genre or just an artist and it picks other artists to add to the station. Maybe the best feature is the voting, because it allows you to customize your station. Lots more I haven't even dug into yet. Favorite app!"

"January 29, 2016","Pandore is really cool. It one of the best music ."
"December 5, 2013","My only complaint is the repetition of artists and songs on several of my stations and not enough focus on the selected artist. I have Pandora on all of my electronic devices so I can listen wherever I am."
"February 27, 2013","Again I love this on my desk top at work and at home, but on my Kindle it only plays a very short while and then turns itself off. I'm sure I'm missing something but don't have the time or patience to figure it out! so no won't be using it......sorry..."

I can easily listen to my music all day & if I don't like something thats playing, I can go in and change it. I like it because I can put in my preferences of music and the artist that I really love to listen to. Its so easy and I'm so thankful that it is free. Thank you Pandora"
"May 28, 2016","Don't know how to get.."
"July 16, 2016","Disappointed"
"February 4, 2016","I love having my stations on while I am working."
"November 16, 2016","This is a great app for me. I just downloaded it to my new Kindle Fire this week. I love Christmas music and it is the best way for me to hear a variety of Christmas songs--even year round. I love the selection and how my choices are considered as Pandora customizes it for me. I'm so glad I have this now!"
"June 28, 2016","Awesome channels"
"August 11, 2016","awsome"
"May 19, 2016","Love the variety of music"
"May 25, 2014","I'm rilly mad be cause my family member keeps getting station I don't like .how do get rid of them! also it's not a vary good app when you like a song it adds a station ! :("
"March 19, 2015","This app has been good with all phones, but sounds even better with my new phone. Never cared for all the ads though."
"August 6, 2015","Good app but after getting it from Amazon I was flooded with emails and ads on my phone."
"July 17, 2015","What can I say, who doesn't love Pandora? You can make your favorite channel by picking your favorite song, your favorite artist, your favorite genre or just add the already made channels by Pandora. You can also give each song you hear a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down"" which helps to train the station to play what you like. If a particular song comes on and you don't feel like listening to it, you can move ahead to the next song. It really gives a good mix of music and I really enjoy listening to it. I have found this app to be quite reliable. I never seem to have a problem with it crashing. I have it downloaded to my phone and tablet. In the car, I hook up the phone to the car's speakers before I leave the parking lot and using my 4G, I listen to Pandora as I drive around. It is so much better than listening to local radio that plays whatever it wants instead of what I want. I am very happy with this app!"
"April 27, 2016","Sometimes too many advertising"
"July 15, 2013","How can you go wrong it's free and you can program it to play only what you like and after a while it understands what your preferences are. Instead of buying the music you can simply create your own station that you want to hear."
"April 27, 2016","Very helpful to me personally."
"July 24, 2016","Convenient"
"April 17, 2014","always a joy to have this one. its definitely a fun app to have on your phone and keeps your entertained."
"February 6, 2014","My grand daughter( age 5) loves to listen to music while she takes a bath. Pandora has her favorite songs and makes bath time go better. ..Plus I like to listen to the Oldies but goodies myself."
"May 14, 2016","boring, no longer relevant"

"February 8, 2016","The music is awesome. But the commercials suck."
"June 23, 2016","Great.... Awesome"
"November 30, 2014","only down fall is if you accidentally click on it, it will still run the program and play music, even if you quickly hit the home button."
"April 16, 2014","Very easy to use fast downloading good set up simple operation. Haven't noticed any bug yet so far at all"
"October 4, 2013","I don't know who could not love Pandora. It almost seems silly to rate it. I just hope that Pandora doesn't someday charge for even the basic version but then again, I know I would purchase it anyway! A must have!"
"June 5, 2016","Won't let me sign up."
"June 27, 2016","just another app"

"January 24, 2016","Love it. Listen at home and all day in the office."

"July 12, 2015","I like it but I would like it more if there were filipino music on it to then I would love it"
"March 2, 2015","Decided not to download, due to phishing & privacy concerns, by outside marketers & others, in order to listen to music."
"February 20, 2016","Just started seems to play the songs I like."
"September 3, 2014","my one year old neice order this on my phone ...dont know how..i dont even know how to do it. she was just dancin to the music one day. guess she loved it!!"
"January 24, 2016","I have Pandora on my phone and tablet and love it."
"January 4, 2013","This makes the Kindle Fire a great book... what better than to match the music to the type of book you are reading at the time? Almost like having the ability to choose my own music to match the ""movie"" the book is producing in my imagination. Perfect!"
"September 9, 2013","I love the variety of music that I can get from Pandora. I also appreciate the amount of time that I'm given between having to reawaken it. I can find all that I am interested in listening to with few interruptions here."
"August 22, 2016","fun"
"June 7, 2014","Awesome. I like the selection of oldie stations (50's - 70s). Also, the commercials are few. I have already passed on my enjoyment with Pandora with friends and family."
"September 23, 2015","I like being able to get all of the latest songs and the sound is very clear."
"February 3, 2014","I have been using Pandora for 3 years and am very pleased with it's function and selections. It works best if you subscribe to Pandora One as you eliminate the commercials. Good job guys."
"May 12, 2016","Listen to this every night"
"May 12, 2016","it stopped working........"
"April 30, 2014","I have used pandora on other devices before and like the quality and variety of the music. It's nice to pick a type of music and have song after song that you like to listen to."
"July 5, 2013","I use this every time I have internet. I purchase the commercial free for $35 each year. I would us it all the time but the 4 G on my phone goes into wait mode. Any way this is one of the greatest music things to come out. Love it."
"February 9, 2016","Wont play on my kindle"
"June 25, 2016","Its great thanks"

"June 19, 2015","I love Pandora especially when I'd rather just listen to the comedy channels instead of the music"
"August 25, 2013","I have just started using Pandora so I don't have a lot of information to base an opinion. It is very nice to be able to listen to music I have picked while working on the computer and having soft music in the background."
"December 29, 2013","I don't know why anyone would NOT get this app. It's free, and provides you with all types of music. You can go on with your work and let Pandora play your favorite songs in the background. Great app!"
"August 15, 2015","Discovered Pandora a few months ago and I love it! The Christian Hits is my favorite."

"January 14, 2014","I downloaded Pandora because my daughter listens to it alot on her phone. We both love Southern Gospel music. Honestly, I haven't tried this app out much yet, so can't give a decent review on it."
"January 12, 2013","Installed it on my Kindle Fire HD and it's a great companion if you want some soft music while reading. Much better and easier than carrying a radio around. Can also be installed on your iPhone. Which is better that using up all your iPhone storage space."
"April 26, 2015","I love this music station u do not like it it is u opinion I think is awsome yeaaaaa so yea hi i am a shadkw"

"January 24, 2013","Pandora works well on my kindle 8.9 hd. The speakers are great. I have been a pandora fan for about 4 years now and while i noticed a rise in advertisements it still beats the radio by a long shot. Occasional glitches on opening the app but nothing serious"
"January 2, 2014","Choose the music type you want to listen to and when you want it. Pandora is great in that you can read some additional information about the artists and about the albulms that you have interest in."
"February 19, 2013","I simply love this product on my tablet. I have it on my home computer and being able to have it on my tablet to take with me whether to another room or to the park it is wonderful. The fact that I can choose music to fit my mood is great. I love it!!!"
"April 21, 2014","I don't know what I'm doing wrong on this, but if I put, say Elvis, in and expected to hear all Elvis, I only got one song and then it switches to another Artist. I just gave up."
"August 15, 2014","Without a doubt, the pest personal radio programmer available. You decide what plays and what does not. Give it a thumbs down and it will never play again."

"October 21, 2015","The ability to tailor your own station content is a very good feature."
"February 18, 2013","This is my favorite radio app ever! I have had a Pandora subscription since about 2007 and it has always impressed me with its variety and ease of use. It's totally worth $36 a year to be able to listen commercial free for an unlimited amount of hours!"
"July 31, 2016","great.."
"May 30, 2016","Pandora works for me!"
"January 6, 2014","Recommended.... I spend many hours listening to the music that I choose depending on the mood I'm in. Great for background when reading or searching for new material and songs. For me a must have."

"June 16, 2016","they deserve it 5"
"July 28, 2013","I love Pandora! It is very easy to use, and has already provided lots of entertainment. I like it much better than the radio- fewer commercials, and you can like or dislike songs so the channel is better suited to your liking."
"November 7, 2014","Not crazy about the commercials but I understand someone has to make some money. (yes I am aware I can pay a fee to get it commercial free)."
"June 25, 2016","One word great."
"February 27, 2016","Great! Like the idea of picking my music."
"March 25, 2016","Pandora. What's not to like? Music."
"August 7, 2016","Great"
"March 29, 2016","Be sure to read the full agreement"
"March 25, 2014","I've been hearing about Pandora, but thought it was one of those satillite radio things that were super expensive and kind of a waste of time, especially in an age of downloading music. Well I recently have become addicted to various styles of Gregorian Chant music to help me relax & meditate and found Pandora to have the best selctions. Plus, it being a free app to download I thought ""why not?"". Love this app; definately recommend for anyone looking for that hard to find sound in a sea of contemporary music."
"July 7, 2016","ITS COOL !!!"
"March 2, 2016","Tremendous praise music. What a blessing"
"July 16, 2016","Very good"

I have learned a great deal about the Canadian countryside, the people, their delicious foods, their habits and their individual characters. I love the Chief Inspector's homicide team and their loyalty to Inspector Gamache. Each book has featured a victim murdered in a totally different way under mysterious circumstances. It is fun to see how the inspector finds his ""man"". I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series. I think it is best to read the books in order.."

"July 9, 2015","Pandora streams almost flawless. Its easy to find a station for you, by artist or song."
"January 25, 2014","The ads are ridiculous. There are apps that do the same thing for free and you don't have to wait for the ads to run."
"August 1, 2014","I went back to using spotify because I couldn't ask for a song by title."

"February 6, 2014","Pandora is the best way for me to listen to music and do other things without having to reopen the app and look for another song. They could lighten up on the ads though #frustrated"

"June 6, 2016","LOVE THIS APP"

"May 3, 2016","can't access pandora"
"November 7, 2015","Let's you listen to music on my fire like any other device."
"July 5, 2014","I have listened to Pandora music for over a year now, and I have enjoyed the freedom and variety of music offered through this app. It syncs well with my laptop and I know that it keeps a record of all my favorite ""thumbs up"" songs. I have appreciated the fact that the advertising on the app is not all intrusive, but is displayed in a small box in the center while the music plays on. My only negative, is that my music choice while enjoyable will tend to repeat itself more frequently after listening for a few days. The variety is limited and repetitive because it is free, but otherwise it is a pleasure to listen to Pandora. I believe it is worthwhile to invest in the paid version which offers more choices to those who can afford it."
"February 20, 2016","It's an App, it is for Pandora. That's what it does."
"June 19, 2014","No other free music system let's you choose only the music that you like. It's something I have on all my electronics from TV to smart phone and I use them all"

"March 1, 2013","Pandora plays all the right songs you want, always the genre you want. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that there are adds almost every three songs! But, overall if you are a person who likes music I definitely recommend Pandora!"
"May 2, 2014","Great app. I have been using Pandora since before there were apps and highly recommend it. Great features in place and modifications to make it better keep popping up."
"March 29, 2016","The wife and I love Pandora"
"January 13, 2013","Not real pleased in January as it is still playing Christmas music. I am able to receive this on my computer, my Droid and my Kindle which is prodigious. Remember you can only skip forward 6 songs per hour. It allows you to like or dislike a song"
"March 29, 2016","Tunes tunes and more tunes."
"April 23, 2016","Use it all the time!!!"
"June 13, 2014","Great personalized radio. Love the options and variety without interruption. So easy to find a theme, change when your mood changes and return when you're ready."
"May 22, 2013","What is not to like if you can listen to your favorite type of music. Wish they could give you more free time on your kindles. 40 hours just not enough and can't justify the extra cost for more, when listening to radio is free."
"April 17, 2014","Try as I might, this app does not work on my Toshiba Thrive 10 tablet ... However, I use it on my Roku boxes and LOVE it!"

"February 3, 2014","I have several ""stations"" and pick the one I am in the mood for or start a new one. I like the choices they make, and if I don't---poof, it is gone. So, I never get tired of it."
"March 2, 2016","It's there for me whenever I ask."
"October 30, 2013","Control your own music by setting up stations based on the types of singers you like. Separate genre's by station's of your own and even access music from other countries without having to travel there."
"December 3, 2015","Love it got all the gospel songs I love. Thank you 😊"

"March 2, 2016","Excellent been using for 5 years"
"March 18, 2015","the app won't start for my kindle. I like pandora but with the app crashing on my device, I'm disappointed."
"June 24, 2015","Love it - great selection of music - it just needs to have an unlimited amount of skips"
"June 15, 2016","Nice!!!!."
"June 15, 2016","Love it!!"
"December 2, 2012","its ok. im not really satisfied with this app, though it was free. its very annoying, ll sometimes have to go back to the app while reading a book or playing a game to press the play button again. but, it was free, so its ok for not having to pay for it."
"August 7, 2013","I just downloaded this app and love it! There's nothing like reading a great book while listening to whatever music style you like. I can't wait to explore it more and pick other types of music for easy listening!"
"December 2, 2015","By far my favorite for listening to my kind of music"
"October 13, 2015","I have really enjoyed Pandora in my new car..better than Sirius"
"October 14, 2013","Loaded Pandora on Tablet and PC. Works OK on PC but not on tablet. Exchanged 5 emails with tech support but still had a problem. Gave up!"
"October 22, 2015","Love listening to old songs that you can;t here on the radio."
"May 5, 2016","Item as described."
"June 19, 2013","Okay so when I open other apps while using Pandora when I go to skip it makes the screen go black then my Kindle tells me that it need to force close so press okay and then it just reopens the app with out me telling it to."
"February 3, 2016","Connects well! No buffering as of yet!"
"May 27, 2016","User Friendly"
"February 21, 2016","works for what we need to work as."
"April 30, 2015","As most of you know, Pandora is a must at work! This is one of my favorite apps. Highly recommend."
"May 1, 2013","I'm hooked! Really enjoy creating own station selections and like option of adding variety to established station. I have free version so get the pop up adds and commercials. The commercials are very brief though so it is worth it."
"May 27, 2016","The best ever"
"May 29, 2015","Use Pandora on the road mostly . Luv it sometimes it's on point. Makes the trip enjoyable."
"April 20, 2015","I have just down'd Pandora and so far it is a fantastic App. It finds other music LIKE the song I pick and allows me to build what is called a Radio Station. Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows what you like it will play songs from that artist, or era, (80's rock). I think it does even more but as I mention I just acquired the app. Also it's free with small pop-up ads, or you can pay and then no ads at all. I really like it!"
"April 26, 2016","great music all day!"
"June 22, 2016","Love it"
"March 9, 2016","Pretty good for being free...."

"January 27, 2016","I get to custom tune my own radio station."
"November 18, 2014","I listen to pandora 24-7 just about. I only watch tv approx. 3 hrs a week the rest is relaxing music, piano man etc while I read."
"January 2, 2013","This music service allows me to listen to several songs from an artist that I might have heard on the radio or TV, and really find out if I want to hear more. It is easy to use, and setting up a new station takes a few seconds. Couldn't be easier."
"January 2, 2013","I love Pandora. I only use the free app., and still its awesome! The commercials are rare, and I don't mind them anyway. Commercials allow the program to exist - just like television. This is a GREAT way to get all the music you could ever use!!"
"April 12, 2016","Hi I love Pandora music"
"May 8, 2016","Very easy to use."
"July 18, 2013","This program used to be the way to listen to your music and ""chill-lax"" but now it has, at least this is how I feel, I am elderly, but it has gotten to hard to use. Wish it were still simple, hated to leave it."
"November 3, 2015","Easy to use and very nice to have access to music anywhere"
"March 17, 2016","I love it so glad I found it"
"August 22, 2013","This app works on my android but not on my kindle anymore. Just says ""Pandora one"" nothing else. I would change my review if this is fixed"
"September 21, 2014","great for my new smart phone. Still figuring out all the bells and whistles but so far I'm happy and so are the other members of my family."
"June 30, 2016","great"
"February 19, 2016","Simply outstanding love Pandora !!"
"February 26, 2014","I am an eclectic lover of good music. I got stuck in a genre that I didn't like and was annoyed with the process to move on. I found the experience too frustrating to deal with."
"March 19, 2015","i love this app because you get to download your own music and albums i jest love so much thank you."
"March 8, 2016","Can't live without my Pandora!"
"March 25, 2014","I love the variety of music Pandora Media offers. The rating would be 5 stars if the connectivity was not randomly interrupted. I have recommended Pandora Media to friends."
"June 7, 2016","Great app."
"March 12, 2016","What happened? Use to be good"
"March 30, 2016","lose the station at times"
"January 29, 2014","This works just the same as the desktop version but if I had to give it a negative mark, it would be that it seems to go to commercial a lot sooner than it does on the desktop version."
"March 25, 2015","Pandora awesome all ways good music to listen to."
"March 30, 2016","The variety is awesome!!!"
"March 25, 2017","All good"

"June 11, 2016","Excellent"
"October 18, 2013","I love being able to pick a type of song and have so many great similar songs follow. There is no need to search for what you want to hear. Pandora does it for you. It's the best app I have downloaded."
"September 25, 2014","It doesn't do what it's sapposed to do. I think once I get help from a techy friend, it will be better - but I shouldn't need to get help."
"February 8, 2014","It tends to freeze quite a bit and shuts down right before it starts up...basically, a lot of glitches.  I can say that it works better than Slacker....a whole lot better!"
"March 29, 2016","Wonderful, and Excellent!"
"March 29, 2016","Great music. I really it."
"December 10, 2014","best music app ever. it's like music at my fingertips my sister and I love this app she's the one who told me about this app"

"January 17, 2016","Plays what I like when I want to hear it."
"June 28, 2016","Great"
"January 5, 2014","Since adobe has decided to not allow linux based operating systems to stream audio guess this is the only option we have to listen to music but I've never been that impressed with pandora."
"April 17, 2013","Great Music all the time. I sleep, eat and dream Pandor, however, not in this exact order I enjoy the variety of music. I can travel all over the world and not leave my bed."
"April 6, 2016","Use it all the time. Great app"
"February 24, 2014","I just put Pandora on my Kindle and have just played music by Lori Line, one of my favorite musicians. I'm looking forward to having time to explore more fine artists on Pandora."
"January 27, 2014","I don't think I will have to look any further for some music. I have been using this for years on the PC and it is working great on this Kindle Fire HD. Very cool. Groovy. Far Out Man!"
"June 28, 2016","works"
"March 15, 2016","Great music selections. Best"
"January 9, 2015","Use it on my satellite tv most and only complaint is it will sometimes freeze up and play the same songs over and over"
"May 15, 2015","It won't let me use it on the go I love it but when I can't use when I need it, it's got to go"
"November 23, 2015","Amazing! Definitely my go to app for music streaming."
"April 6, 2015","I just started only 3 days ago. So far, its very nice. I use it on my kindle and the sound is great."
"July 2, 2016","Five"
"January 15, 2013","I am just starting to get to know this app. It looks like a great window into the world of music and is great to have on plane flights, long drives, etc."
"June 19, 2016","Love it"
"July 22, 2015","She is a wonderful friend, but way too limited on functions. A great techno toy."
"February 12, 2014","Pandora is much better than i thought it would be when compared to I Heart Radio. the music that they play is spot on to my intrest . I give them an A+.  John Asbell"
"June 18, 2016","Nothing"
"January 8, 2015","I liked last.fm service better, but they pulled the plug a while back. Not as much to offer but it still works great."
"October 21, 2013","Nothing better than to have a program that learns what you enjoy!  I often put it on during house parties...no need to even touch it again!!  Unless of course someone has a request!"
"June 5, 2016","Works well"
"December 24, 2013","I couldn't even listen to music. At first it was not available, then my session was over. Don't buy this app. it is trash"
"November 22, 2015","I love to listen especially when I can't fall asleep."
"May 9, 2014","Pandora has always been my favorite radio streaming app. I use it on my phone as well. The new features are pretty cool. Like how you can post favorites to Facebook."
"January 31, 2014","Being a true lover of music and all types of music, I love Pandora. It makes listening easy and enjoyable. I listen nonstop. Music on the go or at home. Keep these great ideas coming."
"March 16, 2014","I think it is so much fun to see what happens when I choose my favorite songs. But I wish I could skip every song I d like. Instead I have to switch stations t change music."
"January 28, 2016","user friendly app and always improving"
"May 22, 2016","Love pandora."
"May 18, 2015","I would give in 5 stars but I don't like the skip limit 😖😖😖😖. but over all I give it a 🙋"

"March 8, 2016","Music I love and nothing else"
"November 7, 2012","I like Pandora. Change the station depending on my mood. Country , Old Country Classic, Singer and Songwriter, Sleep music. You name it. And they have a nice selection of Charley Pride. Some songs repeat more than I like, but over all very good. Susan"
"July 4, 2016","Yes"
"March 12, 2016","I enjoy listen to my Pandora"
"June 16, 2016","Love it"
"October 24, 2016","The concept is great. I do believe that Pandora knows that I am a Sirius user and play more commercials than my friends who do not subscribe to Sirius."
"May 7, 2015","Listened for three hours while relaxing and loved every song except one, and it was OK. Great!"
"January 27, 2016","I really enjoy the stations elections!"

"June 21, 2013","I have the free version so I get to listen to the advertisements : ( also I don't have the greatest coverage provider (I'm poor lol) so it cuts in and out while I mow, seriously though I do like it and use it all the time"
"June 7, 2016","Love it!!"
"January 22, 2016","It so stupid he music won't play at all"

"October 23, 2015","I find Pandora to be most exellant especially late at night"
"September 24, 2014","PANDORA is the most wonderful radio station because it plays exactly what I want to listen to, when I want to. Yeah!!!!!! I feel spoiled!"
"December 3, 2015","Perfect. It does exactly what it's supposed to do."
"March 2, 2016","just got it but so far so good"
"June 28, 2016","Good"
"August 1, 2015","It uses data so it gets 2 stars. If it didnt use data, it would get 5 stars."
"March 28, 2016","Works great for a radio."
"September 5, 2013","You can't even pick the music that you want to listen to and some random song will just com on this app is just a wast of time ok listen people do not get this app trust me ok please do not get it.(WARNING);)"
"March 28, 2014","Create and customize your own radio station, or choose one their existing channels. Create several channels, to choose from depending on your mood or the company you have."
"March 15, 2016","Music stations are amazing."
"December 29, 2013","I can play songs according to my mood. For example, I have songs to fold clothes by, read a book by, paint a picture by. I can learn more about the artists I like with the biograhpy info."
"August 10, 2013","Even with the ads this is a gem. I can select my artist and it will bring up songs by that artist and others from the same genre. I can click on a dislike and never get that artist again. Plays while using other apps."
"May 14, 2016","Love Pandora!!"
"February 17, 2014","I typed in Josh Grobin and I can listen to the selection of music for hours. I haven't quite decided if I want to subscribe yet ( and pay the fee) but I might do that soon."
"February 17, 2014","I like that I can play this in my car via bluetooth. There are so many stations, its pretty awesome. However, there should not be ads, but at least they don't last extremely long."
"April 3, 2013","I would recommend to anyone who loves music and already has a Pandora acct with the loaded channels of your music choice. I'm a huge metal head and I love when I can find apps and stuff that have a selection of preferred music taste."
"June 9, 2016","Love It!"
"April 21, 2016","I love using Pandora! I recently got a subscription and enjoy it even more now that I have it commercial free. I usually listen from my television and after listening for a while it just shuts down- not sure if that is an issue with Pandora or my Internet carrier. Still it's a great value and I listen almost every day."
"December 6, 2015","It doesn't even give me the song I am looking for"
"July 22, 2014","I love Pandora. I listen to it at work, home, and even while I am camping if they happen to have WiFi! It's your own music pics; what's not to love!"
"April 4, 2015","Hear some good music choices, you start the music genra, then they help you find music in your genra."
"September 27, 2014","Great music and simple control personalized stations are very helpful in hearing your favorite music. I will always use Pandora radio :-)"
"March 4, 2014","I used to have Pandora. it was great until I got the upgrade. Now it won't let me sign in with mine or my dads. just a waste of space!"
"December 31, 2012","I love music, MY music...Pandora gives me the option to personalize my own listening choices! So whether I need energetic beats to clean the house, holiday tunes to set the mood, or calming music in the hectic workplace...Pandora is my top choice!"
"November 13, 2012","Not bad for a radio app. Plays music I haven't heard in years. it's not Spotify but since I can't get it on my tablet Pandora will do. The one thing I dislike is I can only skip 6 time in any given hour so I just change thru my song list to switch songs."
"October 17, 2015","This app is great when I want not-awful music to listen to, when I want to have control over the sort of thing I want to listen to but have no idea what it is exactly what I want.  But it is terrible on the newest fire tv. It takes at least five minutes to load a song, something I thought was a fluke when I first installed it on the Fire tv but seems to be literally every time. Still works fine on my kindle and laptop and phone and that's why its still got three wtaes, but goodness it's awful on the Fire tv (which I give a resounding no-star review for). I hope that's fixed soon."
"January 29, 2014","PANDORA is one of the most exciting music stations I have ever had the pleasure of using! Crystal clear music from the genre I love. Highly recommend it to everyone that loves music!"
"January 23, 2016","Its Pandora- what else is there to say"
"March 8, 2016","Not able to connect oversea!"
"December 26, 2014","This lets me discover music and I can listen to music that fits me best . This app is amazing. I give it a thumbs up:-)"
"December 6, 2014","Good if you want basic streaming, but the ""Daily Skip Limit"" feature feels dated when compared to similar services."
"April 26, 2014","I love pandora it;s like my home stereo. I finally have music in my home. I have several different genres of music stations so I can choose the music to fit my mood."
"October 1, 2015","A great music application that works well on my Kindle Fire HD7"
"July 20, 2014","Pandora is a great app for listening to your favorite artists and records. I could listen for hours, but I have work to do around the house and yard."
"July 8, 2016","It's wonderful"
"December 30, 2013","Never opens. When ever I try to open it out just stays on the opening page. Waste of time. Any suggestions to fix it?"
"August 16, 2015","The best station ever,and that means along with the paireotic commercials"
"June 7, 2016","Love it!"
"November 2, 2015","Love it has everything I need Keep up the good work"
"January 5, 2014","There is nothing negative to be said about Pandora. App just sits right there waiting for you. It was a pre- installed app on my Smart TV and is now a downloaded on android and laptop."
"October 11, 2013","I love the way this app works. Not only can I bookmarks. my favorite bands. I get related groups with similar styles of music included. If I choose a southern rock band 3to 4 more similar ate included."

"August 10, 2016","i love it"
"December 3, 2015","i feel that amazon pandora music is really great"
"March 29, 2016","too hard to sign on"
"March 29, 2016","Great music and variety"
"November 26, 2013","It is wonderful that it syncs from my desktop. My only issue is the kindle doesn't have the best of speakers, but hey what the heck. I get MY music when I want it and can add new ones anytime"
"July 23, 2015","Onlybeenusingpandoraforashorttime,butitseemslikeagreatpleasureformyears.thanks"
"February 4, 2016","Worked well, even with commercials."

"April 27, 2016","I use it everyday"
"May 28, 2016","Great app!"
"December 26, 2012","I have enjoyed Pandora in the past, but now listening to Rhapsody more often. I like both. Between Pandora, Rhapsody and my iPod, and the radio I have more than enough for my music needs. I love the concept of creating a personal radio station."
"March 2, 2015","Choices like ""The Beatles Station"" should be ALL Beatles, not a mix of artists. Otherwise it's okay"
"February 6, 2014","I love Pandora. I love I can select any artist and it links up similar artist. When I am working from home I listen to Pandora a good part of the day when not on conference calls."
"January 3, 2015","I really like Pandora but, there is way to many adds, and I like that if u close out of the app the music still plays"
"February 12, 2016","Fix it and I'll change my review."
"September 7, 2015","Love pandora!"
"March 26, 2015","ok its the best just get it ya get it don't whait hit the download button its waiteing for u to hit it"
"March 10, 2016","Cant live without Pandora !"
"September 15, 2013","Pros:I love Pandora because it is pretty much like a radio and an MP3 Player combined in the sense that,you can choose your favorite songs,singers,rappers,or bands and the radio will give you their stations along with similar music related to what you chose.For example,if you type into the search engine,Brittney Spears,then her songs will show up with the new Britney Spears station you created and they will also add some songs from a similar artist like Cristina Aguilera,etc.I like this because you can learn new songs from many different artists.Pandora is really great at blending similar song styles.You can share the song or station you are listening to on facebook or twitter also.You are also allowed to skip a song you don't like by either pressing the skip icon or the dislike icon.The songs also comes with biography info about the artist/artists and the lyrics to each song as well as the album name.FREE.  Cons:Since Pandora is free and they pay for licenses to the songs,you are only allowed five or six skips a day.Afterwards,you can either stick it out or just change the station to something else.Pandora seems to only have certain songs from different artists not ALL their songs so even if you were to type in ""Count on Me"" by Bruno Mars for example into the search engine,it may just give you a different Bruno Mars song or a song like the one you requested but by a different artist altogether.Also,you cannot REWIND,FAST FORWARD,or REPLAY a song at all and I think that goes back to the fact that they have to pay for it.And,if you type in a song you just recently listened to and try to hear it again,for some reason it doesn't let you.  Summary: Pandora is a free radio station app where you can find your favorite songs and artists simply by typing their names into a search engine.You can always edit,meaning you can delete or add stations and it is a great way to learn new songs.While the skips are limited to five or six a day,each song provides you with lyrics and background information on the artist.You can always share what you are listening to on Facebook,Twitter,etc to let friends and family know but just remember you cannot replay a song so wait a bit to try to find it in the search engine.If you hit the like icon on a song,that particular song is more likely to show back up quicker so you wont have to wait long for it but just remember that you cannot rewind or fast forward,you can only PAUSE.Pandora is completely Iphone compatible and even pauses itself when you get an incoming phone call so you can always go back and resume a song when you are done talking.On the Kindle Fire,Pandora shows up nice and big on the screen which will help you to read the lyrics better! In all,Pandora is a amazing app to get for any device that is capable of having it and is the best music app created!!"
"November 23, 2014","enjoy the music. easy to start stations. the price is free. ads are very few and not distracting. well worth getting the app."
"February 3, 2016","Use it on wireless devices. Enjoy!"
"February 7, 2016","Still getting use to the settings."
"December 28, 2013","LOVE LOVE LOVE PANDORA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLAY IT EVERYDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MAKES MY WORKOUTS GO BY FASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LIKE MAKING MY OWN STATIONS IT SUPER FUN!!!!"
"March 16, 2013","The icon for the carousel and favorites is extremely pixelated it is annoying please fix it but other than that it is a great app and I have been a pandora one user for a few years"
"July 17, 2013","PANDORA CATERS TO ALL PEOPLE AND ALL GENRES OF MUSIC. I PARTICULARLY LOVE IT BECAUSE OF MY AGE. I CAN HEAR ALL THE OLDIES THAT I LOVE AND ALSO ENJOY SOME OTHER MUSIC THAT YOU OFFER.   THANKS FOR THE MUSIC"
"January 8, 2014","It's fun to be able to download music and then play it through my Kindle. However, if you are on an airplane, make sure you have earphones so you don't bother your neighbor passengers."
"July 6, 2014","i use this sometimes,but it only allows you three skips an hour and i dont like a lot of the artists they play,so i skip them,dont mind the commercials."
"January 29, 2016","not good instructions to get started"
"February 10, 2014","This is now my go-to place for listening to music, which is one of my favorite things to do. What a great way to go directly to the songs I love. Fast and easy to set up and use."
"May 19, 2014","I have loved Pandora in the past and the app is almost as good. The only thing I would change is that you can't like songs other than the one currently playing."
"May 13, 2016","Good variety."
"October 21, 2015","Nice choice of music overall with little or no commercials"
"April 27, 2014","Pandora's great. I love all the different genres and how it's laid out. I'm getting a lot of use from it because I like a lot of different types of music. Thanks."

"June 24, 2014","Best music ever! I love gospel, contemporary and praise music and Pandora is the best station ever. Just wish you didn't have to pay for ad free stations."

"December 28, 2013","I told it to play Yo Yo Ma and it started playing some kind of disgusting Jazz by itself.... off my device pronto!"
"March 14, 2013","Pandora works nicely on my new Kindle Fire. So why the 4 stars vs. a 5? Because, I am not sure it really deserves more than 4! In a week, I may find it very deficient in some unknown area, or in 6 months I may not be able to recall a time when I could get through the day without Pandora simulating my tastes in musics of all genres. The basic option cost me nothing, so maybe my lack of skin in the game tempers my enthusiasm or disdain. If it costs you nothing to try Pandora, I recommend that you get it and make your own assessment."
"March 24, 2015","Always nice"
"May 27, 2016","Love it"
"December 26, 2013","This is great. 1st time user and just putting in one artist Pandora played a lot of music from the artist and I was able to discover other artist that are similar and will investigate."

"May 14, 2016","Love it!!"

"May 5, 2016","Great music"

"April 21, 2016","Two thumbs up!"
"March 14, 2014","I love it. I was able to download my favorite singers (a lot of them oldie's) that you don't hear anymore. Since my cd player broke, this a treat I can listen to this..."
"March 18, 2016","i love it.great music"
"February 25, 2014","I enjoy listening to music and Pandora allows me to create stations according to my musical taste. I also listen to Pandora on my cell phone and Sonos. I recommend Pandora."
"July 18, 2013","I practice meditation and deeply love classic and SOME ""New Age"" music. I was given a Kindle Fire HD for a gift, and overall, I like it. The Kindle, that is. However, the person who said it is an instrument set up for Amazon's benefit and NOT the customers...had it right. Pandora is an excellent example of how Amazon bilks its customers: the App is advertised as ""free"", which causes the customer to download it, only to discover that to get any real pleasure out of it, there is a fee to be paid. Pandora is advertised as free: download it, tell it what you like, and you will get the music you want FOR FREE. Not so, of course: if you want the music for free, you must put up with horrible advertisements. If I liked rock-n-roll, it wouldn't be so bad, but right after an exquisite, soft, relaxing piece of music, I have to listen to a lengthy commercial for Allstate, or house paint or...whatever. Ads pop up all over the place. You can't see the album covers for ads. Oh, but wait: just pay the price, and the ads will go away! The price, by the way--at this point--isn't that bad. What I resent is that (1) the ""station"" created by Pandora for my liking doesn't play what I want, it plays what IT wants; and (2) I wasn't told ahead of time that if I wanted to actually be able to enjoy the App, I had to pay. I have found this to be true of nearly everything I have tried on my Kindle. The only thing it is truly good for is reading, and even then, the books are often poorly formatted, loaded with editing mistakes and misspelled words. The Apps are loaded with ads and invariably end up costing money the customer isn't warned about ahead of time. As for Pandora, it is very disappointing...I will continue to look for an applications that is put together with some sense of ethical idealism, one that doesn't break my eardrums with commercials and lurid pop-up ads."
"February 14, 2014","This is a great program. My husband is learning how to work it, and many things on it and how to work it. He says it is the best thing I ever gave him.(JUST KIDDING)......."

"March 13, 2014","Who doesn't like to hear their favorite music, uninterupted? This app wii give you that. Search by genre to find what you're in the mood for and listen commercial free."
"January 16, 2014","The Pandora app works as promises, but, as on it does on my phone, the app occasionally freezes when you pause your music and exit the app. It is easy to fix, but really annoying."

"May 21, 2016","Love it"
"March 13, 2013","Pandora is the greatest thing since sliced bread... To get all the great music for a fraction of the cost of purchasing all the CD's. Not to mention staying current with the newest songs."

"September 16, 2014","Constantly force closes on kindle fire hd. Ruins the listening experience. Please fix asap, otherwise this app is useless. .........."
"September 6, 2012","I tried Pandora in my car stereo system which has it built into the stereo, and the streaming was way too slow. It played the music just fine after it loaded but took too long to load the next song. It's a good idea but not what you want in your automobile."
"November 3, 2015","The app updates every night with no actual update."
"April 25, 2016","its pandora."
"April 29, 2016","Great Stuff"

"January 8, 2016","I listen to Pandora most days and love that I can switch from one type of music to another at the click of a button. I listen to the 52 silly sing along songs station with my toddler, then when she goes to bed I turn on some country or pop music. There are commercials, but not too overbearing, as we do not pay for the Pandora One."
"June 30, 2013","Love this app! I love the fact it's real user friendly and you can save any type of music. My e girls listen to the kids station all the time! I love that I can also find all types of music I enjoy on it as well."

"December 4, 2015","Has good music but always loses connection."
"March 3, 2015","Why do you need a account like what's the point right. Get rid of it and just let people use it."
"April 14, 2015","The latest and greatest version of Pandora is leaving something to be desired. The lockscreen widget only displays song info; to pause or skip, you have to unlock your device and go into the full app. The home screen widget now causes the app to crash if any buttons are used, and sometimes just trying to open the app. The developers have some work to do..."
"May 5, 2014","And I love commercial free radio. I also love my play-lists. What better combination than utilizing this locally owned medium for getting the music I crave."
"December 3, 2013","I love Pandora. You can't go wrong getting this app. It lets you make your own stations using singers names or songs."
"July 5, 2013","Its cool because you cand have what ever you want in the music you are looking for at that time , as much of it or as little of it, any age or type can listen to Pandora because everyone listens to music, right!"

"June 29, 2013","My daughter told me about Pandora music over a year ago and I never got around to set it up. Recently, when when's she realized I didn't have it, she set me up...I love it! Don't know why I didn't do it before."
"April 7, 2014","This app is a really good source to find your favorite songs. Pandora is an amazing app that lets you listen to music all day long, its free and there are few ads."

"June 9, 2014","downloaded app , worked fine for the first login. now i cant log in any more and am frustrated. works great on other computers just not my kindle fire."
"December 28, 2012","I enjoy the variety of music available through the Pandora app. However, I don't like the fact that it's a bit of a data hog when using on the phone and not connected through a connection that doesn't count against your monthly data limit."
"May 1, 2016","I love it."
"March 10, 2016","LOVE it on my Kindle!"
"April 22, 2016","FREE IS GOOD"

"February 18, 2013","I just need to research more how to use. I made a play list and it brings other artists in that I didn't pick but that's ok for now cause it reminded me of some I wanted. I would like to know how to just make my playlist play tho."
"December 5, 2013","I get to listen to all my old favorites with very little commercials. I love it! So glad my friend told me about it."
"December 19, 2013","The songs are the kind you can hear on the radio. It has a lot of Interrupting ads. It's repetitive...but it's FREE. So there is only so much complaining one can do. Good in a pinch."
"May 19, 2013","When I downloaded this app, I did not know that Pandora no longer streamed free music. However, I have set up a few stations with my favorite artists and still enjoy listening in spite of the commercial interruptions."

"May 26, 2016","good"
"February 1, 2014","You hear only the music you like, thumbs down and you never hear that song again. It's great, but I bet it won't be free for long. No commercials either, that is a huge plus!"

"February 27, 2016","Great music selections!"
"June 21, 2014","Fantastic! This app works great on my phone, Sanyo tv, and Roku, but it is a little glitchy in my tablet. All in all, I love it and recommend it!"
"June 16, 2013","I now know the lyrics to some of my favorite songs. (I was singing them with my own version of their lyrics!) When I enter an adjacent room I place my Kindle in a wooden salad bowl so that the sound is amplified."

"December 28, 2012","I love Pandora. It is a must have app. I love to set up my own stations and all family members have their own. I like being able to give a song the thumb up or down.  Only bad thing is to watch out for songs with explicit lyrics."
"April 1, 2014","Pandora is the most outstanding for musical entertainment on the go. One can listen to any genre of music Only problem could be intermittent commercials."
"March 20, 2016","Has the best music"

"August 28, 2015","Love that I can listen to music at any time. Even work love it!"
"July 23, 2013","Way better than I heart, free, and 5 star! What more can you possibly ask for? Pandora is obviously better I <3 doesn't let you add genres to the same station, and let you have more than one. It only does one of those."
"February 26, 2014","Why is it that each time I want to register for Pandora it tells my thank you for your interest in Pandora but unfortunately we are unable to register you at the moment?"
"December 2, 2015","ery enjoyable to pick my own type of music"
"April 27, 2016","Works fine"

"March 14, 2016","Pandora is the best"
"March 14, 2016","LOVE IT its amazing"
"April 1, 2012","This app is just as I titled it a very well structured app. I also like how you can create your own stations and then be able to erase it if needed. The best part of this app though is that it plays all the music you like and so far as I noticed it doesn't freeze or go blank."
"March 16, 2014","Why do I need a password this is like a music app just want to hear every thing is wasome ):"

"May 17, 2016","Great"
"January 2, 2014","I enjoy Pandora because it offered the experience I wanted in a simple manner. I wanted to listen to the things I like in a radio fashion without having to select each song individually. Pandora offers that, just type in the desired artists and songs and listen to just them or click shuffle and get a bit of the whole group plus some recommended related groups. The component of liking or disliking the song that is playing is another fantastic feature that ensure only the enjoyable stuff gets repeated."
"May 17, 2015","Great app for playing music but the advertisements can be annoying. Less ads please!"
"May 17, 2013","I would give it a 4.9 rating if I could because of the advertising which seems to pop up at inconvenient spots, but I'm too cheap to spring for the paid subscription since I don't listen to the app all that regularly."
"June 17, 2014","Pandora is simple and easy to use with all the current and old school music something for everyone! I can even set channels for the baby's to enjoy!"
"March 7, 2014","The technology is terrific. I have not had the occasion to do much but try it out but I am sure it will be great to be able to listen to the different kinds of music."

"March 23, 2014","I love this! even waking up in the morning is awesome because u wake up to music! I love being able to pick the music I want to listen to with just a few adds"

"June 10, 2014","Yikes! I've heard how awesome this is, I was able to download it using the amazon appstore but turns out it was not available in my country... boohoo"
"December 30, 2013","Can never get the music I want to play and I have a wide range of music that I like. Nothing new ever plays. I always get the old stuff. Not worth the free download. Worth just paying for spotify."
"January 3, 2016","This app is the best music app yet"
"May 15, 2016","Great"
"September 25, 2015","Very happy with this. Works great, easy to use, and fun!"
"June 25, 2014","I think Pandora is a great service. There isn't anything I dislike about it and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys good music."
"July 7, 2013","The app itself works farily well and has most features you would want. Pandora is never free! You either pay $36/yr for Pandora One with no commercials on the screen or audio, or you pay with your loss of time, self dignity and sanity by allowing Pandora to force feed you audio and video ads between songs. Far from free. Yes, I know millions of Americans have been conditioned to tolerate intrusive advertising in their daily life but there is a cost to you. It has conditioned you to make compromises in your quality of life for no legitimate reason, just the corporate greed trying to leach upon your every moment of the day. Don't let them do it. The 'free' Pandora is a preview service only for your introduction to the concept. Pay the $36/yr for Pandora One, sending a clear message you value your time and dignity too much to be force fed advertisments. Reviews here keep saying there is no way to turn it off but on my Kindle Fire HD there are at least 3 ways I came across with only a minute's effort. You can hit the pause button during a song to stop it. You can explore the icons on the screen and find several ways to log off. Of course this means you must re-enter your email and password later so I just hit the pause button. If you don't like the occasional prompts that ask if you are still there, send the following message to Pandora Customer Support: ""I don't care what you pay in royalties, just charge us what you must to provide completely uninterrupted service like other services and satellite radio offers."" Take charge of your technology, don't let your technology take charge of you!"
"November 5, 2015","I wish it would just be sam smith and that's it"
"March 16, 2015","I love using this app. It has all the stations that I love to listen to, and has great music to."
"April 27, 2016","great app"
"November 27, 2013","Pandora is the BEST online radio EVER! It has all my favorites and all the best genres! Pandora has a song for everything walking the dogs, twerking, parties, games, or just listening!"
"April 10, 2015","I love being able to customize music stations and having the option to exclude any cursing!"
"January 6, 2014","Pandora is just an awesome app I get yo listen to all my favorite songs and even new favorites it even has stations that will express your feelings at the moment I love Pandora!"
"December 2, 2015","It's very good when I have time to listen"

"July 8, 2013","I sincerely appreciate the quick response and remedy to my problem.....Amazon recommended to contact the Pandora support team and provided the address...I was plesantly surprised to get such a quick response."
"January 25, 2016","Still have it on every device"
"January 17, 2013","She had plans to burn all this music for her new 3.6 Galaxy Player she received for Christmas and hasn't burned one song since downloading this app. Nice as it keeps me from doing most of the burning. Thanks Pandora for keeping my nights free!"
"April 22, 2016","Excellent."
"May 2, 2014","This application is a must for any device. Free music, can't get any better than that. Advertisements are annoying, but all things considered, a great deal."
"May 9, 2015","I love it, but sometimes it gets annoying when it keeps asking if I'm still listening"
"March 25, 2014","The music is clear and enjoyable. There's no interruptions and me and family love the station. U can get any Station u want to hear. Rather its latin Or country."
"June 25, 2013","I love the Pandora app because it lets you listen to customized radio stations. I listen to it often and am considering paying to upgrade to the paid version without ads although the ads are not that annoying."
"February 16, 2016","Love the Classic country"
"April 26, 2016","great app"
"January 22, 2015","was a little annioning around Christmas they didn't seem to want to play anything except christmas music?"
"July 25, 2013","This app is a nifty program! I was looking for an all-in-one app (something like iTunes-but they dont make iTunes for my device), and this one came closest to the mark. You can listen three ways: --Upload all your own music --Purchase music from Pandora --Listen to unlimited, free music in the form of ""radio stations""  The feature I like the most is the Radio Station ""maker"". You can make custom lists of songs that Pandora will play in sequence, and it does NOT have to be music you already own or have to buy.  For example, if you like a specific genre of music, you can choose that search feature, Pandora will go out and grab music that falls into the category and make you a radio station of it. If it brings in a song you dislike-you click on ""skip"" button and it will be discarded from your station.  You can also rate songs so the app will learn what interests you.  You can make other radio stations (and keep the many different stations you make in a library) by using your own music or by combining yours with Pandora's.  You can make radio stations of a single band, specific genre's, or many other different ways. It's a great app to find music you are thinking about purchasing and listen to all of it first, or to find music you haven't heard yet from a band you love, and even find other bands you've never heard before based on music you like.  The app comes in a free, ad-based version (the ad's are NOT annoying and relentless), or you can get a paid app. The one I use is the free one, and you barely notice the ad's and infrequent short commercials. Great music listening software!"
"September 24, 2015","Pandora is such a great app for music I love it so much!"
"June 20, 2013","this app freshly installed never worked everytime I try to run it it froze my galaxy tab 2and I had no problems with any other apps just this one"
"February 2, 2014","I like Pandora because it is able to anticipate the artists you like from the first pick on. From Lynard Skynard to start it picked up most of the other music that I liked."
"December 1, 2013","Perfect for Kindle. I need to see if I can get the matching blocker app for the stupid ""Are you still listening"" breaks though. Overall, I'm happy. Convenient and easy to use."
"March 29, 2014","This app is so amazing u get to listen to music for FREE!!!!!!!!! No other music app has ever provided me with such opportunity for music,and I really like music."
"May 17, 2014","I recommend Pandora strongly and listen to it exclusively instead of radio. It is worth paying for a subscription to get rid of those pesky commercials."
"January 21, 2014","great selection of music. easy to program your likes./dislikes. I noticed a lot of live music recordings which is great but on some selections the studio version much better."

"March 20, 2013","it is wonderful to be able to hear gospel music in the back ground when I am on the computer. What I don't like is it is not easy to get Pandora on my Kindle after I turn it off. It is not easy to get back to the music."
"November 20, 2014","Knows your mood better than you do lol. chooses songs pretty well, good interface. Ads are always an annoyance though"
"November 21, 2015","Great music all the time - where ever I go."

"May 17, 2016","good"
"April 29, 2016","Love it!"
"February 6, 2014","Excellent when traveling to areas where radio reception is poor. Personalized music is great! Play on Kindle then connect to vehicle radio with a simple plug; wonderful!"

"January 13, 2013","The speakers on the Kindle Fire HD are incredible, so the Pandora app works very well. I use Pandora on my I-Phone, I-Pad, and now my Kindle Fire HD. It is an added benefit because I was to use my Kindle Fire for reading books only."

"March 15, 2015","Too many songs that I am not interested in hearing. I want more control over what I listen to."

"April 4, 2014","You can select the the music you want to hear and listen to. When you put on the radio you have to listen to what the radio station wants/selects. I like listening to soothing music at times and do not find the music of today soothing. Sometimes I like popular music, other times I want to listen to classic or Broadway plays music, it is all there at your finger tips. Pandora is like having your own collection of music. I pick and choose what I want to listen to. I give Pandora a very earned 5-star rating. I only wish my Kindle was able to give more volume (I hope Kindle reads this).."
"September 10, 2013","I love music--being a Christian I love contemporary Christian music and they have a station for that! I love oldies and classical too and there are many stations for those too. I don't like the ads--there seem to be too many political ones--but I don't dislike them enough to pay money to get the ad-free version. I just mute it when the ads come on."
"April 10, 2014","Good way to get the music you like to listen to. I haven't upgraded to ad free listening but they dont play many ads anyway. It's worth getting if you music."
"February 15, 2013","This is pretty good but just one thing,on my country station an Eminim song came up and I was like wtf? Other than that I love it, got it on my computer and my Andriod tablet. When I upgrade my car stereo it' s going there too."

"December 22, 2014","Great stations, and a variety of music selections. Pandora is relaxing and exciting depending on your mood."
"February 2, 2014","If you love listening to music you will really enjoy this app. I cannot spend a day without playing at least one of my stations. You decide what you want to listen to."

"September 4, 2013","Now I know what I've been missing. I'm listening to music that I have not heard in years and some I've never heard. I'm impressed and the ads are far less than regular radio. I'm happy with it."
"August 10, 2014","It is a great app that allows you to pick and choose the music you desire instead of a plethora of music from a typical radio station."
"March 14, 2016","Love my Music~!"

"February 6, 2016","Did not play any music."
"May 16, 2014","The music that is played is some of the best music you can ask for thru different stations no matter what kind of music you might enjoy Pandora has it"
"January 14, 2014","This is such a great app for listening to music. It is really fun to discover new music through Pandora and I love that you can skip over songs that you don't want to hear."
"December 28, 2013","Minimal advertisements for free streaming music. Far better than XM & doesn't require any additional hardware. Music selections reasonably follow genre & tempo of base song."
"March 4, 2015","Can't go wrong with Pandora!! Great for music lovers who want to hear what they want to hear!!"

"May 31, 2015","not happy with the quality of music choppy over wifi an full lte cell service"
"September 26, 2013","Very good, the adds are annoying but not too bad. Pandora plus is terrible since you still have a limit on skipping. All paying for Pandora does is make so you have one or two adds left out."
"February 27, 2014","I love Pandora, always plays my favorite music and I love that I hear songs that I haven't heard in forever and love and I love that it plays current popular songs."

"December 3, 2015","Love this, listen to it every morning"

"December 3, 2015","I AM HAVING ALOT OF PROBLEMS WITH IT."
"February 20, 2015","I love Pandora. So far, they have all my favorite music. Even stuff none of my friends listen to."

"March 20, 2016","Love Pandora!"
"September 6, 2014","Awesome app for a month, then they keep playing the same old songs and you get more and more ads. I am not paying to remove ads."
"August 18, 2013","Pandora seems to work just fine on my new Kindle Fire HD. It's like having an unlimited library of music at my finger tips, and I get to decide on what music I get to hear. Who could ask for more?"
"March 21, 2013","I can not say enough good things about Pandora radio. I have come to depend on Pandora for my music rather than the regular over the air radio. I love that I can create multiple channels for my different moods. LOVE IT!!!"

"September 10, 2014","I really enjoy this app but..... it gets a little slow. im not being negative but it doesn't let me follow people back anymore"
"August 20, 2014","App is relatively useless. Stalls 30 seconds between tunes. Burns battery power more than my previous version...totally unusable."
"October 1, 2014","Love the Christian music! Great app. Thanks Pandora! Thanks to God for technology that helps us grow in the faith of Jesus!"
"February 12, 2016","Too many commercials!"

"December 28, 2013","Could be a nice app. It seems a little clumsy to navigate and will require some getting used to. I thought you could choose individual songs but is not offered that way."
"March 18, 2013","The music of whatever you are interested in, or were interested in, right at your finger tip. I listened while I painted a room and the time flew by. We listen while cleaning, building puzzles or anytime. Very relaxing."
"August 31, 2015","Like Pandora. Can pick our own music. Dislike the adds."
"January 24, 2016","great for any music lover"
"June 21, 2013","While I understand the idea behind the algorithm, it's rather annoying to select a certain artist and be given tunes by others. That said, I believe Pandora is an amazing system and it's fun to experiment."
"December 16, 2013","we listen to this all the time when not watching tv. just think, you don't have to buy any more cd's.we love the old time country music and know it is one of the best aps. ever"

"January 26, 2013","I like it. I'm Anna. I am 8. It keeps skipping, though. I use my dad's Facebook page, but my own email address. I like this app, but when I use headphones, it skips. I am listening to it right now!! Tis the season for donuts. :)"
"March 7, 2013","Pandora is simply amazing as one of the best Apps of all time...Never skips, or stops in a middle of song, or has to load any material...The variety of genres is awesome..The only downfall is the ads, but it is worth it!!!"
"February 2, 2014","I thought this app was extremely easy to use. You set up a music style you enjoy, and Pandora does all of the work. I've encountered lots of new artists in this way."
"March 2, 2016","Love my Pandora!"
"October 22, 2013","Iheartradio is much better and the commercials are less intrusive.  Quit using Pandora and went back to Iheartradio; much better choice in music and live radio and talk radio."

"October 11, 2014","I love how it has all my favorite songs and artists :) and even if you ran out of skips you can still change the channel"
"February 18, 2014","I think it is great. Music plays randomly.you can choose your type of music or artist it great when riding in the bus or train. You csn not really choose the songs."

"April 12, 2016","love it"
"January 14, 2014","I rated pandora with four stars because of how easy it is to find and listen to the various music genres and the way it can pick out artists for your listening pleasures"
"March 24, 2015","I find it difficult to navigate and add music and artists etc. Not user friendly for me."
"March 13, 2016","Wonderful app"
"May 17, 2015","I like Pandora you can pick your own music from the past to now to listen to."
"March 18, 2016","Enjoying it!"
"December 21, 2014","I really think that this app is one of the best music apps I have downloaded yet. Thank you Pandora u rock"

"June 5, 2014","Great option of music, I love a variation of genres and pandora has it all. I will make sure to tell all my friends about pandora music station."
"November 12, 2015","Love Pandora, Chosen music to my mood!!!"
"February 1, 2016","We love our Pandora ❤️"
"August 20, 2013","It's A Good App , Before I Updated It. Then That's When The Problems Started ... It Wouldn't Let Me Listen To Music. Or It Would But Then It'll Freeze And Stop. Not Loving The New Update .. Sorty"
"March 28, 2015","It's very awesome and gives you good music. Rate is ten starz its awesome😁😁😁😁😁"
"August 30, 2015","I listen to Pandora every night, I really enjoy it......"
"July 22, 2016","Deleted because they said my account was compromised. I had noticed charges to my paypal. Several small ones that I did not recognize. I only downloaded it for My Echo."
"January 5, 2016","best music app on the market"
"January 14, 2013","The title says it all. Music is my emotional crutch and pandora has always been there to satisfy my need while i was docked up at work or home. Now, I have the luxury of extending that comfort wherever I go thanks to pandora app!"
"December 2, 2013","I dont live in the Us and this app cannot be used in my county... too bad:( i need to look for something else"
"February 5, 2016","Just started using it"
"March 22, 2013","New music is what I really need and Pandora has introduced me to some great stuff. I stream it on my phone at work, in the car or on my bike and pretty much anywhere I go.  So far, so good. I like the way Pandora chooses music for me based on my selections. I've learned of lots of performers I didn't know before that are a lot like my favorites. Most of the time it chooses well, but if it doesn't I can unlike that track and the program learns better what I do like. It's a great alternative to regular radio stations because I don't like commercials or annoying DJ's.  After signing up for a month of Pandora, I've decided to opt for a whole year so I won't be without it."
"February 5, 2016","It knows what I like."
"November 20, 2015","Easy a to listen to a variety of music"
"May 12, 2013","I do like the music on Pandora, but on my Kindle I ended up with a lot of annoying pop up ads I don't have with my other versions. So, while I do enjoy getting my own (style of) music, the pop ups are annoying."
"March 12, 2016","Great variety"
"June 25, 2013","I like the choice of music. However it is hard to navigate between genres and there are a lot of ads. It is still better than nothing and it is free, Maybe at some point I will upgrade to a paying member."
"February 18, 2016","Pandora is so cool"
"January 31, 2016","its really really good"
"April 6, 2016","Love it!"
"June 9, 2014","I love this app. So easy to use just put in the artist you like and they with stream songs from similar artist and make a great playlist."
"January 28, 2014","I just love listening to the songs and if I don't know the words, they are there for me to view. I also love having the history of the song and bio of the artist."
"January 11, 2014","It's easy to get started and I get to listen to my kind of music without having to choose each and every song. When it's time for a change, I just create another station."
"March 12, 2015","I like Pandora, however; I used to pay yearly. Now it's monthly. I'm not pleased with that."
"March 25, 2014","I love finding out about the artists and the lyrics. Pandora also is widening the scope of music I enjoy. We have it set up on the cars, the phones, & TVS."
"October 31, 2013","Very user friendly and I love all the song selections that are available with this great app! Keep up the good work!"
"January 11, 2014","Finally...listening to music my way, without the unnecessary noise. I encourage everyone to create the stations that will inspire and encourage the ""good"" in you."
"July 23, 2015","Excellent music and performance. Very intuitive and easy to use."
"March 16, 2016","Great music."

"March 29, 2016","Excellent"
"February 4, 2016","Really enjoy pandora."
"July 20, 2014","I love Pandora!"
"March 2, 2016","I love it! !!!"
"March 2, 2016","Best music ever"
"November 2, 2014","Pandora doesn't give you the band or person you enter in the search. It gives you 'similar' artists. Very annoying."
"February 2, 2014","it was pretty good when i played my first 2 songs but after that when i tapped a song i wanted to listen to, it started playing a completely different song!!!! >:("
"February 22, 2016","Great music. Free"

"October 6, 2014","I love it absolutely the best app I have downloaded so far I love it so much I'm using it right now why I'm writing this"
"March 15, 2015","Not what I thought it was, wanted to build a library not listen to one song over and over."
"March 23, 2016","VERY GOOD"
"April 30, 2014","I paid for the upgrade to Pandora one and I gotta say I love it...... I use it several hours a day at home, at work, school and especially on the road"

"January 6, 2016","Have always enjoyed Pandora"
"March 26, 2013","I love being able to listen to the music I choose and not having commercials every other song. I also really like the suggestions that Pandora makes and being able to read the lyrics and bios."
"March 24, 2015","I don't have it myself but a friend who I gave the Kindle Fire HD to has it and likes it"
"August 17, 2015","Use this app constantly. Works great I just hate the adds."
"July 27, 2013","It works as it's supposed to but after a while it turns black and I have to quit the app and start over. Sometimes it doesn't start up at all. So when is the update coming out? Thanks for your time."
"September 9, 2015","Excellent source of music to hear where ever you are."
"December 29, 2012","I have Pandora installed on my older model computer and had trouble with smooth streaming. With the Kindle Fire, the songs stream smoothly. If you're not familiar with Pandora, it is a program that allows you to choose the type of music you want to hear. I started with a favorite musician and put that name in my ""Station"". After that song ended, Pandora played a song from another artist of that genre. If I gave the song a thumbs up, the song continued and more of the new artist's songs would eventually be played on my ""station."" If I gave it a thumbs down, the song immediately stopped playing and Pandora went on to another artist and another song. I now have several ""stations"" -- one for relaxation music, one for blues, one for classical, one for country, etc. Pandora works great with Kindle Fire... Of course, the sound system isn't a Bose, so if your a musical purist, you shouldn't expect great surround sound.  I really don't see how anyone can go wrong with downloading and using Pandora."
"February 24, 2016","Always worth it."
"June 16, 2014","I have Pandora on all my other devices; it just dawned on me that I could also put it on my Kindle! Great selection of music and easy to use."
"January 8, 2013","App will continue to play for multiple hours before asking if you are there. I use this app on my phone while it is plugged into my house speaker system and broadcast music all over the house while working. Minimal commercials."
"December 27, 2015","Best thing since sliced bread"
"April 25, 2016","Yes"
"August 12, 2015","I love pandora and listen to a variety of music every day.."
"February 10, 2016","Very useable format"
"November 16, 2015","Seriously, who doesn't love Pandora?!?"
"February 4, 2014","I had used Pandora on My Chrome book all the time, when u think of artist or a song all u have to do it type it and it is there, from all eras of music. Use it often"
"September 18, 2013","I give it 3 stars because the music and playlists are good but the commercials are terrible! You can download other apps that don't have any commercials that are just as good if not better."
"April 11, 2015","This app is great you can choose any song or type of song you want I love it so much"
"March 12, 2016","Love pandora"
"March 30, 2016","POtatoes"
"March 30, 2016","Love it!"
"November 23, 2014","It's good and all but I don't like if you want to go to persons radio sometimes it plays someone music 3stars"
"September 12, 2015","It is great I luv it so amazing git it now!!;)so fun"
"May 2, 2014","well Pandora is amazing!!it has the best hits me and my friend love this app it was also free so u do not have too pay anything so get Pandora today!"
"January 13, 2015","PANDORA KINDA SUX THEY PLAY S***TY MUSIC AND THE SAME SOMGS OVER AND OVER ITUNES radio IS BETTER BYE"
"September 17, 2015","I love it except the adds but I know they need them"
"March 29, 2016","Love it!"
"February 25, 2014","I love pandora because it doesnt have a limit to how much music you listen to anything you want .But you do have a limit to how many times you can skip a song!!!"
"July 4, 2015","Just got it on my new truck. Will see how much data I use with it."
"February 10, 2014","Great app. Once you get the hang of using it. Always a great selection of songs. I also enjoy the interesting info. They provide on each artist. But the pop up ads are annoying."
"March 29, 2016","Awesome!"
"November 19, 2015","I love Pandora. All my stations Rock!"
"March 2, 2016","I love Pandora"
"April 2, 2012","I really enjoy using pandora. The only problem I have is that the commercials are interfering with the app. Before the song is done playing a commercial comes on and ruins the whole song. I understand the reasons for commercials, but how about after the songs over?"
"March 2, 2016","Love it. Easy."
"February 17, 2016","clear. I like it."
"December 1, 2013","With Pandora's personal playlist, I never get bored or tired of the same old songs. I get to hear my favorites alongside new music and obscure artists not played on the radio."
"May 12, 2014","i finally downloaded this program and wish I had done it sooner...love the variety of music,ease of use and i can have the music I want at anytime."
"April 8, 2015","Pandora is just great! I like music to be playing when I'm working,and Pandora is not the easiest to get going quick, but they also play songs by the artists I select that I don't even have in my extensive collection. I like the fact that you can select artists and they create a whole station around them and artists that are similar. Their picks for extra artists are generally very good--many artists I like are already included with others I've chosen. The few short commercials are hardly a bother, and they play long cuts uninterrupted."
"October 22, 2015","I love it. Can't do my workouts without it."
"January 3, 2016","listen to it often+++++++++"
"April 18, 2016","Easy"

"December 30, 2013","We love Pandora and pay for a subscription. This is a good app. Problem is that you still can't skip after so many songs even with subs. Atleast there are not ads though."
"January 14, 2014","Pandora gives me the option to listen to many different genres of music whenever I like. And I can listen to it anywhere I'm able to access the Pandora application."

"June 1, 2013","I love that Pandora lets you pick your stations to create.Also you get to listen to different songs in that genre.Only way you can get no ads to pop up is pay for the 1year sevice or monthly service."
"January 14, 2014","Once you set up your preferred playlist on Pandora, you can listen for hours and hours and almost never hear a song you don't like. This is a must-have music app!"

"September 19, 2013","I initially downloaded this to listen to the songs from the show Nashville, then couldn't help checking out all the features and adding more music to my station for the mood I was in."
"May 8, 2017","I've used Pandora for years and I can't imagine using anything else. I love that I can just pick an artist and they provide similar artists within the station."
"June 6, 2014","There's nothing better than listening to your favorite genre of music! I love being introduced to new songs that I've never heard before!"
"March 10, 2016","love it"
"February 5, 2014","works like champ....just wise it could be set up to play an entire album from an artist, rather then alternating between similar artists...like you can on Rdio"

"April 14, 2013","Wonderful device that I can listen to any type of music I want or listen to the radio. Sometimes while reading in bed I will have Pandora on just for background noise instead of having the TV on. Great APP."
"September 29, 2013","Music variety is vast.  I wish it would play the song selected vs. ""something similar"" first.  I play songs in the background while doing other searches."
"December 23, 2015","Had it for 3years luv it"

"February 28, 2016","Greatest,"
"March 15, 2017","Great application for discovering new music. After awhile you notice the same songs get repeated by bands however."
"December 30, 2013","i really enjoy Pandora. love the thumbs down option when i very occasionally come across someting not to my liking...but in general i love almost every song i hear."
"February 1, 2016","beats the radio"

"December 4, 2015","Love the music suggestions !"
"March 3, 2016","Love it."

"February 27, 2016","very good"
"June 2, 2013","I enjoy listening to various genres and was pleased to have the ability to go from hip hop, rap then spa music. Could do without the commercials, but that's probably how they deliver great music."

"May 29, 2015","If I did have to rate it though I would still give it a 4/5 for sure"
"March 9, 2013","It does a great job of predicting what artists/songs I will like based on my history and ratings. I don't care for the ads, but I don't feel like I use it often enough to justify paying for the music without ads."
"November 1, 2015","Has all the best music I listen to!"
"March 2, 2016","Love it!"
"February 26, 2012","This site would be so much better if it didn't have so much buffering, signal drops. Once tou make a request for songs or artist to play or not, There's no recognition, songs repeat and plays anyway what it wants. This annoying, and makes me not want to listen and cut it off."
"June 7, 2014","I love hearing the music I selected. However, I am having trouble setting my choices. I also can't find my favorite station, 102.7 WPRZ."

"August 25, 2014","Great music app that targets all my favorite music! I use pandora when I am working out, reading, or studying! I love it!"
"November 14, 2015","I really enjoy the Pandora Media"
"November 23, 2015","Love the music, nothing better"
"November 5, 2014","I'm an Australian client but the log in insisted on an American address and refused access. So I got zilch."
"July 17, 2015","I LOVE MUSIC BETTER THAN THE PLAY TUBE APP FOR PLAYLISTS!!"
"January 5, 2013","this Pandora's box in the free version if you hate add's. In fact their are so many adds poping up that it takes away from the enjoyment of the music. But other wise it is a great app and will play all your favorite music."
"February 21, 2016","Great app."
"February 21, 2016","Works good"
"February 22, 2013","It sure beats listening to boring DJs and their silly childish jokes. When I look for a new car, I want to make sure I can get Pandora or Pandora One on my radio. It's easy to use and has a great variety of music."
"August 14, 2014","Does what it says. That's getting to be nice in a world of crap apps. I cross loaded on the BB10 OS and it works perfectly."
"December 29, 2014","I like Pandora, however, when I switch from Pandora to another app, Pandora stops. Not happy with that."
"June 24, 2013","It is nice to have the genre of music catagorizied with rotation of artists. Just wish the ads did not bring the session to a halt. I realize this is to encourage a purchase of the prime option."
"February 16, 2016","Great music"
"March 5, 2016","Love it"
"February 16, 2016","works great"
"February 25, 2016","excellent"
"April 13, 2015","only drawback(minor) is commercials. Easy fix don't be cheap get pandora one."
"December 28, 2015","The best app for music"
"April 3, 2015","Love Pandora! The music selections are great - and best of all....IT'S FREE!!!"

"December 23, 2015","what's not to like?! :)"
"January 4, 2015","I would like to hear more from the artist the I like and not those who could be music like them"
"December 5, 2015","Many choices of great music"
"March 23, 2015","Love it. Only minor issue is the number of commercials but they are over quickly."
"January 23, 2016","A great selection of music."
"March 24, 2016","The issues I have are with the app itself for a Kindle Fire, not necessarily for Pandora as a whole. There are certain ads you have to physically open the app for on your Fire to watch/listen to. If you don't Pandora just stops, doesn't play any more music, but stays open. There isn't any way to skip or pause the music unless you, once again, physically open the app. You can only see what song is playing and the band who performs it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu. There are some minor issues with songs randomly pausing half way through and then skipping unannounced and without prompting to the next song. The ads on this version of the app are longer and more frequent than on my Android phone, iPod or laptop versions."
"February 24, 2016","Excellent"
"November 2, 2013","For those of you who struggled getting the new Pandora open i tired turning my kindle off and then on again. That's when it finally worked. Other than that i love the update"
"July 31, 2013","Pandora saved me a bunch of money. I wanted to buy Sattelite radio, but my girlfriend wouldn't let me. So I went the Pandora route. Seems good to me. I still want sattelite radio.... but it can wait."

"February 23, 2014","This is awesome I am listening to this right now.it's awesome because you get to listen to it when you are playing games and you can blast it in the car."
"April 30, 2013","Truly enjoy the variety of stations. Even though I'm only using the free version with adds, it's still better than listening to the radio with a commercials between every song, or a DJ that can't shut up."
"April 30, 2014","Pandora is awesome on my kindle!!! I am a massage therapist so I use Pandora a lot, it works way better on my kindle than it does on my iTouch"

The only thing I have a small problem with, setting aside the fact I haven't started it yet, is the lack of a chain guard for storage. I really won't be using the line trimmer system because I already have a large cutter and would rather dough the adaptation would hold up under my usage.

"February 3, 2016","Love it!"
"January 28, 2013","Works entirely as I expected. It's easy to connect to your Pandora One account and the app moves fluidly. It's a little hard to find your way to the station details to change settings but other than that awesome."

"January 9, 2015","Love Pandora. Don't love the ads. I'm leaning more toward Amazon Prime Music these days."
"January 12, 2013","Pandora has opened up a whole new line of music for me. Choosing by artist or genre generates radio stations of my choosing. The like or dislike buttons help streamline my kind of music on stations I make for me!"

"July 15, 2014","They recently fixed a couple of bugs.It works great now. Seemless connectivity via blue tooth. The Genome thing is awesome"
"February 10, 2016","I tried to work with this app for a few days, and while the website and most of it's functions appear to work. There's just one HUGE problem; the music won't play. That's right, even though that everything else works, the music, the #1 reason why this was made and why people bother using this is that only one thing that doesn't work. It works if you turn it off and leave it alone for an hour, but if you fiddle with it in the slightest way, the next track won't play. This is just sh*tty and weird from my experience. Oh, wait. There's one more thing that doesn't work; it's the search engine for music stations, which is also a pretty vital thing about Pandora... For those who're reading this review, I really don't recommend this..."
"April 19, 2014","I know what Pandora is but it was disappointing because it kept saying at the beginning they wouldn't accept my registries please fix part"
"August 20, 2015","very good and fast service would order again"
"February 28, 2014","Free and easy. who would not love it! No monthly or annual fee. choose your favorite music and prevent songs you don't enjoy from ever playing."
"July 9, 2015","I have pandora now and i love it! So much good music."

"November 27, 2013","I love how you can listen to as many songs as you like,but the only thing I don't like are the ads. Of course, you can pay money to skip them so I give it 4 stars."

"September 20, 2013","Pandora introduces me to new music that I might never have heard on local radio. Keeps my musical listening current and fresh. I listen to hit while hiking and working out."
"December 29, 2013","This app sounds great, but I don't really use it much since I have the Sirius/XM app installed. I would use it more if I didn't have a pay service, but there are a couple of things I am not crazy about: 1) Ads, but nothing you can do about that; and 2) when I select an artist to start with, it seems they don't play very much from that artist, and the number of other artists they play is very limited. For example, I ask for a station to begin with Rush, and I'll hear a Rush song to start with, but not again for 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, I'll hear a couple of songs from Led Zeppelin, a couple from the Rolling Stones, and maybe 2 or 3 more artists, and no others. So maybe this app is not for me."
"January 28, 2016","Amazing!"

"September 10, 2014","This is a great music outlet! It allows you many hours of listening to any genre you choose! Lots of fun!"
"January 29, 2014","I use Pandora on my smartphone when I'm not in my car which has satellite radio. It works great on wifi or 4G networks available nearly everwhere."
"July 4, 2015","So far very happy with all that I have purchased"
"December 31, 2013","Great music choices from country to my Hawaiian and hapa tunes. Keith Urban to Frank Sinatra to Izzy and more. Easy to change and create what you want."
"March 1, 2015","Love it!! I've had pandora on my phone and home computer for 3 years now."

"December 30, 2015","Excellent"
"October 9, 2013","Sometimes it takes a long time for Pandora to start. I'd like to be able to play a certain song sometimes too and there's no control over that --not that I know of."
"January 6, 2015","Love my music channels.great you make custom channels for your own taste in music."

"February 20, 2014","I love this site.You can pick any kind of music you want, and if you get the premium edition, you can listen commercial-free.Money well spent."
"March 25, 2014","I really love Pandora! It's basic but sometimes that's all you really need. Love the playlist & artists you love all at your fingertips."
"August 6, 2015","I think Pandora is the best option for listening to music, other than maybe the actual radio. The commercial breaks aren't that long, and they aren't ridiculously frequent. You can control exactly what kind of music you listen to, and there's no limit on how many channels you can have. There's the skip button for when you hear a track way too often, although there is a limit on how many times you can use that. Of course, there's always the alternative (and unlimited) way to skip a song: just change stations. All in all, I can't think of anything bad about Pandora, other than the fact that if you don't have internet you can't use it. But, most devices have mobile data and/or a personal hotspot, so if you REALLY feel the need to listen, you can. I love Pandora!"
"February 7, 2016","Poorly performed."
"December 3, 2015","Love my Pandora"

"May 18, 2013","Not much to say about this app. A must have on any device. If you love music, this is the one to put on your smart phone your tablet. Rock-on!! Any song, any artist is there. Get it!!"
"March 27, 2013","Sure there are a few commericals now and then but nothing like radio. Plus I don't have to listen to crap I don't like. I pick the ""flavor"" of music by bands I like, and that's what I get."

"July 26, 2014","I took it off my kindle right away. It asked for my e.mail pass word. Clear and unacceptable invasion of privacy."
"August 24, 2013","After downloading, Pandora screen came up and that was it. Uninstalled and reinstalled app and same result. Guess I need more info on getting it to open so I can sign in."
"December 1, 2015","Plays hits only"

"November 29, 2015","Works well!"
"May 19, 2014","This is a great app if you want to discover new bands. It has a radio system for bands and genres. Each station has about five bands that are similar to the main band on that station. It mixes songs from those bands in with the band you know, so you hear songs that you might like. This app helped me discover 5 new bands that I really like. The major problem I seem to have is that even if a band has 6 albums, I constantly plays the same 10-15 songs. This really annoys me because if I look on youtube for songs from said band, I see all these songs I never knew existed and I very well might like better than what i hear on pandora. I know pandora has them in their library because if I look at the album information, I can get 30 second samples of songs. It doesn't seem that hard to just randomly pick any of the 50 songs that a band might have."

"August 20, 2013","This app is fantastic for creating custom radio stations that have great variety. We have created many custom stations to fit all of our moods and different occasions."
"April 22, 2014","Enjoy being able to select what you like. Found it enjoyable to be able to have the right music wherever you go. Great media."
"October 23, 2015","My ace in the hole!"

"June 24, 2014","Pandora allows one to hear the music one likes and not the music of just one radio station. Glad it is available."
"October 12, 2015","Won't let me register"
"June 27, 2015","LOVE being able to listen to tunes i choose."
"January 1, 2014","You get to design your own station by songs picks, type or musician. If you don't like a song you can tell them not to play it on your station."

"November 15, 2012","Seriously Pandora, where did the Exit or Quit button go for the app on the Kindle Fire HD? The only way to stop is to go into the app settings and forceclose it... But then it might ""Misbehave"" haha.. It's already misbehaving!! While you are fixing that glitch, you might want to consider a sleep timer. That would be a wonderful addition to your app...  adding one extra star, the menu button is now fixed on the Kindle Fire, now we can ""quit"" instead of forceclosing, thank you. A sleep timer will complete the app and make it 5 star!  I am not sure about the problems others are having, songs not completing, ads, etc. All my stations play perfectly, always have. as far as ads, I am usually doing something besides staring at the album art so I rarely notice the ads, sometimes there is a break for an audible ad, but no big deal. If the ads bother you, it's easy to fix, just get the paid app. After several hours of using the app it will pause and ask if you are still listening. All you got to say is yes or no... if you aren't it will stay paused. no big deal and I appreciate that."
"August 10, 2013","So happy with Pandora. I can listen to just about any song and it is free. Subscription, which frees it of ads is low cost. I do not mind the ads as the are very short."
"December 1, 2015","Love it!!"
"October 2, 2015","This is an amazing app"
"February 15, 2014","I like this music app but one suggestion I have is when I chose a song I want that song to play not a song like it. Otherwise I love it."

"July 1, 2014","This app. requires that you watch and listen to lengthy advertisements before you listen to your music choices"
"February 26, 2013","The application works fine, so or $0 it does what it should. The Pandora site itself does not have quite as extensive a collection as I would like, but for the money, I find it well worth it."
"May 24, 2014","I LISTEN TO THE MUSIC AT WORK. I LOVE IT. GREAT LISTENING. VERY REALAXING. MUSIC IS GREAT. I LOVE THE EASY LISTENING."
"December 14, 2013","I downloaded this app and was pleased to see that it has a sleep timer and other features not offered on my nook app. However, as one reviewer mentioned, it seemed to just lock up when I tried to open it for the second time. What I did was to remove it from my device and reload it everytime I wanted to use it. That was a bit of a hassle, I thought, but yesterday I realized in frustration when it came up with the pandora screen and I just tapped that screen, it opened. Boy, did I feel silly! In my defense, I am over 50 and what is supposed to be ""intuitive"" to many isn't ""intuitive"" to me. Anyway, I'm thrilled that I figured that out and am now able to listen to all my channels on the great speakers on my Kindle Fire HD. I would have rated it with 5 stars except that there are more adds on this free version than on my free nook app."
"December 11, 2013","What else can anyone say about Pandora, It's simply the best app to hear your favorite songs and customize your listening experience. Just get it!"

"June 27, 2015","I can get classical music when I want it."
"September 28, 2016","The service is an amazing idea, and I used to enjoy it. However, they let so many violent and pro-rape tracks slip through the cracks. I wrote to them, and, of course, the representative had to defend free speech and their policy on their ""comedy"" selection. Freedom of speech is an essential component of our culture, but companies and individuals must take responsibility for what's clearly right and wrong."
"November 20, 2013","This is a great app I think they should have more updates that make this app better Go on and make more and tech... help our work become better"

"December 28, 2012","I love this application! I am able to listen to the music of my own choosing with limited interruptions. It is easy to find my favorite artists and save their music. Love Love Love this application!"
"July 10, 2015","Kept rejecting any attempts to sign up"

"December 5, 2012","I love that Pandora alows you to pick a style of music and plays music that is similar. It allows me to experience music that I may not have tried since the radio sticks to the same songs over and over."

The interface is clean and very simple to use. The outstanding feature that sets Pandora apart is the ability to shuffle play multiple artists. I like my Sinatra right next to my Ramones right next to my John Williams, and this is a feature that requires a subscription on other music streaming apps. Like The Beatles? They're available on Pandora."

"November 19, 2014","Works fine as a music player but why does Pandora need permissions to so much personal data?  “Allows this app to access your pictures, music, documents, and other files stored on your device, at a remote storage provider, on a media card, or in the cloud”  “Allows this app to access your devices current or saved locations”  “Allows this app to identify when you are on a call, and to access identifiers such as your device phone number, and device ID username”  Unacceptable & therefore deleted."

"July 18, 2015","Music music music. What can I say?"
"January 9, 2014","Seems like they repeat a lot of the same songs. Maybe a little more variety or bring in some new artists that maybe like the chosen ones."

"January 15, 2014","I've been using this app for years. These days, many people seem to be turning to Spotify. But Pandora does not hammer you with so much in the way of intrusive advertising. The algorithm sometimes makes what seem like odd choices of related music and artists, but in the end I'm very impressed with how well it does. If you take the time to actually thumbs-up and tumbs-down tunes you like and don't like (respectively), over time you will build stations that suit your taste exactly. And one of the nicest features is discovering tunes and musicians you love that you probably never would have discovered otherwise. I'm an Android user, and the app works seamlessly on my phone."
"May 14, 2015","The music genome project gets better every day."

"January 31, 2014","The variety is great, options of how you want things are played etc. The 3.99 to have commercial free, uninterrupted play is worth it."
"December 31, 2014","Pandora seems really good, but I have only just started to listen to it."
"April 9, 2014","I question the choices that emerge as associated artists at times, but for a free service I think this is generally great."

"December 27, 2013","Downloaded quickly to my device. Very easy to use. Love the customizable abilities of Pandora. Looking forward to lots of good music."
"May 27, 2013","I have used Pandora since around 2006. It seemed at that time (in my experience)Pandora was one of the only services offering free streaming of music based on user input. I have Pandora One and I am disappointed that despite changing my settings to allow explicit content many of the songs are edited. It seems that the same songs are played several times over, even within a few hours. I still use Pandora Radio but I am losing enthusiasm fast. There are now many other similar services that offer a much greater selection of songs. I have tried several of the other services and the music has much more variety on many of the other services.  _Bottom Line_ I would carefully compare all services before committing to one. There are now so many to choose from and each service has its limitations. Each service also has its perks too. Do some research and find out what fits best. Yes, I still recommend Pandora Radio to friends but I no longer recommend paying for the service. This review is based on my own opinion, individual experience, and style. I do not believe this is a one size fits all."

"July 22, 2015","Commercials are annoying!!!!!"
"January 7, 2014","A radio that plays what you want and if you do play a song you don't like thumps down and it is gone! What more could you ask for!!!!"

"July 16, 2014","Great app but I wish the radio stations that I created stayed more on que to the artist I selected."
"May 1, 2017","I've always loved the service, and the app works without a hitch. The only reason Pandora gets four stars instead of five is that I'm reserving my five star rating, in the area of music streaming services, for a service that has a genuinely global catalog. I am aware it would likely take international treaty action on the part of the world's governments to achieve this goal... but that's what I want."

"July 10, 2015","I love Pandora, and have been using it for many years - this is the first year I've had a tablet and was very exciting to discover Pandora. Artists, Songs, Genres are easy to find and use - especially for those of us who are technically-challenged. My little complaint is that I can't always ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" a song...what is equally nice and sometimes frustrating, is this app allows you to listen to music while doing other things on your tablet. Minor quirks aside - I'm very happy with this app and would recommend to anyone!"
"October 22, 2015","Like it"
"October 22, 2015","Love it"

"May 26, 2014","Yes, Pandora lets you hear free music right from . The radio! No more buying music when you have Pandora!!!"
"June 6, 2014","Need to work with it more. Not finding enough music I like. I have eclectic taste when it comes to music."

"July 11, 2013","I am not going to rate the Pandora website, their music selection or how they operate. This rating is for the application only. I suspect those wanting to get this application already know about Pandora, they don't need me to rate the website.  My wife enjoys this application more than I do since she's the one with the Pandora account. She's able to listen to her Pandora music even while she uses her Kindle to read a book. I would have been happy if this app had to open with no other app running, providing it worked. But this app goes beyond and has earned the 5 star rating hands down. My wife is VERY happy with this app.  Works well on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9."

"December 12, 2012","Teaching the folks in my office to use Pandora on their individual computers has saved me from overhead/overall radio music (so not my taste) all day every day at work. Now, we each hear what we want to hear and nothing else.  At home, we stream Pandora through an iPod using BlueTooth into the stereo that plays throughout the house. That has saved us from getting bored with our own (extensive, but too familiar) music collection.  One of the most fun things we have done with Pandora was to pass the iPod around at a party for friends to start new ""Pandora radio stations"" for us by selecting musicians who were new to us. Found a world of great music that way.  LOVE Pandora."

"February 6, 2014","Great variety of tunes! Not too many adds butting into your listening either. I would recommend. Great on our kindle fire"

"April 27, 2016","I have used the free version and paid version. I enjoyed both!! When you pick specific artists and create stations it does a good job at playing music in that same genre. I have used this app faithfully for years. The thumbs up and down option is great for customizing the station even more to your own personal liking. It keeps songs you really like replaying in the mix without over playing them. But, also adds new songs to the mix as well."
"August 11, 2014","It is so gimmick free and so focused on the user enjoyment that I am a longtime friend!"

"February 20, 2015","I give 4 stars, the only thing are the ad pop-ups."
"July 10, 2015","This is an awesome application as everyone knows. It works but too many apps. So if you got 5$ a month to pay for add-free music go ahead. The only bad thing about this service is the limit of it's music. It only has only 1 million songs. (It's true; search it up.) Meaning that after a while of listening to a station for so long you start noticing the same songs coming on. Easy product but it's limited. This is why I use Spotify. Spotify has 20 million songs. So pay 5 dollars for music that you can't really look for specifically or pay 10 dollars a month for no adds unlimited listening and search and play exact songs. Now I just sound like a Spotify employee lmao. Anywho, Spotify is better."
"August 31, 2015","LOVE, LOVE!"
"December 15, 2013","I'm a late-comer to Pandora. I subscribed about a month ago and have told my friends about it because it's made a big improvement in my life. That sounds melodramatic but it's true. I have always been a music lover and studied classical piano seriously when I was young. A few years ago I developed a physical condition that required me to quit working, limit my driving and avoid crowds. I'm living on a shoestring. And I live way out in the sticks. There's no cell reception, cable or public transportation here. On Pandora I set up six stations to fit my taste in music. The first day I set up a station combining piano jazz and classical piano. I listened to it day in and day out until I felt satisfied. Next I went to blues and folk. Yesterday I listened to my favorite rock + roll for hours and learned about music that is new to me. That's part of the reason I like Pandora so much -it combines what I know with new choices. Also, the quality of Pandora 's sound is first rate. I took the upgrade right away - it's an inexpensive way to get rid of ads."
"August 14, 2014","I enjoy listening to Pandora wherever I am withought bulky boom box or other devices."

"June 1, 2013","This is a very good source for quality music listening. There are other competitors out there, but Pandora ranks right at the top. Excellent product to support."
"February 27, 2014","I love Pandora... but recently, it's not as great. When I start it up, it takes 3-5 tries to get a song to play. After a few songs it stops playing. It's disappointing to know such a great app can have so many glitches.  It's not like I don't like Pandora, because I really do. I like how it's free but of course, free is limited... but to be honest, you can do lots of things users that pay them can. For once. It's great to know that I can listen to certain music instead of a mix.  Overall I love it! :)"
"August 7, 2015","Love it! Thanks."

Type in the artist name and hear their music plus others like them. I'm a fan of TuneIn and I find Pandora a nice alternative. If you enjoy a variety of music then download this app. The down side-it cuts off after a while if you're not a paid subscriber. Not a deal breaker but me personally, I have a problem paying for radio. Lol...maaybe I'mjust getting old but hey, I remember when the radio use to be free."

Could you make it so you could browse for a specific song instead of waiting for it to pop up on the station? Also, it be nice if you could organize the things you like and don't like. I like to be organized, so it be nice if I could organize all of my favorite songs in a ranked order. Thanks."

"April 27, 2014","I just recently signed up for Pandora and have not had the time to give you a fair, evaluation of what Pandora has to offer, at not monthly cost to me. Several of my friends have subscribed to other stations that offer what Pandora offers, but at monthly charge rates that can add up over the course of a years time.  I have chosen several programs, on Pandora that meet my listening needs and have added peace and soothing my mind over sometimes stressful times and also offered me music of many music artists that I grew with when I was younger and are much more soothing than much of what I hear, on the general FM stations today.  I look forward to listening more to Pandora in the future. Keep up the good broadcasting services you now are offering.  The world today can be a hectic environment and peaceful music is more than appreciated by me and others that also carry many of the portable devices, like a Kindle Hd or I Pads.  Thanks for your current music services.  Dennis Ryan, Tampa, Fl"

"October 19, 2015","It does have some problems that are most likely due to network and wifi issues. As a older user I enjoy the feature that shows you similar artists that you have never heard of or only recognize by the music that you hear. I have added many channels that feature artist/groups that I learned about on Pandora. I have Pandora One which for $ 4.99 a month keeps me up with the new music that is out there. This is really great when you around younger people and you name groups that they all like....hmmm keeps me young and is saying ""Cool"" still Cool? I sure hope so, but if not I guess I could say "":Sick"" and know that might be cool??? Dancingron"

"May 6, 2016","Nothing better than this app for music! I don't mind the commercials every couple of songs except for when I'm using it in the middle of the night for my year old baby boy, playing the soothing sounds and then REALLY LOUD commercials jerk him awake. I just put it on really low volume now but then he doesn't really get the full effect. I love when they offer the free hour of no commercials and get so excited when it happens at night. Other than that, I use it daily and even have profiles for my five year old girl that has her kid stations on it that she made, which is a fab feature that our entire family loves! Will be paying soon to take commercials off, but only to help with little ones music. If that wasn't the case, I would have no problem at all with not paying. So don't delay! Download today! Enjoy music for your entire family at your fingertips! It's easy to use as well and keeps all your favorites =)"

"June 13, 2015","Meh. I'm tired of clicking thumbs down on the music of Kenny Baker and Joe Venuti, which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly, I suppose because they have some kind of deal with them. What about the deal with me, a paying customer? Won't renew. Incidentally, these are just examples, not isolated cases. On stations with older music, their variety is quite limited--baroque, for example, or several of their classical stations, probably because they're focused on a young audience."

"October 14, 2013","Pandora was the first human woman created by the deities, specifically by Hephaestus and Athena on the instructions of Zeus."
"February 8, 2016","Good music player... for things not on the local device. Everything is streamed. For some, this is awesome. For others with already extensive collections, it is redundant at best.  Then, there's the randomness. You start with some single song or artist, or maybe even a vague genre as a base and it randomly tries to figure out what (based on music DNA) you might like related to that baseline. And trying to teach it some of the most-simple things like ""I hate this artist, in total"", just seem to be beyond the comprehension of the app.  Not horrible. But plenty of room for improvement."
"January 16, 2013","I switched to Pandora after Slacker failed me on the Kindle Fire. Loving it at the moment. It does have the occasional glitch/spazz out but nothing serious. I think this is about as good as it gets for free Internet Radio."

"June 8, 2015","Excellent."
"August 17, 2015","My only real complaint about Pandora is that you cannot press thumbs down an unlimited amount of times. It keeps giving me R&B type songs for some reason, and it won't let me skip them or give them a thumbs down after just a few. I also wish there were fewer live versions of songs. It is frustrating when you hear the same song in three versions in an hour. Again these are my only complaints. Other than that I love the program and much prefer it over My Heart Radio."

"January 6, 2014","I like the music, it plays a lot of good songs. But for me there are three major glitches to work out. 1.) It won't let me log back into Pandora without removing from my device and redownloading it. 2.) Half the time it won't let me listen to music, it'll say that it can't find anymore related songs to change the station, but it does that on every station and hasn't gotten any better, it's done that to me very time this week I've tried to listen. 3.) When the warning first popped up, it said I had 48 hours of free music left, so I logged out wanting to save it for long car rides, but when I logged back in a couple of days later it said I had no free music left, even though I hadn't listened to it at all. So Pandora, I'm willing to give you two stars for excellence in music, but I won't go any higher than that because of the glitches, I'd appreciate it very much if you would fix them, then maybe I can give you five stars."

"August 4, 2013","I enjoy being able to listen to any kind of station. I wish you didn't have you pay for the ad free one but all in all love it."
"December 23, 2015","Works well enough and like many Android native apps lacks the feature set for BlackBerry. That said, audio quality is excellent.  Not a 4-star product because it nags with emails to the hub! Would be 5-stars if native for BlackBerry and also not nag to emails.  ---UPDATE: June 30, 2017 - At some point, after an app update, Pandora's audio stream became flaky and unreliable resulting in frequent herky-jerky audio and frequent error messages upon attempt launch ""Pandora not responding"". Used to be able to use hihj-quality audio stream, but now even with lower quality stream problem is very frequent. Interestingly, all my other live-stream apps function great 99% of the time that I experience problems with Pandora. So, if it is related to weak cell signal, it certainly is rarely effecting other live-stream audio apps (music and voice). - Pandora used to allow users to increase buffer size to workaround such issues but no longer. - Downgraded to one-star No guidance from Pandora on this issue and referred to generic Android troubleshooting tips which were useless."

"September 14, 2014","Pandora is the BEST music app there is out there. . . . . . If you are looking for a great music app that has variety and every song you could imagine - even from artists that aren't very well known. . . . . Just to put it out there, All you need to use pandora is an email. . . . .  The only bad thing I have found about pandora is that adds are fairly frequent. To remove ads you have to upgrade to pandora one, which has a monthly fee.  I have never had pandora crash on me and no glitches. . . ..Overall great app that I would recommend to anyone. Ps.

"October 13, 2013","The songs they provide are great, it's easy to find whatever you need, but you do need an internet connection ...."
"June 28, 2013","I love rock music like Led Zeppelin. I tried to type in Led Zeppelin and my favorite song, Stairway to Heaven, but it shows a lot other music that you don't want to listen to.  ·You can type in The Beatles then Jimmy Hendrix could show up. You only get three skips to skip a song you don't like. Total rip off. You can't listen to the music you typed in; only random music of that genre.  ·Also, it doesn't even let you make a playlist of your favorite music. You will be lucky if you get a few songs by that artist or the one song you typed in. Sometimes even if you don't get the song you want, you can listen to others that you might like.  · Another flaw is that you can't listen to the same song again after you listen to it once. You cannot replay nor can you rewind or fast forwarded songs. Waste of time for those of you who want to listen to certain music. I give this 5/10."
"August 11, 2013","Pandora has a trillion songs on on station I can listen to it all day bio wish it had a rewind just like the fast forward"

"January 31, 2013","Pandora is a great app on Kindle Fire. Works very similiar to the program used on my PC.

I love all types of music so being able to pick a station that will play classic country today and Hip Hop the next is wonderful. You can even see the song lyrics while the song is being played. I just wanted the free version and not have to pay so for this feature you do have to listen to ads. I don't mind because it is worth it. Pandora is so great that I went online and ordered two portable speakers so I can really hear my music as loud as I like. I can hear it on my iphone, Kindle, laptop and now on my computer at work. It's great to have your favorite music playing in the background while you work. No radio to have to keep up with and find a empty outlet. Pandora you rock and this is from a 63 year old grandmother who loves her music!"

"August 9, 2013","THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM VERY HAPPY WITH PANDORA I WISH I COULD UPGRADE BUT I HAVE NO MONEY KIDS WIFE BACK TO SCHOOL CLOTHES"
"April 25, 2015","Love Pandora."
"August 9, 2013","Works like a charm, no issues with playing. I enjoy the fact it can play in the background while other programs are running"
"December 20, 2012","A pretty solid app, especially if you drop the 36$ for a yearly subscription, it allows continuous play of music based on your input. Like a song or band or genre? Create a station and listen to similar songs you haven't heard yet. Like a song? Thumb it up and the station will play more like that, dislike one and thumb is down and it won't play it again.  It's not as efficient when you selection songs or genres that are unique, but if you like an eclectic selection of music across different genres it works very well."
"January 26, 2013","I love pandora I hook it up to my system and am able to find any kind of music I want. I can place songs I havent heard in 40 years and it will find itl"
"April 5, 2013","Does everything I want. Then again, I don't have a lot of wants. I just start my channel and let it play."

"January 15, 2016","First let me start by saying I think this has been improved from a few years ago because I had it on a previous phone and it did not always work properly. On my latest phone, I have not had any issues whatsoever. I love the fact that a person can create their own stations and I feel that Pandora does a good job of choosing music based upon my likes and dislikes. Pandora is used all the time at my house. I do have the free version, which has occasional ads. However, the ads are few enough that it does not bother me. If ads do annoy a person, then an ad free version of the app can be purchased."
"April 24, 2015","Love this app"
"January 5, 2015","Who doesn't like streaming music!"

"December 19, 2016","Pandora is even better than slice bread. Whoever invented the concept of Pandora I would consider to be a genius. I can listen anywhere that I have Bluetooth or that I can use my auxiliary cord. Absolutely fantastic entertainment for any member of the family because of the various centre of music. Thanks Pandora because you light up my life."
"November 30, 2013","How could anyone NOT love Pandora? I really like that I can select all the music I enjoy and then similar music is added. I can give a thumbs up or down to keep only what I enjoy. The ads are minimal and not irritating. I listen to this when I want to get things done around the house, prepare dinner, or just relaxing. Thank you, Pandora!!!"
"September 8, 2013","Great and easy to see and read. I like using the kindle fire verses my iPhone. The kindle friend is my best purchase."

"May 12, 2015","Love it!"
"October 29, 2015","Wonderful choice of on-line music that allows you to add favorites to your playlist and delete forever songs that you don't like.  This is a wonderful choice for those who do not want to listen to secular music with bad language and adult themes but get tired of listening to Christian radio and limited song choices.  It's free to use and you can customize, see lyrics and select the music you want to hear. It really does not get much better.  We played the Christmas channel while wrapping holiday gifts and it was perfect. They will occasionally plug in a short commercial which is not very intrusive and does not last long or occur too frequently, but for a free service, it is well worth it.  It suggests songs for you based on the ones you have already listened to and you can set playlists that allow you to listen to the BGs and the Beatles on the same play list."
"December 29, 2016","Not enough good things to say about this I love Pandora"

"July 22, 2015","works"
"February 18, 2015","Five star rating for excellence in music. Two things I would recommend though. 1.) Don't put adds on, even if you haven't upgraded to pro yet. This will help us enjoy worshiping the Lord, and having our minds focused on Him. 2. ) I suggest that you have more song selections for an artist, instead of switching to different artists on their radio. For example, if Phil Wickham has more albums out, could his station just play more of those, instead of just one or two? That's my thoughts. Otherwise I would give it a five star rating because of its easy access, availability to access different stations and the superb bookmarks as well. Thanks for your free service Pandora, I will have to say though that your Christian stations are the best! :)"
"November 4, 2013","absolutely the best ever,i get to listen to all the music I love and hear stuff I haven't heard in years"

"September 17, 2014","Love this app! I have a smart tv, so I get it right on my tv, and it's nice when I want to clean or not be distracted by tv shows. It caters to my musical needs, gives me songs that I like. So no need to change the stations, just know that the type of music I like will be played. I plan on making more stations, so that I can listen to a variety of music. The only thing I don't like is that if I want to change stations, I have to exit Pandora and start over. Would be nice if it gave you the option to change stations in the menu."

"January 5, 2015","Always have loved Pandora!"
"February 2, 2014","I honestly just accessed the app store just to write this review. If I could have one downloaded app on my kindle, this would be it. Ever since downloading this, I've even been using it on my laptop.  Pandora basically tells you to tell it what artists you love and plays their songs as well as other similar artists and songs. I've locked in Usher and it's been playing slow Chris Brown and J. Holiday and basically anything that sounds like Usher. It's super easy to use and you even have the choice to give thumbs down to songs you don't like (it'll skip it but you only have a limited amount per hour or so.)  I recommend this for ANY music lover, you won't regret it & it's free."
"August 13, 2013","Good mix of stations that have the genre that you choose. It introduces me to more talented artists and their music."
"December 15, 2014","Absoutely love this station!!!"

"October 16, 2011","Don't judge an app by international licensing laws that don't allow Pandora to stream overseas. I would imagine Pandora would love to stream outside the US. With that said, the app works as advertised."
"January 8, 2015","Good selection of music."
"December 24, 2013","We use Pandora all of the time. I love that I can create a station for my son as well. Thanks"

"December 23, 2014","Fantastic music selections."
"July 26, 2014","I think that Pandora is a great app to have, especially because its free, but also because it allows you to listen to relativley any sort of music. It is a very pleasurable thing to have on your phone, and I very much enjoy it. A few downsides would be that unless you upgrade it, you have constant commercials and advertizments which sometimes block your ability to view the album cover and/ or the song lyrics. Also, you often get a mix of artists on your station, even if you specify a particular artist. So, you may have, for example, a Lady Gaga station but instead of Lady Gaga it constantley plays Ke$ha and Rhiana and Miley Cyrus, which is perfectley fine. It just may take a while to find a Lady Gaga song and it doesnt allow you to press skip very often because you have a dailey skip limit, which virtually most radio apps have, anyway. I enjoy it none the less, and I hope that you will, too!:)"
"November 16, 2014","It's just for trial after that pay"
"August 3, 2013","Now I can take my (3 years of molding) favorites with me. It's all there just like online.Thanks for making it free!"

"December 27, 2012","Pandora is the best way to create your own stations with music you like. Easy to use and create diffent types of stations. Would recommend this app."
"July 15, 2015","Okay, I admit it, I am addicted to Pandora now. Before I got it I didn't understand what the hype was....Why not just listen to the radio? I love how I can tailor the station to the types of music I like and thumbs down the music and songs I don't like. There are also very few commercials, unlike with the radio where you can get 5 minutes worth of commercials at a time. When I get in the car I put on my seat belt, start the car, and set up Pandora through Bluetooth. It has become part of my driving routine. I also connect it to a stereo so I can listen while cleaning, doing yard work, or swimming in the pool."
"July 14, 2013","I love the fact that I can customize my own radio stations on Pandora! And that they can change with my mood. Thank you"
"March 1, 2013","way too many ads. Bookmarking is useless. when you bookmark a song you then only get a few seconds of the song when you go back to it."

"November 30, 2014","love it love it love it love it"
"September 20, 2013","It's very easy to get in a musical rut, playing the same album, playlist or group over and over. Pandora combats this. What first seems a shortcoming, limiting the number of songs from a given artist it can play in a time period, is actually it's best feature. Pandora does a good job of selecting other music similar to your original criteria. What's really amazing is, as you give more feedback about what you like and don't like, it does an uncanny job of selecting tunes that appeal to your taste. I know Pandora advertises this proprietary feature up front but I'm really amazed at how well it works. On the down side, the Windows interface is great, clean and user friendly, but I find the Android version on my phone a challenge. Part of the problem is my big fingers, poor eyesight and penchant for bright sunshine. Still, I think they should take that into account in a mobile app."
"June 30, 2013","Love it, love it, love it, love it love it. did I say that I love it? Lol. Its a lot of fun at the gym while doing cardio"

"February 4, 2016","Personally I do not like Pandora it doesn't have enough songs I like. I listen to EDM and their selection is quite limited. I used to use an online station called shoutcast and it was awesome, completely free and no advertisements. Pandora follows the free to play model where you get a decent taste with the free version but frustrating enough that your basically forced to get the paid version."

"September 13, 2014","I've been on Pandora for years and love it."
"February 22, 2016","It is a great app. You get to listen to a variety of music and it's free. But it is really frustrating how often it reopens after just pausing it. I often pause because we like the song and something is making it hard to hear and then there is no way to get back to it. It also happens when it disconnects from a blue tooth device. It doesn't just go back to playing from the phone it closes."
"September 18, 2014","I like pandora thanks for tha musical 👍👍"

Recently, Pandora stopped working altogether on my phone, whether I was connected to my home Wi-Fi, the gym's, or no Wi-Fi at all (making me use data). I would turn on the app, and my phone screen would go black. Had to turn the phone off and back on again to get my home screen. So I uninstalled Pandora, and then reinstalled it. Now it is working; let's see for how long."

"May 24, 2013","I recently downloaded this app thought it was awesome at first and then it said I had to start paying because I went over the amount of hours. So I was pretty upset about that cause I really like Pandora but I guess I can still use it on a regular computer. Honestly I think a great app for a kindle fire or any tablet would be Iheartradio because its free,you never have to pay and it's somewhat similar to what Pandora gives you and also you can listen to your favorite radio stations. But overall Pandora is an awesome app it just sucks it's not always going to be free."

"December 16, 2014","A fantastic media service I cannot praise enough. Enter into the cue a favorite song and all proceeding songs will be similar. If a song appears that one does not care for, one can tell Pandora so and it will accommodate. For any lover of music it is an indispensable service that will probably introduce songs to one's liking that they were not originally aware of."

"March 16, 2014","Pandora worked out of the box, but I found the instructions to be unclear. Example, when I accidently bypassed the correct 'time' setting, it took me 2 days and hours of internet research to find how to reset. Seems to me there should be an instruction booklet with the unit. It is different that the computer I've used for years, and trying to use the on-line guide is a bit cumbersome. It does seem to work well when I can figure something out, however."

"January 12, 2015","a+"
"July 31, 2014","still learning how great this is!"
"July 5, 2016","Works exactly like the PC version. In fact, this app does pick up your PC playlists. Very clear sound. If you have not used Pandora before, you will love the music, because you set the playlist name. As an example, some of my lists are named ""Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Connie Francis"". When you set this playlist, not all of the songs are by the artist listed. On the Frank Sinatra list, I get Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, and many more. On many days, I will switch between lists, depending on my mood. This app is well worth downloading."
"March 24, 2013","Pandora is great. Sure I could do without the ads, but for free it gives great music and so many station choices."

"August 17, 2016","This is a music app for a cell phone. I, and friends like it a lot. I open it while at the computer, turn the music down low and am comforted while doing whatever on the computer. Learned the ""hard way"" Pandora uses cell phone data. Some kind soul advised me to connect to my in home wifi and I would not incur data overage. One is able to set up their favorite music, Gospel, 60s, 70s, etc. and choose according to their mood which to listen to. I am probably preaching to the choir. A nice feature is Pandora is a free app.  I am told it can be connected to one's computer. Haven't tried this yet."

"July 9, 2015","I've been using Pandora for quite sometime. I love being able to customize my stations with the music and bands I want to hear. If I could change one little thing it is to automatically remove Holiday music from my station after the holiday is over. Otherwise it continues to play and I have to thumb it down and add it back manually later. I think it is really easy to use. Some songs will even have lyrics available which is nice if I feel the need to sing along and don't know it well."

This is the 3rd app that I have downloaded and it failed to say why. It opens even but totally unusable. I have been wanting Pandora back for like forever. It would really be a cool thing to do if you opened the app store and it have an option that you could click on that you were either an Android user or a BlackBerry user. I've only downloaded 3 apps and had to just delete thm. A little help Amazon."

"November 29, 2014","While visiting my oldest daughter I had to ask what radio station she was listening to and learned about Pandora. So then I invited my youngest daughter to come and load my Kindle Fire with my kinds of music and have been enjoying it ever since. As I read at night (with enlarged print and good lighting on the Kindle Fire) I now listen to wonderful background music set to the timer so I can read, fall asleep etc. without listening to the 11:00 news and getting upset with the mess the world is in. I now ""waltz off to sleep"" with my Kindle Fire loaded with Pandora music. Thank you so much."

"September 26, 2014","The best so far."
"November 23, 2015","Not bad but I prefer Spotify. The main issue with Pandora is that if you are trying to listen to music of a certain genre, it keeps playing old stuff, like 5-6 and more years old stuff. If you just want music like a certain artist you might be luckier."
"February 4, 2013","I can put the Kindle in the kitchen when my wife is cooking, or I can carry it around when I'm cleaning! Awesome!"

"November 25, 2014","GOOD"
"January 31, 2013","I like the idea that Pandora will try to find music that you like but...so far I don't think it's very good at it."
"November 9, 2014","love it"
"November 26, 2012","The only thing that would make it better would be to actually pick songs you want to hear. It does repeat songs sometimes."

"April 25, 2013","Pandora has the type of music I like to listen to. I love the different type of genre Pandora offers."
"July 26, 2016","I like Pandora better than others, I had premium service. Unfortunately I got annoyed by the inability to skip as many songs I want when I want it. So I had canceled the service."
"January 29, 2013","Chose because already have account on computer. Enjoy the ease of use and ability to listen to my choices anytime."
"October 15, 2015","A good free program except for the commercials. I realize that they are necessay and that there is a Pandora One program tha is commercial free, however, it would be nice if the would tell you the cost of the program before a person signs up for the trial period. I am always concerned when I sign up for something not knowing what the ultimate cost will be if you deicde to keep the program."
"March 21, 2013","I just put on Pandora and let the music go without a DJ to talk. I also like sharing stations with friends."
"July 18, 2014","Luv this app I get any music"
"May 18, 2014","I like Pandora. When I paid for a subscription I listened to my favorite styles of music on my android tablet, my Kindle Fire and my pc. When I switched to the free account, I could still listen on everything but my Kindle Fire. This app keeps telling me I've ""timed out"", even though I haven't listened to it for days. The last straw came when my KF notified me that Pandora had automatically been updated. I clicked on the app and was told I was timed out of a version I haven't even used! Some apps never stop running. This seems to be one of them. I thought it might help if I logged out instead of telling it to quit, but I couldn't get in to do that. If you want to pay for a subscription, you won't have this problem. But at least for now I'm through with this app that counts itself as running when it isn't being used."
"August 27, 2015","This is a great great app! I actually found some people I never even heard of, like Jasmine Thompson, Avril Levigne, and (ikr) Meghan Trainor. They are now some of my favorite singers. The only problem are the ads. They aren't super bad, it's just that they happen at all. It's just a commercial off and on, or ""tap the banner below to go to blah blah blah "". My advice : just don't skip every single song. It makes more commercials! Also, when you skip, you eventually use up all your skips for an hour. Other than that, it's a great app!"
"November 8, 2014","Perfect"
"July 29, 2014","Great product and service."
"December 1, 2012","I love that I put in one artist & you know who else I want to hear. I am a big rock & roll fan & you play all my favorites"
"January 14, 2013","So much to choose from and will never get tired of the same music over and over. I would recommend this to everyone."
"May 1, 2013","I like that the sound quality is very good. I'm hoping I'll be able to receive it during my vacation."
"October 28, 2014","Great!!!!"
"March 20, 2013","Very Good, I am glad that I choose this from Amazon. I would definitely order from here again. Thank You."
"December 15, 2012","This seems like a really good music app. I am still learning & getting used to it & am looking forward to learning more."
"January 14, 2013","Love that I can choose what to listen to and play it when I want. Wish I'd found it sooner! Highly recommended."
"December 23, 2012","I have this app on my Iphone and I really like it. I like the fact that i can listen to any kind of music at any time."

It would just shut down, I don't know why and its making me angry. Someone tell me why it isn't working! I have to keep downloading it over and over again and its getting annoying."
"February 18, 2013","I love this app because I can listen to the radio anywhere I go and I haven't run into any glitches yet."

"February 8, 2013","Its ok, love the selection but don't like that I have to purchase a different app to prevent the pop ups."
"January 10, 2013","It's cheap and ez to have the exact type of music selection you want anytime you want it. What's not to love?"
"October 15, 2014","Cool"

"August 10, 2014","LOVE THIS APP.!!"
"February 12, 2013","It does not pull up the artist sometimes and it definately does not pull up the songs I am looking for."
"October 8, 2012","Pandora is an appropriate name for this - you have no idea where it will take you, but the journey is always interesting!"
"January 6, 2013","Great little app for listening to your music, Works well on my android device and is well worth getting now."

"November 29, 2012","This is a great app. I listen to it all day while at work being I no longer have a stereo there. Great selections!"
"January 20, 2016","Paying for Pandora is hands down the best investment I made. The Only thing I really dislike is when it stops playing music and says it doesn't want to play to an empty room. If anyone knows a way around that, please let me know. I want to leave it on all night but it stops playing."
"September 26, 2014","Love it"
"December 14, 2016","Great for a free app. I wish there were more ways to extrapolate lesser known artists as opposed to only the obviously famous ones. I feel like I spend more time fast forwarding through songs (which you're only allowed to do so many times before a commercial break) than I am listening to actual music. I also have a problem with how some of the genres populate their songs, artists, etc. I disagree with how a lot of the music winds up getting categorized."
"August 8, 2014","LOVED ITLOVED IT"
"November 28, 2012","I truely enjoy this music app. It does have some ads, but it is still better than radio. I truely enjoy Pandora!"

"October 4, 2014","Great"
"January 17, 2013","I love Pandora. Being able to set up your own ""personal radio station"" that only plays the songs and music you love is one of the greatest ideas ever!"
"October 25, 2013","I love Pandora, and this app is no exception. It is great to be able to just log in and have a personalized radio. It also exposes you to different music that you would have never thought of listening to. However, that's only when it works. Unfortunately, this app very rarely functions properly on my Kindle Fire HD. It often freezes up, and refuses to do anything except close, and it is also prone to just completely not opening. It is ridiculously annoying. But still, it is a great app, when it works."
"September 13, 2014","enjoyable"
"January 9, 2013","i love their music and cutom made radio stations with ease of operation. from rock and roll to classic music"

"March 2, 2013","my daughter loves to be able to listen to her music while she is playing her games or drawing great"
"January 2, 2013","It is so great that I have control of what songs I listen to, and there are so many options to choose from."
"September 19, 2014","Great."
"December 2, 2015","Can only speak to the ""free"" version. Frankly, at the price (free), it is not even close to a bargain. Whatever parameters they use in selecting the music for your personalized ""stations"" are so far off it is ludicrous. No idea what you get when you pony up their fee, but I sure hope it is an upgrade. There are other, better options out there in my opinion. It was recommended by numerous people, so it must just be me, but I deleted it less than a day after I downloaded it."
"July 15, 2014","Not able to access"
"June 28, 2014","Use it all their time"

"March 17, 2013","I love it cuz I have this dream to be a singer and so I love Pandora so much 5 stars"
"April 4, 2014","The free version has a ridiculous amount of commercials. Initially it wasn't too bad, but the more Pandora was played, the more commercials were played. Also, many of the the pop up ads have an adult theme to them, so beware of the commercial/ad content. I'm sure their idea is to breakdown the user by having so many commercials that they'll download the app with the monthly fee. Boo! :("
"September 20, 2014","Great"
"July 22, 2014","Great listening!"
"January 10, 2013","Does what it does and well. Listen to music at your own comfort and see if you like anything it suggests."

They have never timed me and if it keeps on doing this then I will download I heart radio or some other free app. Please you guys are becoming cheap just because you decided to upgrade doesn't mean that a minor will pay you just cause you wanted to upgrade your stuff the other version was just dine to me. I love Pandora it is the app that I use absolutely everyday I don't want to have to delete it."

"November 18, 2012","It's a music app. What can I say? Speaks for itself. Make your own channel & listen to what you like."
"January 31, 2013","It lets you pick a genre and you are able to listen to all styles of music wherever you go."
"January 21, 2016","I love this and use it everyday. I thinks it's better than any other music app. There are so many ready made stations, that all you have to do it chose a band or style that you like and it will play it for you. But it gets even better because you can personalize it to your individual taste"

"January 1, 2013","just hooked it up today. so far so good price was right can't think of a hole lot more to say"
"June 26, 2013","I've been a Pandora subscriber for about 2 years. For me, it's well worth paying for and it's taken the place of our defunct stereo system. I don't use is as yet another social network; I just listen to music. I would prefer having an option to listen to ONLY a particular person or group. Being ""introduced"" to other similar artists is fine a lot of the time but there are times when I want to listen to only who I want to listen to. The only downside is that if the Internet goes down, so does the music. Overall, I'm pleased with Pandora and listen to it for much of the day, most days. I plan to continue my subscription indefinitely ~~ unless they change something drastically in a way that doesn't work for me. So far, It's a perfect solution for me."
"July 3, 2014","Love it"
"July 3, 2014","Like it"
"October 18, 2011","its finally for android, this app is just awesome, nothing less to say. works great, sounds great, and for some reason, it plays music I like : )"
"December 1, 2015","Pandora works great on everything except my new amazon fire tablets. I bought 2 tablets and neither have sound when running Pandora. It's the only program that does not work. Amazon fire only. Program runs, shows a song is playing, progression bar does not move, no sound on tablet. 1 star only for fire tablet. 5 stars on any other device."

"August 25, 2015","needed a source of background music in my living room....not very adept at it but easy to set up. Will stop and ask if I'm still listening and occasionally run an advertisement and seems to make assumptions about the type of music I want, but seldom runs anything I don't like."
"December 10, 2012","We don't really use this, but I am sure some day we will. It'll be useful! I recommend it still!"

"March 27, 2016","My Pandora app has been glitching ever since that message started popping up about a week or 2 or 3 ago (i don't remember exactly when) So I've uninstalled and then redownloaded the app at least 4 times from Google play and twice now from Amazon app store and the message still keeps popping up when I try to use the app. I'm not buying it but I will use the free version in the app stores. So why does it say I don't own it and therefore can't use it [glitch free]?"

"June 28, 2014","Love!"
"August 27, 2014","Love it"
"September 1, 2016","Aweful! Worked well at first but it seems the service just gets more annoying the longer you go without upgrading. I can barely get one song to play with out it freezing up, and it not a speed or equipment issue as it does the same thing on several devices and at any speed."
"November 30, 2014","Love it. I don't mind ONE commercial here and There. My only comment is that once in a while you have to uninstall and re install from device or devises even wen you have it regularly updated still tilts from time to time like twice a year. No biggie since it's free and great app."
"February 11, 2016","When I try to play a song it only plays like 0.001% of a second of it then it skips to the end and freezes. I really love Nightcore and Meghan Trainor Radio but I can't listen to it with all of this happening. 😩😩😩😩😩. Please fix it and I will raise my rating. Thank you!"
"November 3, 2012","Its a great song app. Love the fact I can choose a station to listen to and its a great selection."
"November 2, 2012","I like I heart radio better, but this one is similar to the same! :) You :) are getting a good app"
"December 17, 2012","I don't think there is a single person now a days who has not used this app. It works great."
"December 9, 2012","I love this product. I have it on m home computer, my iPhone, my iPad and my Kindle. Love it."
"July 18, 2013","I use Pandora often on my computer, so I was excited to get it on my Kindle Fire HD and my daughters' tablets. While it works fine on the Android tablets, Pandora is a nightmare on the Kindle Fire. It takes forever to load (and usually multiple tries); it often stops playing for no apparent reason in the middle of songs, and may or may not resume at any given moment; and even if it does play well, when I try to turn Pandora off it won't shut off. I have to completely shut off the Kindle to get it to quit.  Hopefully Pandora will soon fix this mess so I can enjoy music on my Kindle Fire. Two stars because it does, in fact, work on other tablets. DO NOT get the app if you have a Kindle."
"November 14, 2016","If you like your music everywhere you go without taking up your memory or carrying extra music devices, then Pandora is the way to go!"
"January 7, 2013","I have always loved pandora and I use this app on all my products that I own in my house"
"November 20, 2012","I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire. I can now listen to whatever music I am in the mood for when I am on my Kindle. Even better, it was a free app! Very easy to download, just took seconds."
"November 25, 2012","It is the best way to get all the music I like. I play it all the time. It very easy to use."
"December 9, 2012","I listen to all the time and its like having your very own DJ. I am very pleased with it!"
"August 6, 2015","Have been listening to Pandora for years. I love that I can plug in a 'vibe' I want and get all kinds of music I've never heard of. Have used it for Halloween parties, holiday get-togethers, and my go-to station for work is one of my favorite motion picture score composers. I use Pandora as a way to find other similar artists - this works especially well in classical music. I don't mind the ads - a lot of times I get value from those, too, because the ads are for local deals and specials. Love that I can listen to Pandora on my Kindle while reading, I can access it on my iPad while working out, and I can bluetooth-stream it through my car. I'm always just a click away from my favorite music!"
"March 18, 2015","Pandora is great until I search a Relaxing & Sleep sounds and upon falling asleep, I was startled by an Advertisement announcement. Well it took another hour to fall back asleep. I found that to be Add Free, Pandora will accept a MONTHLY FEE of $4.55 not a small one time FEE. So no more sleep sounds. But Pandora is nice and ok, but I rather use my Kindle Fire and IPhone for my Music Videos. Oh forgot to say, you have commercial adds even when your Pandora music files, just walk away and you will not see any ads."
"November 2, 2016","I have only used it for a few days but it seems realy neat. I can just pick an artist type the name and teh musci from taht artist plays. Pretty cool!"
"May 2, 2016","So, I got this app and signed up. After I entered my info, it wouldn't let me sign up! I tried new passwords, but to no avail! What exactly could be the problem? I am familiar with Pandora and I think it's an awesome app, so I'm giving it a four star rating because it's awesome, but won't let me sign up!"
"June 12, 2017","I've moved back to pandora from Spotify due to increased music selection. could and probably will get better"
"July 23, 2014","great"
"February 2, 2013","this app is great and so is the quility of it . there is a lot of stuff advable ."
"December 9, 2012","Tried it but had too many ads. Skip a song or two and more ads come. Removed in a day."
"December 16, 2012","I like the feeling that I know I have music at my finger tips when and where I want it."
"December 21, 2012","When i listen to it, it is ok. Don't use it often. This site is new to me and it is ok"
"December 26, 2013","I heard Pandora playing at someone's house several weeks ago. I decided to sign up for the free version to see what it was like. They do have ads however they are few and far between. There is no comparison to regular radio which bombard you with so many commercials it seems that there are more of them than there is music. With Pandora you can also choose your favorite genres. Most radio stations have a theme but Pandora is much better I think. I will never listen to radio again if Pandora is available."
"December 26, 2012","My music when i want it and i dont have to download it, what can be better. I love it"
"December 12, 2015","It won't play the songs. Everything else works, thumbs up, thumbs down, skip, but it won't load the songs at all.😒"
"November 19, 2011","Pandora is the perfect radio station. Having it on your phone is even better. And the price was perfect! Get it for your Android."
"January 16, 2013","A friend of mine had this app on her phone and I didn't even know what it was. I thought it was awesome and downloaded it onto my kindle. Very neat and easily able to be customized."
"July 10, 2014","love this"
"November 28, 2012","I use it all the time for every music mood. Plus i can listen to all sorts of comedy too"
"May 6, 2014","Awesome"
"December 25, 2012","Great App ! A Must Have App ! If you have only one App this is it ! Thanks Pandora!"
"November 15, 2016","wonderful"
"February 14, 2012","It seems the phone app seems to drop songs quite often, not sure if this a Pandora issue or phone, otherwise it's alright."
"August 4, 2016","At first I loved this and still love parts of it. The issue that I have with it is that when I listen to a Station that I have.They are supposed to play music similar the the title of the station I am listening to.... it tends to play music that has nothing to do with the station that I am listening to. For example. I have one called ""Loretta Lynn Radio"" She is classic country music .. I have female singers from that era on there... Like Patsy Cline,Kitty Wells,etc.... SO now some one tell me what Michael Jackson's Thriller have to do with country music. ?? That is one of the songs that they played on the Loretta Lynn Station."
"September 6, 2012","A must have for anyone that loves music, or for any one who likes to make the time past better."
"January 10, 2013","I love the fact you can make your own station. It plays the songs you like. It goes with you."
"December 12, 2011","I have no idea what others are complaining about. I have pro subscription so I don't get ads, but runs great on all my devices."
"November 13, 2013","I saw that a sleep timer had been added, but with the new update it is gone again. What happened? The only reason I put this app on my kindle was so I could fall asleep to relaxing music."
"February 6, 2015","I got this app for my Kindle and Android phone and now I have music everywhere I go. It's much better than radio. ""Reception"" is crystal clear and it has less (a lot less!) commercials than radio. Commercial interruptions are tolerable and the content of the commercials are even relevant sometimes. And if you're willing pay a monthly subscription fee (currently 4.99, up from 3.00 when it was introduced in 2009), you get advertising-free music. Last, I shouldn't forget to mention that if you have T-Mobile (I do), music streaming on Pandora doesn't count towards your data usage. SWEEEET!"
"May 6, 2014","Love it!"
"May 15, 2016","Pandora is a great music service. Free version of App has minimal commercials. Primarily interruption free listening. Create account, preferences, get recommended music. Account accessible from any device. Listen anywhere. Definitely would download again."
"April 12, 2014","The obvious good is that I get to choose which songs I want and I can create several different stations for different types of music. The part I don't like is that it seems to want me to continuously interact with it to tell it what I like and don't like. It also tests my patience by throwing in songs that I do not want. I don't want a radio station that I have to babysit. I prefer music to just ""be on"" in the background. The best time to set up a Pandora account is on a long car trip, so that I had several hours to fine-tune my stations."
"November 19, 2012","Just a great free app for music on my global two Android. Good music at a great price. That's plenty."
"November 29, 2014","I find the loop of music too short. I only received my Kindle about 2 weeks ago and am already getting lots of repeat songs, which shouldn't be happening so soon with all the zillions of songs out there. Also, when I click on the Beatles station, I get a lot of music before Beatles music happens. Yes, I'm on shuffle, but I thought when I was on a station, I'd hear at least a lot of that music. But the short loop is my primary dissatisfaction. I haven't updated to the no-advertisement membership because I don't mind them. I thought perhaps if I did upgrade, I'd get a longer time between repeat songs, but that's not what no-ads means, so I'm not sure that would solve the problem."
"January 11, 2012","the best stream radio i wanted one song i love but instead it not only gave me that song/artistubut many more just like it"
"October 24, 2011","I can't stop using this app. Very enjoyable. No problems so far. Who doesn't like having music of their choice anytime, anywhere?"
"September 16, 2016","Love every purpose intended.... but like when I run out of skips it happens to stations I have listened to in days. And a few times every time I skip it sometimes plays the same song back to back three times in a row. Other than the stupid, small flaws.... I love it"
"January 21, 2012","why is everyone crying about free music???? this app is awesome Works great plays exactly what I want to hear every time."
"February 2, 2017","it keeps coming on when I'm doing something else on another menu. I can't get rid of it unless I completely close down my device."
"April 14, 2013","Pandora is the best app (or internet site) out there. Your music, all the time with only a few short ads every 10 songs or so (they have to make money some how). I am a child of the 70's so my Eagles Radio gives me all the classic rock I could ever want. The pre-programmed stations are great too. Gotta love a little disco from time to time on 70's radio. And sometimes I even like a little country. Listen at home on the internet, on your smart phone, tablet.. and of course Kindle. Wifi or 3 or 4 G. Make your own station based on any of your favorite bands. The more music you ""like"" the more customized it becomes. thumbs down and you never hear it again."
"June 23, 2016","love it"
"January 25, 2013","It plays well but I feel limited in how it plays. The screen is clear but not easy to use."
"April 20, 2014","okay"
"January 2, 2014","I love Pandora but lately it's been refreshing in the middle of a song and starts a new one. It also just shuts down if you are on silk for more than couple of minutes. Like maybe two songs at most. I know that if you don't like a song for a while it will as you if you are still listening but it's not like that. It will just shut down completely. I like listing to Pandora while I'm browsing the Internet on silk but now I can't. Please fix"
"February 13, 2015","I find that when you create a radio station that the same songs play over and over again. In my case I created several 'radio stations' based on performers such as Simon & Garfunkel. I know S & G have recorded many songs but only heard three or four of them along with a lot of other performers music that was of only marginal interest to me. If you skip too many songs - you get a message that is not allowed as often as you like.  I also found over the two months I tried using it that most of the music was from albums recorded at 'live' events, I prefer the higher quality studio songs - I don't seem to have any choice in the issue. No longer using Pandora."
"February 16, 2015","It's free! With adverts. And you have to create a Pandora account or sign in with an existing one. :P And you can only use it while connected to the internet, which makes sense, but is a bit of a bummer. No airplane mode with this one! It took me a little time to figure out how to navigate, but it's fairly simple, so I think I've got the basics down. The best part is that you can run this in the background while you do other things on your Kindle; I like to listen as I read, especially since I haven't gotten my own music onto my Fire yet. I think it's best suited for people already familiar with Pandora, but I recommend it for anyone who's online and wants some music!"
"January 13, 2013","I like I hart radio better. I have only listened to it once. . . . . . . ."
"May 8, 2012","Ok so I discovered Pandora and fell in love with it. I like that I can change and create my own stations."
"January 12, 2013","it is not that good but it a app what can u do lol so get it or dont haha"
"January 4, 2013","Works great, easy download and streams well.... .. . . . . . . . . . . . ."
"April 2, 2014","Put this on my Kindle and also my computer as I really enjoy listening to music. When you enter an artist, you get a mix of that artist along with similar artists. You can put in multiple artists and put the music on shuffle and it will go back and forth between artists/genres. Although not significant, I have found that the information/lyrics are sometimes incorrect. For example, I can't remember who they said wrote the song OHIO, but it was not the correct artist-it was written by Neil Young. Not generally a big deal or problem. I have opted to not pay the 3.99/mo to get Pandora commercial free as they are all less than 30 seconds and for me are not bothersome."
"March 17, 2012","its ok but needs better options for phone. your music genre is next to none. volume control would be awesome."
"January 23, 2013","I would recommend this to anyone that I know that has Kindle. I was surprised at the quality of music on my Kindle."
"February 4, 2012","best app i downloaded for my tablet. if you want to listen to music when ever you want i HIGHLY RECOMEND this app"
"September 28, 2016","I like the fact I'm able to pick the songs i like"
"June 26, 2015","I absolutely love Pandora! I choose to add the monthly subscription (it's like $3.99 a month) and the subscription is totally worth it. Regular Pandora has occasional ads that you can't skip but with the subscription there are no ads. I use this app every day, I have all my favorite stations trained to play my favorite songs all the time. I have even found new artists and songs I didn't know existed as Pandora will occasionally add a random new song or artist into the mix."
"September 25, 2016","My account shows that I have this app, but I don't - Every time I click on it, it says my 'session has timed out' (although I just tried opening it) and other times it says that 'an account cannot be set up for me at this time' (or words to that effect)."
"November 8, 2015","I have a complaint. . . My Elvis Presley channel plays one to two of Elvis songs in a hour. I hear more Waylon and Johnnie cash than Elvis. The same goes for all the other channels I set. Why set up your favorite artists when you play what you want?"
"May 24, 2014","Another ap that won't open just goes back to home screen of the kindle. Very annoying. (But hey that's what my droid and iPod are for.....right?)"
"March 10, 2015","Pandora used to have a nice interface. Now it spams you with alarm notifications and ads that must be manually closed. You have to go through 3 screens just to close the program. It doesn't support the menu button. It turns on and off randomly, so you can't let it idle in the background. Perfect, now after I have been bluetooth streaming in the car, leave the car and let the app shut itself down, it will wake up on a whim at a random time and blare music. When I'm in a meeting or library. Awesome.... Fix your app, Pandora. There is no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance. I know that I would never pay for premium these issues."
"May 16, 2016","I love the app but one problem: the comment section. People keep leaving chain mail for example, say this kiss your hand post this on other songs in minutes and you will have good luck and people are swearing and giving out personal information. And I keep saying, "" do not give out personal information like that you never know what will happen."". And people are just being inappropriate. So, either take down the comment section or make sure to be super strict like on Moviestar Planet."
"February 20, 2015","Too many ads"
"September 6, 2013","I use al the time instead of playing my radio at home and in the car. This app is a must have."
"November 22, 2011","why all of a sudden it only play 1 minute of every song but plays complete commercials??????? Get this fixed ASAP!!!"
"September 4, 2016","Love this! However, too many and too long pauses. Guess I'm having trouble with streaming. I'm not tech savvy, so I'm at a loss as to what the problem is or what to do to remedy it."
"February 24, 2012","Got the droid x update and now it doesn't shut down on me anymore! Love it! Works better than slacker imo"
"December 30, 2013","My neighbor helped me sign-up on Pandora. We were able to listen to great, instrumental Christmas music. Now I can listen to many different varieties of music that my wife and I enjoy. Mostly easy-listening. I have a wireless speaker that I can take to any room I want and the music is right there. What a treat. No more crap radio."
"June 24, 2015","I give this a 5 star rating because I am really stuck to music, and it is free!!! I can create new stations. But the big deal is adds. Every song I play, I leave my fire on my bed and listen to an add, and another one comes on. UUUUURRRRRGGGGG!!!!! So I almost put a 4 star rating.😞😠. But my 💜 (heart) told me not to. So I didn't. I told my mom last night I wish that there were NO adds in the world. But I have really great station's like Dove Camron or Ariana Grande."
"November 14, 2016","I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I sometimes hear the same songs over and over again - in the same order. It's getting a little aggravating, because even though I like those songs, I don't want to hear the same ones in the same order every time I listen to a station. I've only noticed it happening on the Pop Rock radio I have, thankfully. Pandora often offers me a new song when I first click on the station, but it's usually a song I don't like (and I'm not holding that against them, of course). So I'll put a thumbs down. But then I get the same songs all over again. It's quite frustrating."
"September 3, 2015","Worked great for 4 months, but now will not play at all! This is the second phone (HTC ONE M9) that this has happened to. The other phone was a Galaxy S4, the situation could never be resolved on that phone either. I have been a paying subscriber for a long time now, but that ends today. Too many people have the same problem as I do and Pandora's solution does not work. I hate to say goodbye to Pandora but I don't feel that I have any choice. Thank you."
"July 18, 2016","I have been using Pandora for years now and I absolutely adore the service! I must have 15 custom-created stations on it . Not only do i enjoy music I know but it also gives me the opportunity to hear new music and artists I have never heard before."
"April 6, 2016","This app would place the picture of the letter p in my photo gallery in several different spots and I would remove them and it would do it again so I removed it from my phone."
"July 6, 2017","I am 10 and I have no idea what a zip code is! I can't sign in! I thought you just get to hear music, but no! I uninstalled because I don't want to go though all this stuff... Darn it :("
"October 4, 2016","Good music app. You are able to create a profile and start listening right away without having to download each song. You are able to pick an artist or genre and it gives you a variety of music. You can pick anything from smooth jazz to lil wayne. There a few short ads that pop up in between songs. You are able to skip I think 5 or 6 at a time if you don't want to hear it at the moment. This app learns your tastes and will suggest songs or remove ones you didn't like from your playlist. I like that you can even listen to comedy skits or holiday music. If you are looking for a good music app this is it."
"May 10, 2016","I think the sound quality and volume varies a lot from song to song. Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in my car for a while. I thought it was great! But for the $15 / mo. that they wanted for a subscription, they didn't have enough stations I wanted to make it worth while. I play cd's a lot because of sound quality and level. My wife only uses her Pandora once in a while."
"June 4, 2016","Took it off my tablet almost as soon as I put it on. Not a huge fan of Pandora and didn't like the way the app worked."
"August 2, 2015","Pandora app works as intended, however having a video add literally every 2-3 songs is a bit excessive. I loved how there was a programming bug at one point of time that caused AD interruptions, however seems like that has been since fixed. The only other thing I can think of is how it recommends like artists for your playlist. Very redundant on songs, little variety. Some recommendations are complete outside the genre that you are listening to. Songs that I have downvoted still play, it is a very broken system. If Grooveshark wouldn't have been shut down, I would definitely not be using Pandora. Needs improvement for sure."
"May 8, 2014","I was reading the reviews while Pandora got downloaded on my kindle, then I open it, and... It didn't work on Peru. Yes, I am in Peru and I talk English pretty well, and I am American. Yeah, confusing. But the point is that it doesn't work everywhere. It just works in the US. Bam, they got me. I usually give good reviews, but I couldn't even use it, so, what's the point? Thanks, and put useful to this review, please. Oh, I think you'd like hotspot fm. Look for I, it's free. Thanks"
"October 29, 2016","Love this app. I can listen to all my favorite artists and it selects music according to what I have listened to. Only downside is you can only skip 5 songs at a time and then you have to listen to what they have chosed."
"November 14, 2016","I love this app, and will continue to use it even with the other apps out there. Pandora will forever be my favorite one. I wish it was free from ads, but I guess that is why you have the option to buy it without ads"
"June 3, 2013","This app is awesome. So can make your own playlists by your favorite singers or songs. And most of the songs allow you to look at the lyrics for that song. Another reason why this app is awesome is because you can listen to songs for hours and they never pay the same songs over and over again. You can also taste the songs if they are playing a song that u dont like then u can hit the thumb down button and it will never pay that song on that playlist again. This app is great. I highly recommend this app. The only bad thing is you only get six skips per hour on each playlist. But when your listening to Pandora time flies by!"
"July 30, 2015","Pandora makes it super easy to assemble music of the same genre. I have created a lot of radio stations, but when I made a station from one particularly relaxing track (by David and Steve Gordon), Pandora found more music like it than I ever expected to find. I love discovering new titles and learning about the artists. This station is like being at a spa every time I hear the selection of music that Pandora plays. I hope Pandora will always be around."
"March 5, 2012","Great i love it you can mix your music to the way you like it and its all free.Did i say free."
"February 4, 2016","I love Pandora!!! It gives me the choice of what I want to listen to without pushing buttons to find that one station. If I want to change it, it can be done just for me.  My preference is SMOOTH JAZZ it gives peace of mind and I can meditate, relax, after work or cleaning house on a Saturday morning.  Even when I have a bad day SMOOTH JAZZ is the way to go. Variety with PANDORA is the way to go......  A+++++++"
"March 24, 2017","I rated this app 5 stars because of how im able to personalize my stations and how wide the variety of music is I LOVE PANDORA!!!!"
"November 6, 2016","How can you not love Pandora? Whatever music you want, when you want it."
"November 11, 2017","I really loved Pandorea until today when I opened it and it was a totally different format. This format allows annoying ads to be on top of the song information where before ads were in the corner. My grandmas old phone had this format about ten years ago! I do not like the format and think it is harder to use. Please change it back!"
"January 18, 2013","It is a great way to hear your favorite music when using your Kindle for another app. I also like the fact I can listen wherever I can use my Kindle."
"January 23, 2014","I would give it 5 stars, if, when searching for a song, or creating a station based on a song, that song is played first, so I know I've chosed the right song/artist. Another reason for the less than perfect rating is the commericals. I understand the need for them, but not more than once every 3 songs. And not the same commercial every other time. I just shut it off and switch back to regular radio at that point. The final issue is buffering. Mine does that a lot, right in the middle of the song sometimes."
"May 9, 2014","My wife and I chose this app. after we purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The variety of music with Pandora is the best we have ever heard. Many of the album cuts by the artists you choose and others are cuts we have never heard and it's always a pleasure to hear a song by a favorite artist for the first time. Their may be other apps out there that are similar to Pandora and maybe better but my wife and I aren't looking. We are permanent Pandora listeners. It also works well with our TV's through Roku and Smart TV's. We highly recommend Pandora for all music lovers and the variety it brings to your life."
"December 6, 2013","nice"
"March 5, 2016","I purchased the Pandora One subscription. There are several things I enjoy about Pandora. I have been able to check my favorites list when I wanted to check out a song I've heard for the first time I liked. Being able to give a song a thumbs up or down helps control which songs I want on rotation too. You can use the free Pandora with all the same features too. The only difference is the free version contains ads."
"June 30, 2016","GET THIS GAME U CAN LISTEN TO ALL YOUR SONGS AND U CAN SEARCH THEM TOO PLUS U CAN PUT THUMPS UP OR DOWN BUT I LOVE THIS APP IF I WERE U I WOULD GET THIS APP!! :)P.S.

"October 12, 2017","for my life span, all the tunes I've listened to, Pandora is awesome!"
"January 29, 2016","My pandora wouldn't upload correctly so when I deleted it to try and reinstall, it erased from my apps but still said I had it in my appstore which is completely false! Everytime I hit ""uninstall"" on my amazon appstore the appstore completely closes. Very dissapointed"
"March 1, 2015","Pandora is one of the greatest inventions to come from the internet. Thank you to the creator! I love being able to put on music customized to my specific likes and moods. This is a must have for everyone. Who doesn't like music?! The commercials every so often are annoying but I'm too cheap to purchase ad free listening."
"July 16, 2016","I've been a Pandora subscriber for years and only recently added this app to my phone. The same channels I created for my laptop/desktop automatically are there with phone app. No set up or cumbersome issues to get started with app"
"January 24, 2012","I got this app for my T301 and it's AWESOME! I can jam to the radio all day long for FREE!"
"December 1, 2012","Used to be ok, but now is loaded with ads you have to watch or listen too and limitations , they try to force you to subscribe at $5 a month. No thanks, Removed."
"May 26, 2014","I didn't even get a chance to listen to music on Pandora because it will load on my Kindle for literally 2 seconds and then it says it timed out then goes back to the home screen. Seriously! It timed out after 2 seconds! I would rate this 0 stars if I could. I love Pandora the app works on my phone but why not this. I am uninstalling and reinstalling and hope that it is fixed."
"November 13, 2016","This site enables you to pick that one singer that you want to hear more of and create your station, voila, there you are, hearing your favorite singer, you can create as many stations you want, I have 7!!"
"December 16, 2016","Whether it's Pandora's problem or Amazon's, this is a problem that MUST be fixed. If there's one thing in the modern world that absolutely ought to work no less than 100% of the time, it's an alarm clock. Pandora on kindle does not. It works sometimes, maybe. Sometimes Pandora starts playing by itself at inappropriate times (maybe alarm related?). Today my 5am alarm went off...at 12:38pm. Connected to the internet the whole time every time. Pandora is a great service, and I will change my review to 5 stars once this critical error is reversed and works consistently."
"June 10, 2016","I like this app but the buffering is driving me crazy! I have a Kindle Fire and the app buffers like crazy at the beginning when you start to use it. Once it starts and you get the station or music you like its ok at that time."
"January 13, 2017","Absolutely LOVE it......I am 57 y/o and completely new to this .......... for 1st day after getting first BT Speaker for working out n shop SO The 1st day I tried that Heart station and within less than 4 hours started getting repeats and it was like having a short mp3 playlist ....got irritating and boing Real Quick...........DAY 2 Broke the HEART and installed Pandora, clicked Jack Johnson station and BLISS, eclectic mix and it has been 3 days now and if there have been repeats I have not noticed because I am TOO Busy dancing and Loving it 100% !! PERFECT"
"August 11, 2016","Best music app - listen to it every day. Option to block explicit lyrics is genius. Thumbs down on a song means you never have to hear it again. Thumbs up and you get more songs similar to that one. Absolutely brilliant."
"October 28, 2014","I use this for when I'm working on the computer or reading. A lot of different channels, but I tend to have a core set of about 8-9 that I listen to all the time. Also appreciate that Pandora can be set up to play when my Kindle is in sleep mode -- helps save on the battery. It also doesn't seem to interfere with the other applications -- although it will occasionally distort slightly (not all the time) when performing certain actions on a game or pulling up e-mail."
"March 25, 2017","Used everyday at work to listen to music makes work more bearable"
"March 23, 2017","I love listening to only the kinds of music I enjoy and after a couple of days using Pandora , that is what I got . The commercials are brief and few , so the free version is still very good . It was very user friendly and simple to navigate through . I think this is a good app ."
"January 22, 2013","I really do like this app. My niece turned me on to this app. It is a great music media app, it to me is one of the best apps for music. I really do like the different genres for music. The music really sounds good on the Kindle Fire HD, because of the dolby audio sound system. I could listen to it all day long. I would and have recommended it to friends."
"February 14, 2014","I love Pandora! I listen at home, in my car, at work, and everywhere in between. After a few months of teaching Pandora my likes versus dislikes, she truly has learned my tastes. When I change from my personal stations, I know exactly what I am going to get. I even enjoy mixing things up a bit when I dabble with the premade channels Pandora makes available. They are very good but my personal preference are the stations I create by choosing my favorite songs and genres. Great job Pandora."
"November 9, 2016","I'm impressed. It delivers pretty much what I listen too or request. No complaints."
"May 16, 2016","I didn't like this app because when I used it I didn't see video w it unlike utube it was boring just starring at my tablet watching the bands picture.i guess this is for music when ur on the go not for viewing"
"November 11, 2016","I love Pandora. It doesn't repeat songs over and over, it has almost evey artist younwould want. Love this, a total must have. Except for the fact that you habento pay for premium, but whatever."
"November 4, 2016","I love listening to my gospel music on this station"
"October 31, 2016","The idea of the program is great. But there are problems. One that occurs routinely is the loss of signal. The program will need to buffer. When that happens I need to open the application manager to force a program stop. Then when the program is reloaded it works again. Until the next time. A little more variety in audio programming would be good"
"March 1, 2013","I love music. I love all sorts of different music.  I love that I can go anywhere in my home, like the basement, garage, bedroom or take a shower, and still have the type of music play that I am in the mood for.  From the '60s to Spanish Guitar to Eclectic, I have it all.  I love the portability of it on my Kindle."
"February 23, 2015","Now Listen, Spotify is better because you can pick what songs you want to here! on pandora ypu have to wait until you find a song you like,Trust me spotify is better because when you get the game you can get a 7 day trial that lets you listen to your songs where ever you want (Without WiFi) and it gives you better quality and NO ADS (Even know there is not a lot of ads and it only has ads about GOOD songs) and Pandora gives you an ad after every song! And you can get spotify Premium but its like 10/20 dollars every Month witch is not that bad...But dont worry spotify is already good!And on spotify you can change the quality in your settings.Oh yeah i forgot to tell you on spotify right after your trial runs out you might need to reset your profile because it well start to not let you listen to your music (Maybe) and i hate that ad on pandora about Jim Carlyles.com its so annoying,But anyways i don't recommend this App unless you want to hear an ad after every song!"
"November 14, 2013","This is the bomb. I have been using it for 7 years via desktop and laptop, and now my Kindle also."
"December 29, 2016","Won't open on my Kindle Fire. I get a message that it cannot process my request, this after I downloaded it. Pretty annoying."
"May 20, 2017","sucks"
"April 8, 2014","Pandora is an amazing app to have if you want to listen to your favorite music and also hear new stuff just like what you love! They take the songs that you have liked and pick new songs to play based on what makes all of those songs the same. It's genious! Great was to discover new stuff and new artists. And it's an alternative to the radio which plays mostly the same music and an get annoying."
"February 27, 2016","Music just for me. Perfect. I have to chuckle every time I realize that the new station I just set up plays some of the songs from my old stations. Apparently I have very consistent tastes in music."
"January 23, 2013","It plays good music but it isn't very loud when the vol;ume of my kindle is on high. I would play it more if it was louder."
"March 31, 2015","The fact that Pandora continues to add ""stations"" turns an otherwise good idea into a normal/regular radio station which plays a large percentage of music one did not want to hear to begin with. Just because I like the Greatful Dead does not mean I will like Bob Marley for instance, so if I give something a thumbs down it should not form a. New radio station. And that's what makes Pandora suck, though the concept is great."
"February 7, 2015","Didn't care for it. I never was able to assemble a good play list. Too much repetition of songs I didn't like."
"January 25, 2016","Love Pandora radio - good variety of stations to choose from or make up your own. Pick a band you like and Pandora will create a station with your band of choice along with other singers or groups that fall into the same genre. Overall its a quality listening experience that you can take anywhere."
"August 23, 2013","ok"
"June 6, 2016","I can't live without my Pandora now. Takes a little patience to develop the perfect playlist (like a couple/three sessions of thumbs up or down), but it's SO worth it. I've discovered a lot of new music I might never have otherwise been exposed to."
"December 9, 2016","Was never able to download it so how can I review it?"
"May 17, 2016","Works well and introduces you to new music similar to the station you choose. sometimes good, sometimes not quite. Still, a good way to learn and appreciate all the great music there is. Just wish in the Classical stations they would play the entire piece rather than movements or excerpts. Guess listening to something longer than a few minutes is very old school."
"April 22, 2014","I'm still getting used to Pandora, but so far, I think it is Awesome! Wish there was just a membership fee instead of having to purchase individual tracks. I like just setting the station and letting it go. It's nice to be able to listen to any type of music that fits my mood at the time. We also enjoy listening to the comedy skits, especially the old classics. So, in a nutshell, I like it so far!"
"January 28, 2017","Great app, works well only droid maxi."
"October 9, 2016","I like Pandora. I would like you to do something for me. I have cerebral palsy and I like the best of Ronnie dove, and dusty Springfield. I also like leslie gore and early brenda lee. The thing is they are under different categories,. I would them all under leslie gore, so that I can listen to all together. Thank you for your attention."
"February 28, 2015","Pandora is the Best invention to happen to music! Where else can you Create your own radio stations according to your mood and the artists you like! I listen to them every day as much as possible. Amazon radio does not give you the choices. And it gives you information about the artist as it plays. An awesome way to discover new music and artists. Who needs old fashioned radio anymore?! Get it now! You won't be sorry."
"February 15, 2016","I LOVE my pandora, I listen to it 7 days a week, on my drive to and from work daily, and my wife and I both enjoy it on the weekends as we go to our various destinations in the car"
"July 17, 2016","After many conversations with represenatives we finally came to a successful ending on the Kindle Fire HDX seven inch. I'm still learning how to use it , it has awesome graphics and if you buy one Amazon does have cases for them but it's only for the HDX third generation.And you can put an 120 go SD card in it. Lots of movies lots of music.Enjoy"
"March 22, 2017","awesome app need to get it.they have AWESOME apps.if you think of getting it you should todaly and I am 9 years old and I really like this game the most of all games."
"April 30, 2017","you make it to hard to get help when you forget password I thought that was what the security words for help w/out all this code I will just quit ordering from youall"
"September 12, 2016","Not sure how to Close app on my Kindle (no 'x' top right to close). Other issues (delay, long silent pauses) may be due to my device, or cable connectivity (10GB), not the app, but I'm unclear. Also the UI isn't super intuitive i.e. how to look for other pre existing stations. But maybe I will like it more as I acclimate to the process. Thx!"
"February 5, 2017","It will take some time to get used to the format."
"April 25, 2017","amazon tablets are trash"
"December 19, 2015","Pandora and their patented Music Genome Project tech allows them to play new music to you based on your listening history.  The recommendations are almost always perfect, allowing me to hear new music I never would have encountered without Pandora. I have purchased music from bands I would have never listened to, and 99pct of whose music I find awful. But Pandora can find that one song that said band stuck on sone album five years ago, and see based on the songs Musical Genome that I might enjoy it. And I almost always do!  Pandora and its Music Genome Project are light years beyond any other music streaming sites algorithms based on genres, playlists or whatever. The music industry owes Pandora big time for keeping people like me buying music I never would have known was just my taste."
"February 9, 2017","I used to love Pandora.... however, recently the variety is limited and with the free version the ads were unbearable and way too frequent. Uninstalled, I now use the YouTube music app. No ads, and free with as much variation as I want."
"August 20, 2015","Upgraded to Pandora one and was still inundated with advertisements until I complained to customer service ... took some time but they fixed it .. still, felt like it was intentional for the benefit of advertisers."
"January 15, 2013","After using Songza with ease, I find Pandora to be more complicated & annoying with the audio ads. It's OK."
"May 18, 2017","2 much advertising! i want the old pandora with no distribution of nonsense.. download @ own risk lol sky is better or lil shark"
"June 3, 2017","Music for the Mind"
"May 14, 2016","I have been listening to Pandora for many years - I first saw it advertised when I was on the AARP internet page on the computer which belonged to my job - which I have retired from - it was advertised as Pandora Jukebox. I have it downloaded on my computer at home and my iPhone. I like that I get to choose the music I like to listen to - and I get to rate it. If I don't enjoy one of the songs that they are playing - I can stop it and go to the next one. I recommend Pandora to anyone who loves music as much as I do.."
"December 19, 2016","I wasn't able to log in so I did not use the app on my Kindle. Pandora said they couldn't log me in so maybe it was my mistake but after two tries, I gave up."
"February 5, 2013","One time I was listening to it (once it logged me properly) and I exited out. For some strange reason Selena Gomez was still singing. I logged into Twitter, still singing. It went to the next song (Jessie J, I believe). I shut it off and Jessie J continued to sing. I had to hold the power button down for 20 seconds, let go, and hold it down for 3 more seconds (that is how I re-boot my Kindle). I deleted the app the second my Kindle powered back up. I told all my friends and family about it, and now I'm telling you. Please fix this."
"October 23, 2016","I downloaded it on the 10/21/16. It was suppose 2 start my 7 day free trial period nd it won't work at all! It won't even allow my original free Pandora 2 play either."
"January 17, 2013","i think it is a cool pro g ram . i prefer to mix up genres a bit and have to listen one genre at a time"
"July 28, 2015","Its the evolution of broadcast radio, but better. I knew Pandora was available online, but I was delighted to find an app for it that works with my KindleFire. The sound is incredible. This app easily plays in the background while reading an e-book or surfing the web. I program only the types of music that I want to hear and it provides the lyrics to most songs, allowing you to become familiar with the artists, the titles and the albums of the songs you are hearing for future purchase, if you so choose."
"May 5, 2014","This is a really great app. I find the type of music that I want to listen to and go search, play games, or do whatever. Also it has free music . If you have a kindle fire (which i have) then you will love Pandora most of the songs on Pandora (that are good) are free and if you go on the buy music on Amazon it cost money but here on Pandora it's just FREE MUSIC. Tell me if this review helped. Well that's it hope you have a great time on Pandora. BYE"
"April 28, 2016","A frustrating app at times. It will occasionally pop up an overly that demands you either give the song its showing a thumb up or a thumb down. The only way to regain control of the app with out giving a thumb up or a thumb down is to exit the app and restart it. Very annoying. Paying for premium does not give unlimited skips like Spotify does."
"June 19, 2017","Not using"
"July 15, 2016","Pandora is alright at most, they always say they get the perfect song at the perfect moment and that is just dead wrong. You'll randomly listen to a radio station lets say country radio. At some point in your session you'll end up hearing rap or some completely different artist than the one you specifically went to a radio for"
"March 12, 2017","Great product!"
"February 22, 2013","I had siriusxm, which was fine,but it offered one at a time,Elvis,Frank Sinatra,Dean martin,or Country. with Pandora I get all four with out changing stations."
"March 14, 2017","Great product"
"February 23, 2013","OMG! I got rid of my smart phone due to the cost. My boyfriend and I were talking about music. He said how much he loves Pandora. I used to have it with my phone. I bought a Kindle Fire a few months ago. He informed me that I could get the app on my Kindle. I was THRILLED! Oh Pandora how I have missed thee!"
"March 24, 2017","I love Pandora and have been following it since the beginning. I told my dad that it would be everywhere one day and, I'll be darned if it isn't standard in a lot of cars and TVs now. It still beats all the new services, like Spotify, since I think the system of music ""DNA"" they use is better at creating channels that introduce you to new music."
"July 30, 2013","If you like one of them you liked them all. I don't understand why it's a limit on your response."
"November 17, 2014","This app is really cool for like parties and get togethers but most of the time when you done like a song as soon as you go to skip the song a ad pops up and you end up clicking the add and it lags your device. One thing I really like about Pandora is that when you give a song a thumbs down it says that they will never play that song again. I don't know if that's true. I really like this app you should get it"
"January 15, 2017","Some things about this irk me. You are supposed to be able to hear a song repeat after watching an ad, but it doesn't repeat. The ads are the same over and over. When I put a groups name in for my station, I want the majority of music from that group, not everyone but the group."
"June 15, 2016","Exposed to a huge variety of music. I didn't realize the many different types of music and artist I liked. Con: classical music will be truncated - you will not hear an entire symphony"
"May 23, 2017","Can only get one song to play before Pandora freezes."
"December 31, 2011","A friend recommended this app as a must have for my new fire, so i figured I would give it a try. It's a nice enough app but wasn't what I was looking for at all. If you are looking for a BASIC music selection then this might work for you, if you have more eclectic tastes then I would suggest TuneIn (another free app) Why? First TuneIn is easier to navigate with a simple home page to start you off. Second right from the start you can see the wider variety of options available to you. TuneIn presents you with 4 main choices - TALK, SPORTS, LOCAL RADIO, & MUSIC Just sticking with the music sections for comparative purposes Pandora gives you 23 ""genres"" and TuneIn 25 - I know what you're thinking - not that big a difference right? That's what I thought too on my first glance - but when you check closer you see how really lacking Pandora is. Since my main interest in an internet radio was the ability to access stations from around the world I will compare this ""genre"". 1 of Pandora's 23 genres is ""World"" - click on it and you are presented with .... wait for it.... Reggae, Contemporary Bollywood, Celtic, Dancehall, Worldbeat, Hawaiian, Classic Bollywood, Dub, African Essentials, Ska, Contemporary Reggae, Indian Classical, Cajun YUP 13 channels. Let's start by looking for some Jpop - no Asian choices so let's go with ""worldbeat"" right? Silly person that I am, I assumed that when you clicked on ""worldbeat"" you would be presented with more options to narrow down where in the world you would like to listen to right? WRONG. Click the Worldbeat channel and it just starts playing songs from around the world. Nice I guess, but not what I was looking for. In comparison click TuneIn's ""World"" genre and - well look at that - the world's a little bit bigger than we thought! TuneIn gives you 37 regions of the world to help narrow down your choice (such as Africa, Arabic, Caribbean, Dutch, German, Irish, Japanese, Native, Polish, Romanian, Turkish & Vietnamese just to name a few!decide you want to search by language? That's not a problem either!) Let's get the Jpop started by clicking ""Japanese"". Had this been the case I would have been more than satisfied! But wait? What is this?? click on Japanese and you will get this - ""Results 1 - 25 of about 257"" Wait?? You mean ALL Japanese music is not the same?? You are offered a range of stations from actual radio stations in Japan, to streaming internet stations such as a station from Herndon, VA(apparently nothing is better when you are snowed in then a little anime and jpop top 40!). Now just like your local community station on TV isn't going to compare to ABC or NBC, sometimes it IS what you are looking for. Both apps include commercials (which didn't bother me on either) A con for TuneIn is that sometimes the stations are not available, but with the large selection this isn't much of a setback. TuneIn will also suggest similar stations if the one you want is currently unavailable. (Please note- I wasn't on Pandora enough to know if it occurs there as well.) TuneIn also offers features like a sleep function and an alarm setting (If Pandora has them they I didn't find them.) So overall, while I think Pandora is a fine app I really like the versatility of TuneIN."
"November 10, 2015","Love Pandora and the great variety available for the song mix It's easy to use whether listening to one genre or choosing to shuffle. I'm technologically challenged (seriously) & until recently only listened on my desktop Now I listen on my tablet everywhere I go."
"March 9, 2017","I have been using pandora for a few year love this music stations you can make so much freedom to do what you want but there adds so only 4 star i know they need to make money but every time you skip a song play a add overkill... still a great place to listen to music if you want to start it and forget about so you do other thing and not have start a new video are pick new song every time a song ends."
"January 22, 2013","Pandora is free, it's great for finding new music in a particular genre. The only problem is, it keeps playing after you exit the app, That's great if you want music while you work on other things, but not so great if you do not, I cannot find any way to shut it off other than turning the whole Kindle off."
"March 22, 2013","This app is great! Love the ideas it gives you for similar music and artists! Also like shuffle feature and ability to control which artist or genres it shuffles. Only thing that's mildly irritating is how slowly it goes back and forth to show you info re. artist, words to lyrics, similar artists, etc. But that could be my Kindles problem or internet speed. Over all I love it!"
"April 28, 2017","Learns what I like."
"November 18, 2016","This is an amazing app. YOU CAN LISTEN TO ANIME MUSIC😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 I have to say that this is an Awsomazing app and I recommend it for anyone who's a music fanatic like me. (You will never have lived your life if you don't get this app!!!!😋😋😋😋😋😁😁😁😁) (just sayin')😜"
"June 16, 2014","You shouldn't get this app. I would go off while you are playing a game, or searching on the internet. Also if you create your own playlist it wouldn't even play most of the songs you put on there. It has barely any songs. It only has popular songs, or popular artists. So I recommend you to get spotify instead"
"August 28, 2016","Pandora is great for finding music similar to what I like. I use it on my PC all the time. I don't use it on my phone much since it uses the cell data plan when not on Wifi. It would be great if it would download say 30 minutes of music to listen to off-line. Then I could use it on my commute to/from work and such without paying me for cell data."
"March 25, 2017","OK"
"September 18, 2014","I LOVE Pandora! I can listen to all my favorite artists and songs with the push of a button (or touch of a screen, rather). The only downside is that you can't search specific songs. You just have to create a station and hope for the song you want to hear. Another great feature is that you can listen to stuff other than music too. I have a comedy station that brings up comedian routines, not songs."
"July 19, 2016","You can pick your own great tunes and is super easy to navigate if you want to skip a song. It's great for grouping similar artists without one having to do it themselves."
"October 4, 2013","I keep getting a constant message saying ""sorry, we have no more songs to play on this station,please select another."" I reported it numerous times to Pandora and I get the same response from them ""were sorry for the frustration..try this...were sorry try this...and try that..."" I've deactivated my account 4 times and it still keeps happening. I have Pandora One which is $3.99 a month and I'm ready to cancel it."
"October 5, 2017","Able to create multiple stations, you can listen to any type of music you want."
"January 23, 2013","This is a first rate site!  I love picking my own type of music and choosing or deleting songs by a particular artist until I only have songs I love from that artist! It is free if you do not mind some quick commercials, or you may purchase the site for a monthly rate or by the year."
"March 9, 2017","Awesome app"
"August 31, 2013","Its flat out horrible you have to have a account and also Its such a waste of time and when I tried to actually search for a song it kept saying you need to register and I even tried un download ing it and redownloading it and it still acted up o So what ever you do don't download this app it will not be worth it and also I think I sound is even a better radio app than this so why even bother with this I say screw it"
"June 23, 2016","There's no app for phone, it times out, the setup is confusing, and the box that cost $200 doesn't show what bands are playing or channel. The channels,how ever, are amazing."
"April 29, 2017","I love Pandora so this is a review of the app for amazon. It kinda sucks on Fire, but i'm going to assume that's because I purchased a marginally acceptable $39 tablet.."
"July 10, 2016","I love it, in a way. The stations seem lazy. I wish there were more perfectness about the songs chosen, more variety. This could be a result of my clicking patterns...or not..."
"November 21, 2016","Good app"
"November 3, 2016","Greate"
"September 23, 2013","I have had it for years...Love it. I have it on my phone, computer, Roku, and now my Kindle. Thanks"
"December 5, 2013","It use to work perfectly, not any more. Now every time I try to open it it just freezes on the Pandora screen."
"June 19, 2017","There's nothing like hearing the tunes you like sounding so smooth and mellow. I just like listening to my favorite tunes on Pandora."
"November 19, 2013","Used to work great, then stopped. I updated hoping it would fix it but made it worse. It used to begin playing eventually after a few times of exiting and restarting program. Now, it usually won't. Also, I play lullabies for my baby (when it works) and before the update there were rarely commercials. Now loud, multiple ones play at random, which is fine when she is awake, sucks when she just dozed off."
"November 21, 2014","pandora is not a good product when compared to Rdio as Rdio not only lets you play stations but let you pick individual songs and listen to playlists and publisher playlists and there's a Roku station Android iTunes everything just a great product. I used Pandora for a while but I was so sick of the repetitiveness in the poor music selection that I have given up on them forever"
"September 11, 2015","I have Pandora on every device we own as a family. I have been using it for years. It is great for all ages and I even pay for Pandora One on my personal device, Love having no commercials. But even with commercials its great. All types of music and even kids songs! Plug it in your car, we use at cook outs, camping, just around the house while cleaning!"
"August 21, 2014","The periodicity and number of the advertisements are totally annoying and disruptive to listening - it may as well be listed & advertised as a freebie trial version. I've never used a music app that interrupted the continuity of my listening and disrupted my mood as much as Pandora does. Defeats the purpose of using such an app. I would have to buy the ad-free version to have it. There are too many other free apps that substitute and can replace this one. After all the hype, I was totally disappointed."
"March 12, 2014","I've loved using this app on my Kindle Fire very frequently in the past but since updating, the sleep timer isn't listed in the drop-down menu or anywhere else. I tried emailing Pandora Media about it but the link doesn't work and they don't provide any other way to contact them. If they fix this and put the sleep timer back in their menu, they will get three stars from me. I won't go to give stars because of their very invasive permissions. They don't need all that info and its none of their business!"
"April 17, 2013","I am enjoying exploration of this product to hear country music from the 50's. I would recommend the free version. I'm not ready for the monthly charge version yet!"
"April 12, 2014","Pandora is quite simply the go-to destination when you are looking for a particular genre of music you can dial in and let play. It's never let me down for variety of newer and older favorites of whatever type of music I am in the mood for and the best thing is, you can take it anywhere. I like having it on my phone for portability in the car to hook up to my cars stereo or at home on my computer or stereo. Wherever you are, wherever you go, be it near or far, it's Pandora!"
"January 17, 2017","I used to use slacker radio all the time but i have recently switched to Pandora just for the option to mix my stations together. I listen about two hours every day while driving to and from work and i still haven't gotten bored with it. I do wish it would be easier to use with other devices, I usually hook up my laptop to my TV to use my whole house sound system while I'm cleaning, it would be so much easier to just play it from the Playstaion."
"May 15, 2017","No"
"April 14, 2017","They play good music once ina blue moon I switched to spotify it's 10000000 times better!!!!!!! U can add the songs u like to ur library!!"
"November 23, 2016","Junk."
"June 26, 2013","I'm not a kid and don't get too worked up about ""my favorite apps"" and don't spend the day staring at my phone if you know what I mean. I absolutely love pulling up Pandora's 'oldies' stations on my tablet, plugging in the earphones and relaxing while my wife watches reality TV shows. ;o)  Pandora is a pleasant surprise."
"May 17, 2016","I chose 50s country. Rockabilly, with Patsy Cline, Rick Nelson, and others played for a few minutes. Not necessarily my favorite, but not bad. Then out of the blue, the next song began playing horrible lyrics, with the ""F bomb"" repeating, over and over and OVER, as I frantically tried to close it. Last time I checked, 50s country did NOT have those lyrics!!! I exited that app, never to return. I'll stick to my ""iheart radio,"" thank you."
"December 18, 2016","just downloaded pandora yesterday , have not actually used it yet.. to be honest can't give a review. t"
"February 22, 2013","I can listen to any music I choose on my laptop as well as my tablet! It's perfect for ""tuning out"" when I need to. I don't know how I ever lived without it! The small and infrequent ads are no bother, but you can purchase ad-free if you wish! Try it, you won't regret it!"
"January 21, 2013","I get to listen to all the old songs I remember as a child while I do my schoolwork. I logged in to just hear one song, and I stayed on for an hour b/c the other songs were songs I liked...I had to force myself to shut it down so I could get some sleep and get ready for work in the morning."
"September 23, 2016","I enjoy Pandora and listen daily at work for lengthy periods. My only issue is that for the number of available songs within a specific genre, I'd prefer not to hear the same set of songs every two hours. The ability to add or remove artists to a channel has become more difficult while on mobile."
"June 12, 2016","Wish i could give less than a star. I am tired of getting a skip limit when i don't want to listen to certain songs on my stations. Also Pandora is apparently not available to certain countries such as Ecuador. So when i was down there i couldn't even use the service or even cancel my service. Now back in the US i cancelled my subscription. Not dealing with it anymore after being a customer for a few years. Wish i cancelled it sooner. I have thousands of songs on my hard-drive just was lazy to deal with it."
"May 30, 2017","WON'T LET ME SET UP AN ACCOUNT....SAYS ""CAN'T CONNECT NOW"" ...WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?"
"November 20, 2016","Don't find myself using this so I took it off so I can't rate it honestly. Gave it an average as its on the Apple apps so hope it's at least average. Sorry to rate like this. I have friends who do use Pandora and like it. I don't understand it and don't play much music on my phone."
"March 19, 2017","Love Pandora and how easy it is to customize. Even the free version isn't that ad filled. Have it on all my mobile devices."
"January 7, 2014","One star due to the lack of function on my kindle fire hd. I love my pandora on my droid phone."
"November 29, 2016","Locks up over and over again if I'm even lucky enough for it to load and actually ""play music."" If, by the grace of Zeus, it actually DOES start playing a song, It's almost guaranteed to crash with the first advertisement that comes through and slogs up my system resources."
"September 26, 2016","Pandora affords me the opportunity to listen to just the type of music that i am in the mood for if i feel nostalgic i listen to the music of the 50s or boleros if i feel moody i listen to jazz it all depends on the the mood get it you wont be disappointed"
"February 21, 2014","It is okay. If you want to listen to one or two bands that you like, this works.  This app has too many commercials compared to other apps of its type.  The customization based on likes and dislikes is terrible. For 2, maybe 3, songs after you hit ""like"" it will play similar sounding songs, but it has gone far off track far more times than I would like.  Pandora also does not carry nearly as many unheard of bands as another app that I frequently use."
"September 28, 2016","Wonderful"
"July 12, 2017","I don't want to listen to OTHER PEOPLE'S SONG, I want to listen to MY SONG, so please make a urgent update because it's so annoying to listen a song that yoiu don't want to hear or even know about!! Think about that before publishing a music app!!"
"May 3, 2016","It has quite a lot of music available for streaming, but in my opinion setting up your ""radio station"" is not very user friendly or intuitive."
"October 13, 2016","Love Pandora and everything about it except the commercials but hey that is what you have to live with, when it is for free!"
"January 20, 2013","Although I am a new user, Pandora has been around long enough to use listener preferences to assemble a great anticipated playlist. It is an easy start up, even for those of us who are on the downhill side of life. The commercials are not a bad price for such a quality service."
"December 12, 2015","Pandora is still one of my favorite stations to listen to. I just wish it didn't have so much ads. I find myself listening all the time while cleaning. The ability to choose the artist that I love in comparison with other artists like him makes it all the more better."
"July 4, 2017","They have changed Pandora and I do not like all the changes. For some reason my Pandora on my computer is really acting up. I use to love Pandora now I just like it."
"December 15, 2015","I have been a huge Pandora fan loved it! I recommended to all my friends, well until I had to update it, the new update sucks! I hate the layout then it just randomly stops playing, I'll think it's an add coming on but NO it just stops. Sorry Pandora WAS a loyal fan and listener but ill be finding a new radio app!"
"December 26, 2016","I have yet to be able to log into this app. I have not been able to log into it due to technical problems or so it says."
"August 13, 2013","Music, yes, but unless you go for more than the free app, you aren't choosing your music. It is Pandora 'radio,' not Pandora 'you pick it, you play it.' If you don't like the chosen song, you must still listen to it. It may not be just what I wanted, but I still give it credit. It is an awesome radio station and it is introducing me to a lot of new music based on the bands I do listen to which is far better than listening to the average airwave radio station. Based on ease of use and the fact that it was free, you can't hardly go wrong with this one. :P"
"June 27, 2017","i couldn't get it finished. didn't understand it. got frustrated and quit."
"February 20, 2015","Great music and a broad selection. Easy Access with excellent audio on my Kindle."
"August 29, 2013","I love this app. I love being able to personalize my own stations so that I get to hear the music I want to hear."
"August 10, 2013","I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD. I enjoy classical music, and I set up a Mozart station. It played one piece of Mozart music (from Eine Kliene Nacht Music. Really??? Can't you do better than that?)) Then it played some Beethoven. Then it played an ad. Two pieces of music, and then an ad. I naively had visions of intelligent listening of classical music, but all I got were 2 pieces classical ""Pop"" music and then an ad. I immediately removed it from my Kindle."
"February 20, 2015","Too many ads, you have to pay to get rid of them. They put albums in your radio station even though I only want 1 song. It's a pain to set up specially since I already have my own music player with only so go I like. :>p I am deleting."
"April 6, 2014","I deleted it after I downloaded it onto my phone. When I agreed to ""permissions"" during the download it said I could change them in my settings after the download was completed. This is not true. And I do not like the idea of them having access to all my files, photos, etc. So I got rid of the app. I have Slacker radio anyway so I don't really need Pandora too."
"November 4, 2016","I have been a Pandora customer for a long time. It's my choice when working out, at work, or when I just want to relax."
"November 30, 2014","I suppose this app is okay if one listens to only English music. I listen exclusively to Italian & French music. It is next to impossible to find the artists I love. Antonio Maggie, Emmanuel Moire, Tiziano Ferro, Sinsemilia, Paolo Meneguzzi, Povia. The app assumes I do not mean what I type in the search bar. It is useless to me. I emailed Pandora support, I heard nothing back. I will find another app that doesn't presume & actually reads my search criteria."
"February 1, 2013","Can't get this to work on my kindle. Either won't accept my sign in or won't load. Unsure - doesn't work!"
"November 8, 2014","After I downloaded, I never got in successfully to listen to any music. It kept spooling, and then, after it had me set up my user name and password, twice, it told me that there was an error and to contact their support. After 5 minutes of waiting, I hung up and uninstalled the program from my phone. My kids love it; but my experience was awful. iHeart Radios was smooth and easy to download and I've never had a problem with it......guess I'll use that from now on."
"September 2, 2013","I use this app all the time on my phone so I was excited to see it in the Amazon app store. I downloaded it, opened it at work, and... It worked great! Once. Now I have been unable to even get past the blue start up screen. I've tried uninstalling an reinstalling, turning my Wi-Fi on and off, and restarting my Kindle. No dice. Would give five stars but the app simply doesn't work."
"December 30, 2015","Like many other recent reviewers said, the app doesn't work on kindle fire (or at least not on mine and theirs). Everything but the actual music will work -- I can see the songs playing, they just don't make any noise despite having the volume up. I'm disappointed and I hope they offer a solution soon."
"January 19, 2016","Music app for my tablet"
"September 27, 2016","More music then all the thousands of dollars that I wish I saved VS what was wasted on CDs and tapes, LPs and cassettes & Itunes It's a good app BUT now they stop it after 15 min.s of play, Ask you if your still listening, it stinks now before it was like a radio with your favourite songs, Now you have to press the button & start it again, Time to get another app, many others, so long,,, Maybe back if you go back to the old way"
"October 23, 2013","I can listen and work to all my favorites in one afternoon..easy to use and switch stations and nice it keeps record of them"
"January 11, 2017","I have had Pandora for years ! I absolutely love it and the selection of channels and variety of music they have available. I am giving this a four star rating because I do wish new music would become available a little bit more often other than every few weeks on the stations you select to listen to. If you are looking for a good music station, I highly recommend Pandora. My absolute favorite internet radio station of all time !"
"January 30, 2014","what can I say it's the best yet I love the music I hear all the time reminds me when you could walk down the street with my transitter radio it's from my youth in the 60s love Motown. thank you very very much."
"June 14, 2014","Pandora definitely has much more variety than your average radio station. All I listen to is Pandora now but I come across the same songs all the time. It seems as though they play only the popular songs or have no k n owing of any different miles you have been listening for hours. I sometimes Mark the thumbs down on some songs and somehow they still play in time . I just wish they could come up with more updated songs and add more than what they've been playing."
"September 21, 2016","Often need to uninstall, reinstall and losing all your favorites. When it works, very nice even with annoying commercials."
"May 2, 2016","I have been with Pandora from the beginning but as of late things are getting bad.  Fix permissions. Stop asking for location data. This is a radio program you dont need to know where I am. It wold be ok but even with locations off you keep pestering for it to be on. No means no. Pandora permissions keep getting more invasive. Creepy. If it isn't fixed will swap to new app.  If you have older versions dont updated."
"January 30, 2013","Pandora is a creative and entertaining way to receive music from your favourite artists. You type In an artist and Pandora will play songs and artists that are similar to the artists genre. While you listen to music you may go online or play games at the same time. Pandora allows you to skip a limited amount of tracks. You can only skip about 5 songs on that station. Although you may skip about five more tracks again after an hour. There is also ads between songs, but probably after every 5 or more songs. You can pay with an ad-free experience with Pandora for around $6.00. Another thing I like about Pandora is that if you see a song you like it will ask you if you want to buy it on iTunes or bookmark it. On Pandora you cannot replay a track or rewind it. I enjoy my experience with pandora and I think it is worth buying."
"June 22, 2015","This app is full of advertisements, even more than the website has. I was okay with the ads between songs but now the app plays video ads between songs too. There's also a ad in left hand corner so whenever I like or dislike a song I am hit with another ad. All the ads I get between every song has ruined this app for me."
"December 7, 2013","I've always loved Pandora but on my Kindle it won't open up other than showing me the blue green opening Pandora screen. Really sucks cause I've been a loyal Pandora user for a long time. Hopefully it gets fixed."
"October 20, 2013","I thought I'd download the app on my kindle fire HD just to see if all the reviews were true. They. Are. True. It's very frustrating that it works on a computer but not on my kindle. When you click on the app, it just shows the beginning screen and doesn't change. I hope they fix the bugs! (I can't complain too much because the app was free, but it's still frustrating.)"
"August 31, 2013","I love Pandora and am a paid subscriber. However, every time I want to launch it I have to go into Apps and do a shut down. It doesn't always shut down internally even though I use the QUIT feature. Then it will launch ok. I talked to kindle support about this several weeks ago and they were able to reproduce the problem. They said they would research and get back to me within five days but I'm still waiting. I am getting ready to call them back."
"February 23, 2013","I just love Pandora - In the classroom I utilize their music to calm down my students....in my home I listen to my favorite type of music and so does my husband.....they really have a variety of music to choose from.....from the newest to the oldies...."
"March 17, 2015","We have Pandora streaming to our kindle and via a Roku to our TV. The install on each device was easy. We set up 1 station & enjoyed hours of music on it. I like the variety on the menus of song titles - I'm anticipating being able to change collections of music easily & doubt that I'll get bored."
"January 31, 2015","I happen to be 11 years old and you need an email to use this... I don't have an email... there fore I claim this app to stink and is very unfair to other kids lacking the unneeded and stupid requirements this app needs just to play songs... why would you need an email to listen to a song...😑😑😑 not cool pandora... not cool...."
"August 5, 2014","Im not that happy with Pandora right now i've been having problems with the application for some reason it just stalls and won't keep playing music i've never had this problem in the past but since it updated im guessing that something went wrong !!!"
"January 5, 2014","To be honest, I dropped this before actually trying on my new tablet. I've had a good experience using it on a friends tv quite a while ago, but the requirements from the company now...! Unbelievable what they require."
"May 17, 2016","Good"
"May 16, 2017","unable to answer too many questions we have asked. hoping as time goes by, things will improve"
"May 5, 2016","I love the Pandora app a lot, but it has so many glitches. Like one of them is that it won't let me delete my bookmarks. I tried to delete the app and reinstall it and see if that was the issue but it wasn't, please fix it! But other than that the design of the app is awesomes."
"November 21, 2012","slow as balls sometimes to load new songs, have to restart a lot. seven more words are required there you go"
"December 20, 2015","I have had a Pandora One subscription for many years. Love the quality for the cost. I use it on my cell phone, laptop & notebook. I listen to my favorite stations during morning and evening commutes to and from work. Helps keep me sane. No loud annoying commercials anymore like on the radio. Hate the radio now and refuse to listen to it anymore since I've been listening to Pandora. I'm thoroughly spoiled and will never go back! My family is hooked too."
"April 19, 2014","I am not a young kid so I don't know how to use Pandora. I also don't see any instructions on how to use it. So in my opinion, I don't like it. Can't use it until I see my nephew."
"June 23, 2014","a great way to listen to music that you want to listen to. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to listen to music of their choice"
"February 23, 2013","This is really great you get to listen to your favorite songs. if you don't like the song just put no and it will go to the next one. You can also do other things while you are listening to it. I am listening to it right now. I hope you like it"
"February 4, 2013","it kept wanting me to sign in and would not take my password and then they would ask for a new one and wouldn't take it."
"June 12, 2017","This showed as a purchase in my account and I did not purchase it. I now have to jump through more security hoops to secure my account though I THOUGH I had a pretty secure password."
"April 29, 2016","Pandora tried to take over my phone.Every time I got out of an app. Pandora came on.I like Pandora but I will choose when to play it."
"July 1, 2017","A fine way to take music along as you go. I don't like the commercials, but the price is right."
"August 17, 2013","I love this app on my smart phone so I decided to download it to my Kindle Fire HD. The app worked great at first but n ow when I try to listen to it, the app won't open. I'll stick to using Pandora on my phone until this version gets fixed. Too bad, cause it was nice while it lasted."
"November 16, 2014","This app is awful. It plays 1, maybe 1 1/2 songs then gets interrupted by a popup ad and the music stops playing. I love Pandora on my computer at work and even enjoy using it on my streaming devices and my phone, but for some reason it does not like working on my kindle. If I could give zero stars, I would."
"May 14, 2016","I love my Pandora App. I use it daily to listen to music. I can never find anything good on the radio so I always turn to my Pandora App for my number one source of music. It's super easy to use. Just type in a band, artist, or song you like and Pandora will suggest different songs and Artists that sound similar to what you have chosen. You can thumbs up or thumbs down songs that you don't like and Pandora won't play those any longer. The more you rate and customize your stations the more Pandora will play only songs that you like. It's perfect for me for when I'm listening to music in my car, at the gym, or just about anytime I want to hear music. I have to say that this has got to be one of my favorite apps ever."
"July 9, 2014","When I first started Pandora I thought it was great, not once did it mess up. Then Today when they updated it it crashes sometimes, and my comments stopped working. I had to create a new account, my old account had 157 followers and I comment on any, songs, or people's pages. It was once 5 stars now it's 1. I still use it though"
"October 8, 2017","I need my music and music Pandora provides! Just wish the price for premium was lower."
"December 30, 2012","TALK ABOUT ADS AND COMMERCIALS! ATTEMPT CHANGING SONG OR ARTIST AND POP UP ADS SPROUT UP LIKE WEEDS AND COVER MOST OF THE SCREEN. YOU SPEND MORE TIME DELETING ADS THAN LISTENING TO MUSIC, ONLY TO FIND COMMERCIALS ON THE NETWORK. RATHER LISTEN TO MY OWN CD PLAYLISTS I CREATED."
"March 28, 2016","I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Pandora app on my Galaxy Note 4 TWICE in the last 3 weeks. I would like to note that I PAY $4.99 a month for Pandora...whatever glitch they have going on with this &#34;new and improved&#34; app needs to addressed PRONTO!"
"April 5, 2017","Hmmm,???? I don't remember buying this. It must have come as a free app on my phone. Guess I'll have to check it out."
"April 2, 2014","Too many ads getting in the way, good thing this was a free app. I won't pay more to get rid of the ads"
"April 24, 2016","Been listening too and loving Pandora for nearly ten years. The app was going to be a dream come true but my kindle fire choked and vomited the app after one song. No sound and never-ending buffering. Fail indeed. Much disappoint."
"June 25, 2017","Controls are easy and they even give out tutorial!!! All of it is free too"
"October 15, 2016","Pretty good BUT could use less commercials (not more which seems to be the case) and expand the library."
"February 20, 2015","Get Spotify not Pandora."
"July 5, 2017","It doesn't matter if I listen to a station for 3 hours or 20; I can thumbs up and down all day long and still it plays the same 20 songs by the same10 artist. I normally listen everyday while I get ready for work. I'm so sick of some songs and artists by the end of the week I have to delete them from the station: Katy Perry, Lady GaGa, Journey, Hootie and The Blowfish, Goo Goo Dolls and LL Cool J are this weeks victims. Everytime I click any station it's the same five songs that start it. Every. Single. Time. This is great when Iove a new tund. It's torture otherwise. The whole app is more often than not, a waste to me. Sure, I like that song but I dont want to hear it every single day in almost the exact order. I'll just listen to the radio if I want the same stuff over and over. I have about 10 stations I made, 5-10 others made and there is no difference between how often it overplays each song. I've tried the shuffle feature and somehow end up with Christmas music every 3rd song. There used to be an ""add variety"" feature but I've had no luck finding it on my Kindle. The app, for me, is only good for very limited use. Likewise, I don't always have limitless hours to thumbs up or down so on some stations that has made the listening experience almost painful. I used to appreciate the Genome aspect for finding songs I would enjoy. Now it's just a hassle."
"March 16, 2016","I had 2 stations, and none of the songs would play. Advertisements worked as well as commercials, but the songs wouldn't play, and would switch after a couple of minutes as if they did. Tried restarting a couple of times and that didn't work. Ridiculous."
"September 18, 2016","What's not to love about Pandora? Free music of my choice, artists of my choice, and the option to shuffle music for hours on end. Sure there are the occasional commercials, but they can easily be tuned out just like tv commercials. I really wish I could get Pandora on my home stereo system, and also would like to get it in my vehicle, but I do not own a cell phone. LOVE< LOVE Pandora"
"June 5, 2017","So many artists, so many genres, so many stations, so much great music!!"
"November 4, 2014","Ads the Instant You Join is bat s***e crazy in terms of over the top, customer insulting, crack addict revenue-ing. Ad Mad is taught now in Marketing clearly. Jam it down customers' throats like feed to the goose for enlarged livers for pate. I wasn't on for 1 minute before the full page ads stopped everything. Smaller old school Ad Banners are dead? FULL PAGE INTERRUPTS are of the new expected toleration level? Not."
"June 24, 2017","Pretty good. Lots competition. Does good job at recording my likes and customizing my stations"
"December 19, 2012","I use this app on my kindle daily, it is perfect because it allows the music to be heard in a large room. I love pandora!"
"December 22, 2013","The free Pandora Kindle Fire app interrupts the music with advertisement. It also stops playing music and asks if you want to upgrade to a fee version - you have to answer and then tell it to go back to playing the music. If you want some background music while working around the house this isn't a very good option. I went back to playing Pandora on my Blue-ray player because it doesn't have as many interruptions."
"October 21, 2015","I love my Pandora! I can stream the music I am in the mood for anytime, anywhere, on my desktop computer, any mobile device, and in my car using my aux cable to my phone, all commercial free. I can create stations by a favorite artist and all similar will play. I have discovered a few new artists this way that have become favorites as well! I don't need CDs, Satellite radio, an MP3 player, or anything!"
"June 22, 2016","This app used to work but now it will only play music for 1 second then stop completely. Please fix or update thank you"
"October 7, 2015","I mean the app is great but if I could control what I listen to that would be great. I am a big fan of 1d and every time I go on 1d radio I get 5 seconds of summer. And I hate them I like Pandora but I like spotlight more! It lEts you pick the artist you want to listen to. Nothing against Pandora but sorry spot ivy is better. Better upgrade because spotify is bringing it up to a higher level than you!!"
"January 23, 2014","Whenever I sign in it says it's having technical difficulties. I've logged off of my account on my phone and then in again to check the password but it's still now working."
"May 30, 2015","i don't think i should have to pay for pandora one, also woul like more diversity in music, like on sirusxm, i am unable to subscribe to this doe to my bose soundtouch20, was not informed of this ehen i purchased this system. be careful when buying this system as they told me i would be able to purchase this station. however i like pandora but i like a little more than what you get on the pop stations!"
"April 5, 2013","I enjoy Pandora because I can listen to the type of music I like and I don;t have to keep changing the station I just put in the type of music I like and they just keep pulling up artist that play that kind of music"
"December 2, 2013","I can't log on to Pandora with this POS. ""We're experiencing unexpected technical errors."" I can get in with browsers but not with this thing. It's deleted from my Kindle."
"February 25, 2015","At first Pandora was great, I loved it, heard songs I haven't heard since I was young. After about a month of listening; one song would come on and then two commercials, after that nothing. I have to back out of the app and start over. Then the same problem would occur. Can somebody tell me why?"
"October 13, 2017","When I switched to Premium I started having a lot of problems with the app."
"April 21, 2015","Used to work. Now it won't load a single song on WiFi or LTE. I WAS a pandora one subscriber. No longer and never again will I pay for this terrible service. Also it plays the same songs OVER and OVER. I can't even reccomend the free app because it is so full of advertisements. Amazon music, spotify, Sony music unlimited, and Google's music service are all much better. Amazon music is probably the best."
"June 10, 2013","Pandora used to be really good, but lately, they have been making all these new rules and guidelines. It works well but it's hard to enjoy it because of these new rules. I do NOT recommend this to anyone!"
"December 9, 2013","I don't mind a commercial a few times an hour, it almost like listening to radio - sometimes after 2 songs... I am sorry, but I'm never going to buy a Jeep or Lexus. I have switched to Jango and grooveshark. And deleted it off my devices. Also it is always on, you have to force close Pandora as well to completely turn off."
"January 23, 2013","How can you go wrong with App, you have a choice of any music you want, and I absolutely love it!!"
"November 21, 2013","Before the newest update Pandora was doing just fine and know when ever I try to open it it ether crashes or it won't load any o the songs. It just seas 00:00-00:00 and won't play the song and just sits there. I have tried un installing it and re installing it but nothing changed sadly. I was happy with the app until know."
"June 22, 2017","Hadn't used it all that much, yet! When I did it quit twice during a song."
"January 24, 2014","I was using the free Pandora with the ads and my husband told me about this. I really like that I don't have to deal with advertisements while listening to my music."
"June 17, 2017","Has everything.. Had a great selection of you like new age."
"May 9, 2015","I have heard a lot of great things about Pandora, so I thought I would try it out. The only problem is, I can't try it out. This will not let me sign in to any e mail account. Please fix this Pandora."
"March 2, 2015","When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer of 3.99 per month. All went well until my bank decided to change my debit/credit card due to hacking of local stores. Well then they didn't get paid. Instead of contacting me, they just cancelled the account. When I realized it I started Pandora again expecting to use the old account. Oh no, now I get charged 4.99 per month through my phone provider. . Then I had to get my phone replaced under warranty defect, and when I restarted Pandora it would just quit playing after a couple songs, and actually froze up. I contacted them with the problem and their online chat person had me uninstall, and then re-install Pandora. Now I am on the free use of Pandora with occasional advertisements, and I think I am going to leave it that way, because I have the feeling they just want more. I don't mind paying, but really, when you pick a music theme or performer, it plays the same songs over and over. So I think the free version is sufficient."
"February 20, 2016","I love this app. It is great. It has all the music you want to listen to. You can set your own listening preferences. You can skip a song if you don't like it and it won't be played on your track anymore after that. You can have several different listening channels so you can listen to what you are in the mood for without something out of the blue coming on."
"February 28, 2013","As always, Pandora is my choice of what I want to listen to in music. I am able to choose good Jazz, Big Band music which is almost impossible to find on ordinary music stations. Thanks for providing this choice."
"March 14, 2014","Maybe I'm a little basis since this is the first internet radio I have used. I have tried the others and always return to Pandora. The app is very easy to use and well polished. You can even continue to enjoy the music after leaving the app.  Pandora now had an alarm that can wake you by playing your favorite stations. If you never tried Pandora before I definitely suggest you give it a try."
"May 2, 2015","When it is possible to log on it is FANTASTIC. However eight times out of ten, the app &#34;is having technical difficulties&#34; or won't recognize the correct log in information. There is no mechanism to inform Pandora either via the app nor on the direct web site. I even contacted Amazon about the issue and there has been no impact at all. I would give it five stars if I could get in."
"January 23, 2014","I should have known, Pandora is not available in asia. The app probably works great.....elsewhere..... or with a U.S.VPN. Sorry to disapoint you my fellow expats."
"June 12, 2017","I love it. I no longer have to listen to music that I am not a fan of."
"March 28, 2016","Pandora stays on for approximately 5mins . Device has to be turned off and on again and the same thing happens"
"April 3, 2016","I love that i can have this app on my computer and on each of my devises and it will sync with all of them so all of my music is right where i put it. Pandora allows you to listen to music for free, with commercials. I wish that i could choose what song i wanted to listen to but that is OK. You are allowed so many song skips per hour of listening. I love that there are multiple stations that i can choose from. If you want to you can upgrade to Pandora monthly service for just 4.99 which isn't a bad price if you listen to it a lot and don't want the commercials and you want more skips. all in all this is a great app for music lovers"
"January 27, 2015","When I create my own stations with a variety of music styles, Pandora does not shuffle the music well. That is to say I will get several songs in a row of one variety, followed by several song in a row of another variety, rather than having them interspersedredseriescard@servivanhoeestates.link"
"June 8, 2015","good"
"June 15, 2014","I dont loke this app, because in the very first moment i opened it. A message pooped up saying 'Your country is not supported' or some poop like that. Then why the duck cant i use it without all that country supporting crap? No matter in what country im i can find every song or artist. Duck this app."
"May 22, 2017","Love this play it all the time I have many stations"
"September 14, 2013","Seriously, I get 40 hours a month ""free""... A FARKING MONTH???  Total BS IMO. No, there's no problem with the $3 monthly charge on the 'pay"" side of the house but calling your supremely limited 'ad supported' ""FREE"" makes Pandora the ""Free Credit Report.Com"" liars of the app set."
"December 3, 2012","I downloaded iheart radio instead which is free too. Pandora is nothing but annoying ads in your face saying to buy a subscription to get this off blah blah blah Deleted it instead and got a better application."
"January 22, 2013","My husband has Sirius and even that cannot compete with choosing your own favorites on Pandora. I could do without the ads, but I understand that is the ""price"" of no charge. Definitely recommend it."
"September 23, 2013","to be honest, I don't even want to give this app one star!! Pandora used to be my favorite music app but now you only get a few hours to listen to music!!! Also if you use your 6 skips, its for every single station!! whenever I used my skips I would just go to another station and be fine.... now I cant!!! I thought an update was supposed to good, my review might say 1 star but I say ZERO"
"March 14, 2016","I don't completely have this app because I need to set up an account. Accounts for me don't work because I can't remember the passwords also so many passwords require a specific way to create a password like a upper case letter and a number in the password which really make s it too hard for me. This app is not worth it because of the creating an account for it."
"May 8, 2015","No lock screen controls anymore. When I navigate away from the app while songs are paused, such as using the phone or returning from the lock screen, it restarts the station does not continue playing the paused song. Very disruptive."
"March 18, 2017","use the app all the time"
"January 3, 2014","I cannot get access to it because I get tangled up in all of the passwords needed to log in. Is anything being done about making electronic gadgets more user friendly in terms of access?? There are passwords for everything! Can you take a picture of our eyes and use that for all log-ins?"
"September 7, 2014","Good: Streaming all kinds of music on your device. Plenty of variety for all tastes.  Bad: Free version will bombard you with data sucking ads. Ap is always running even when you are not using it. Can be a bit confusing to stop the ap from running."
"July 31, 2013","It doesn't open the app at all! What can I do now? I need to get this up running on here."
"August 30, 2013","I love listening to Pandora. I was hoping to be able to utilize the awesome speakers on the kindle fire hd but the application will not load. When an update comes out to fix the bugs I will change my rating to five stars"
"February 8, 2013","I love being able to pick the artists that I want to listen to. We have very few stations available and the music selection is undesirable so Pandora is a wonderful alternative to listening pleasure."
"July 15, 2016","Because of there stand on black lives matter. I give them 2. They chose to go political and I counter with a 2 star they have no place to make a political statement. There music is good but ALL LIVES MATTER."
"June 7, 2017","I love my Pandora....keeps me going on the go"
"March 8, 2013","I used to listen to Pandora at work about five years ago and shortly started paying for it so i didn't have to listen to ads anymore. I have never been happier with any other music source. As long as you have internet, this is the way to go 100% of the time. I listen to it at work, on my phone, in my car, my son has it on his Kindle Fire, It is the best thing that ever happened to Music. Not only can you choose the station you want and add whatever artist you want, you can tell it never to play a particular song again on that station by giving it a thumbs down. If you spend hours tweeking it over years you end up with at least two or more different genre stations that have ONLY songs you like. It also plays new songs that are similar to the artists you are listening to so that you can hear the new music coming out or artist you never heard of and never knew you loved. The design is very simple and easy to use on whatever media player you are using. It is just too great for words."
"October 9, 2017","Enjoyable range of music - through affirmation of the tunes I want to hear, pandora algorithms do a good job of predicting what I want to hear without me having to think about it. I use the free service, so there are commercials though"
"November 2, 2016","Music makes everything better. Thanks, Pandora!"
"July 5, 2017","This is a good app don't get wrong but with my kindle when ever I try to fix the password it isn't in my junk folder with the link 😀😈😙😤"
"December 28, 2013","When I first started using Pandora there were NO advertising. Now there's nothing but advertising throughout the whole Pandora. I hate all those damn advertising. But I have to upgrade to Pandora 1& pay 3.99 per month to not get all the advertising. Well I guess I won't be using Pandora anymore."
"December 21, 2011","I just bought a Samsung tablet and downloaded this, only to find that it doesn't work. It just sits on the blue screen that says Pandora and it doesn't have any menu options or ways to move past this screen. I uninstalled it and decided to live without it because I have enough music anyways... Disappointed!"
"May 3, 2017","I love it. I enjoy old music from the 60th , 70, 80, and 90. They are beautiful to hear nowadays."
"November 15, 2014","Not a fan. It played for about an hour then stopped and just kept asking if I wanted to upgrade for $4.99/more. I could not get the message to go away. Every time I tried to open the app, I got the upgrade message and could not get Pandora to play. I deleted the app."
"June 8, 2013","This is a great app for music lover's! You can listen to the music while doing something else at the same time. The only bad thing is that you can only skip five songs a hour and adds come endless you by membership or whatever it is called"
"January 22, 2013","I hosted a sewing party and used Pandora on my Kindle to give us some interesting background ""noise"". After 5 solid hours without pauses in service or repeated tracks, I'm a happy camper."
"February 14, 2013","The free versions' adds (especially the pop ups) are very disruptive and worse than other services I'm aware of.I'm considering the paid version but checking other services more closely first."
"July 8, 2015","just fine.ad's are annoying but don't interfere with listening."
"December 29, 2015","Thanks the product is working fine on my new Amazon tablet"
"November 20, 2016","Love Pandora. It is able to learn my music taste very quickly"
"July 14, 2016","It can't get any better than Pandora Music you can pick the songs you like best Other than songs you don't want to hear thumbs up for Pandora!!!!"
"March 2, 2017","So needed keeping my high on tunes"
"January 25, 2013","I don't understand how it works. I can choose an artist and after one song it switches to another artist. Also, it shuts off in the middle of the next song. Pandora George Jones or Tom Jones"
"January 4, 2014","I've actually had Pandora for years. It's the place I can go to when I want to listen to the music I like to hear (gospel). I can choose who and what I like and Pandora will add the same type of music to my choices; if I like it I can keep it, and if not I can just give it a thumbs down and I won't have to hear it anymore. I happen to like my Pandora commercial-free, so I pay a small yearly fee for that luxury, but if you don't mind the commercials, you don't have to pay anything to enjoy your kind of music."
"June 2, 2017","Incessant and loud ads. You cannot stop or pause an ad. Horrible!"
"April 17, 2017","I have installed but do not use."
"November 11, 2013","When I first signed up for Pandora it was just fine. I was rating songs and artists listening to the music. About a week later I tapped on the Pandora icon and it didn't respond. I downloaded Pandora but I keep getting the error message saying that they are having technical difficulties."
"October 3, 2017","Good"
"March 17, 2017","I don';t even know why this is showing up for me to comment. I never purchased it"
"May 28, 2014","Having known about Pandora since it's inception I am wondering now why I waited so long to install it on my phone. It is absolutely a wonderful way to listen to your favorites but, more importantly, discover some new ones."
"January 13, 2013","Friday time after I registered Pandora It rejected my email and password. After a lot of times 're-downloading .It still didn't work. So please don't get the app . I know it is a popular choice of radio like apps."
"August 31, 2016","I do not like this app. There are a lot better out on the market. I prefer Apple Music. Just my preference. Too many commercials and slow to load. Use a different one app is my suggestion."
"November 5, 2016","Love Pandora music..."
"January 6, 2014","I think this app is really great especially on kindle cause you can't download music. I really think we should have more apps like this!!!"
"May 21, 2017","Really enjoy music to a new level."
"June 13, 2017","Excellent product works great"
"November 12, 2015","I can't figure out if the problem is Pandora or my Kindle Fire as the sound plays occasionally and never when I want. Pandora runs great on my Android phone, Mac and Windows PC so this is quite disappointing."
"August 26, 2017","who needs this...not me !!!!"
"December 3, 2012","This newer version of pandora sucks. All it does is keeps playing song that I tell it no to. And it also keeps dorping out. It is terrible. Wish I had never updateed the older one that I had."
"January 22, 2013","This is an awesome app. I enjoy my own music all day at work and can change it up a bit when I want to. I would highly recommend this app. Pandora is awesome. Have in my truck also."
"May 26, 2017","love it listen all the time"
"February 23, 2013","I love Pandora but whenever I wanna listen to a song it never plays the song. It would be better if I could skip more than 6 song every hour on 1 station. Other than that it's good"
"March 9, 2016","Okay, so I wanted Pandora paid for a while, but discovered that it really wasn't worth $60 a year for me and discontinued. Imagine my dismay to find months later a charge feom Pandora. What's going on here?"
"November 11, 2015","Good idea, good app, decent music BUT:  1. You can't pick EXACTLY what artist or song you want to listen to. You pick the genre and HOPE it comes on... 2. There are annoying ads all over the place...not only in the bottom but you also have to skip to none skippable ads too. 3. You can't skip songs more than 6 times per stations."
"April 29, 2017","doesn't work on kindle fire"
"August 17, 2017","Use it to look for what is new"
"December 14, 2012","The app constantly stops playing music. It will play a few songs and stop, usually when an ad pops up. You can purchase the ad free app though, but I haven't so not sure how well that works. I have talked to several others and they have had this same problem with the Pandora app. Not enjoyable"
"July 28, 2016","Love this app I use it all the time"
"May 2, 2016","could not figure it out to use the right way"
"April 19, 2017","Sounds like...it doesn't work."
"April 19, 2016","In the first place, I NEVER ordered this app. I have no idea why it shows as being ordered by me, because I never do social media. The only redeeming thing about this whole episode is that it didn't cost me anything. I guess I'm going to have to find out who has hacked my account, and take whatever violent action may be necessary."
"July 28, 2016","Only problem is I cannot access on my kindle fire"
"August 6, 2015","I loved this app at first but now I HATE it I was just wanting to listen to music so I went on it and it started skipping song and then I shut my kindle all the way off and I turned it on again and it said &#34;Were sorry but we have no more music for you try turning to another station.&#34; So I did and it said the same thing please fix!"
"August 21, 2013","After looking at all the good reviews for this app, I decided to get it. Unfortunately, it wouldn't work on my Kindle Fire HD. It just stayed on the blue Pandora screen. Any way to fix this and I will buy it again."
"November 19, 2013","I have herd that you can listen to any music on this app but mine wont work for me. I have a kindle and an iPod and on both it wont work. On my kindle fire it worked but when i wanted to change the song my whole kindle crashed. On my iPod i cant create or log in to my account."
"February 18, 2015","It will play a song of two, then go quiet for five to ten minutes. Then it will play a commercial, then start over again. It's very agitating. I tried to contract Pandora to fix the problem and never got a response. I've uninstalled it, the reinstalled it; it didn't work."
"April 12, 2013","So Pandora did an update and they can now access my contacts and send them emails without my permission. I loved Pandora but I will not risk them sending stuff to my many contacts especially since a lot if them are professional contacts. Goodbye Pandora. Looking for something else now."
"March 2, 2013","I love using Pandora. It is easy to set up. It is easy to customize. The more you use it... the thumbs up/thumbs down, skip... the better it makes your music selections."
"August 10, 2013","This could be a good app but when you buy the add free version; anything but add free. Contacted customer support and they can't fix it. Bought this once just to cancel due to all the adds. Bought again to see if fixed and nope. Adds galore. Just stick with the free version."
"December 5, 2015","There is a major issue causing the tracks to skip through the entire song in a matter of seconds. A song will start, and it'll jitter thirty seconds ahead every second until the song &#34;ends&#34; and it'll continue with the issue through every song that follows. I don't know the cause of this, but I hope someone fixes this."
"February 9, 2014","Pandora must be in the habit of spoofing reviews of itself. I never signed up for this, never created an acount, have never and will never, ever use it, and do not wish to be included with anyone who thinks Pandora is anything worth having. I am ready to sever all ties with Amazon if Pandora comes along with it. BUYER BEWARE,!!"
"January 3, 2017","Pandora is awesome. I love it. Even better is the fact it doesn't eat battery up on my cellphone."
"June 24, 2017","Wouldn't sign on and work  Don't know if it's Pandora or my Kindle Fire."
"March 25, 2013","I tried to sign in and it kept saying it didn't find my e-mail adderss or password so I can'nt use it. so wants the point in having PANDORA if you can'nt use it?"
"August 30, 2013","This was my favorite app until the latest update. Now it won't even start on my Kindle and if it does, it locks up after just a few songs or if I change the channel. I am a paying customer and deserve to have what I pay for. Can't even figure out how to stop my subscription."
"March 2, 2014","Pretty good music selection as others have noted. My concerns are operational controls that are weak or lacking on my Nexus 7.1 Android tablet. When going to sleep there is no sleep timer since the last update, it was removed for Android tablets. Please bring it back. The big reason I miss the sleep timer is because when I am drowsey and want to turn Pandora off I have to almost wake up because of no quick way to shut Pandora off. It requires a bunch of taps to turn off. Where oh where is my sleep timer for my android tablet????"
"September 18, 2017","Great music app"
"April 26, 2017","I love Pandora sometimes it plays some of my fav songs and new songs that I like!it even helps me relax or go to sleep!I love Pandora.Creators of Pandora,if you see my comment thank you thank you thank you so so much!I think EVERYONE that loves music should have this ad.also Pandora take out the bad words music.Thx!"
"January 1, 2013","I Got this programfrom nt computer on Sunday night and as Tues night I have yet to see it on my Kindle, I like it on my computer just did not think that it would take so long to down load."
"November 11, 2012","It puts music to my ears . I just make a playlist & they put the songs I really want to hear !. The music in high quilaty . It doesnt have to much commerical , it has few not alot . But the music is cool . You dont have to waste your time to serach a song just put the author in & youll get it ^.^ This is a gnarly,awesome, app :D (y)"
"March 29, 2016","Love it"
"October 22, 2013","True. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I'm using a kindle fire hd. When it does work it's great and performs top notch. When it doesn't it sits at the intro screen and when you try to 're open it, it flashes and closes. Is this a bug? If yes, then needs an update."
"March 20, 2017","Good product!"
"March 18, 2017","Love Pandora!"
"June 20, 2013","I live in New Hampshire and the reception is spotty, at best. The songs are constantly breaking up. Not the top notch service I thought it would be. In addition, when the app needs to be upgraded, it requests that I register again and select a different user name and password."
"December 1, 2012","I have listened to Pandora for the past few years and love it. Installing it on my Kindle Fire 2 and being able to listen to music in the background while using the Kindle for the web and other features is right up my alley. Also, I have been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sound. It's great for this device. Highly recommend."
"March 6, 2017","sucks"
"July 31, 2015","I have not use it to much yet but when I have I have enjoyed the music. I'm able to bring up the music I want quickly and easily. I really like the quality of the sound of the music, a lot of the time my Kindle is too soft . I have to use earbuds or a plug in speaker to hear U Tube and some other music I've downloaded. Pandora plays nice and loud .enough through the Kindle. I do hate having to use a password to sign in, it's on MY Kindle which is open I don't see the need of a password."
"December 28, 2015","New Fire HD, latest op-sys upgrades, loaded Pandora App. It recognizes my account, loads my stations, but will not play. It will advance to next song, change stations, everything except play. Nice."
"July 18, 2016","Too many ads, ads are too long, and I wish I had the ability to opt out of live performances. Hearing people scream ""WOOO"" the entire song isn't exactly pleasurable."
"March 21, 2017","The app itself is ok, but Pandora is getting a little long in the tooth. The constant commercials, the extremely lacking selection, and constant repeats are getting annoying. Back in the day I used Pandora to find new bands, but lately they've been getting stagnant (and redundant). It seems they're going for ""hits"" instead of music that doesn't get played on the Top40.   I've moved on to Spotify for the most part, but once in a while will come back to see if they've added anything I like. However, even after a few hours it's still the same songs (not just bands) that played the last time I listened to it. There's hardly any variety with songs and/or bands anymore.  Maybe this is a side effect of using the free (or mobile) version; or maybe they just have a very limited selection for specific bands, but it doesn't compel me to buy into it; there's plenty of other options."
"December 17, 2012","Yes, I know, that's how they pay for things. But come on, commercials every third song or so? Wow. I remember using Pandora years ago on my computer - it wasn't that bad."
"October 12, 2017","It's okay"
"January 6, 2017","used to pay liked it a lot. money got tight drop it to free WOW so many commercials. was gifted a fire tablet get amazon free music NO commercials love!!!"
"December 22, 2013","Works wonderfully. I love choosing my music styles. I'm playing R&B and Pop holiday music at work. I have cancelled XM."
"January 21, 2014","After one song it stops playing. This is very annoying when I'm doing my hair or anything else were I have to walk away from my kindle. Even after I change my awake time to 15 minutes it still stops after one song until I unlock my kindle. Please get this fixed"
"January 3, 2014","I tried playing music with this app, using my Pandora One acct. As soon as the screen goes black the app stooped working.... so I have to the screen active I order to listen to my music? I can listen to it on my phone and it doesn't do that. Very disappointed."
"March 3, 2016","For the past 3 days the app will open but the music won't play and I can't do anything like try to pause and unpause it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still won't work! What can you do about this? The bar at the bottom that says how long the song lasts and how much of it has played just says 00:00 out of 00:00"
"May 25, 2013","it used to be better when you didn't have a certain ammount of time a month to listen. you only get forty free hours. its not the best any more :/ disappointing."
"December 19, 2012","I really like this app. I was able to cancel my Sirius subscription and save money. I use it on my smartphone in my car and in my home. At home, I connect to a bluetooth speaker. When a call comes in, the music is silenced until I finish the call and then it automatically starts playing music again. Unlimited music selection."
"December 12, 2016","I am getting tired of the newest version opening up no matter what I don't want. I exited out of it 5 x yesterday. After I quit. I may have to delete."
"October 24, 2014","great buy will buy again if needed"
"September 14, 2015","I would really love more skips. So would all of my friends. Less adds of course,the usual complaint. A replay or repeat button, which I think half of the internet would like. I would really like to be Abel to make a collection of songs to just put on repeat. If there is one pls tell me. I've looked everywhere."
"June 25, 2016","The reason that I am not giving five stars is that Pandora is restricted to some people in some other countrys. This is a music Media not a political establishemnt."
"February 23, 2013","Was sent an intro by my Sister. Signed up for free trial. Awesome tracks. Brings back the old days.May consider the monthly subscription somtime in the future."
"December 3, 2013","Would not work, removed it from my device. Found another app covering blues and jazz which is 80% of what I listen to."
"May 5, 2016","It used to be nice when it was 30 dollars for a year of premium. But now a price increase, more ads and commercials with the basic make this not worth loading at all."
"September 4, 2014","There is a great selection of music. Only bad thing about it is there is no way to like or dislike a song when the phone is in locked mode. If there is a way to like/dislike a song while phone is in locked mode, then it will be superb."
"September 6, 2015","I love it you get free music but there's only one thing i hate you need Wi-Fi it drives me crazy because at my house we dont got Wi-Fi but on the way to school i use the Wi-Fi my bus driver has but any way great app it has all the music u ask for get it its great"
"February 8, 2013","I love the variety of music and I am really enjoying all of it from motown to relaxation music!!! I average listening to Pandora about 4 hours a day."
"June 24, 2017","Works well"
"March 3, 2017","Grandson loves this game."
"November 2, 2017","Ok"
"January 18, 2017","I love Pandora...use it on computer at home and work....as well as my phone. It is the best. I am always at my ""100"" stations allowed because with just a couple of exceptions, I like all music from the 1940's - present. LOVE IT"
"June 14, 2014","Collect app!You get to pick your own radio station based on what you listen to,listen to music related to what your radio station is about,and just jam to the music all day!!=) =)I would definitely approve this app for 5 stars!! :) :) =) =)"
"March 26, 2014","On my Kindle Fire when I try to log in, the app tells me, ""We are experiencing unexpected technical difficulties."" I believed it the first time but it's been two weeks and I still get this error. That is not unexpected any more, is it?"
"June 6, 2017","great"
"January 6, 2014","The addition of an alarm clock is a nice feature, but it's not working on my locked device. I woke up and discovered the screensaver on and burning up the battery, but no music until I entered my password. Maybe there is a workaround? Hopefully would not require yet another Android permission. How much personal data do you guys need to collect? I'm sure ad revenue and paid versions generate considerable profit. We know the musicians are not being compensated appropriately. As far as the app's overall consistency I will say that things run smooth and it is enjoyable to hear mainstream &#34;radio&#34; hits from time to time. One thing I liked about the old Yahoo Music Jukebox (an earlier platform of audio streaming Pandora seems to have modeled itself on) was having the opportunity to hear much deeper tracks from artists I never knew about."
"September 6, 2014","good for listening to music"
"July 26, 2016","What could be better? You can have it on multiple devices where ever you go. My favorite thing about it is that if you enter a statement nag or group, it can introduce you to new music."
"April 17, 2013","This app used to be better , meaning more music less ads but after a revamp has now more ads than you care for but still come back time and time again for . The selection of available artists and other tuning / set up features with in PANDORA are amazing and what truly makes it a lil' better than most of it's competitors ."
"February 12, 2013","Pandora is one of the best apps I have.On Pandora you can choose you favorite artists or song plus and other artists and other song's related to it."
"August 17, 2017","Good"
"June 2, 2016","So many ads, so little music. Also, the ad is displayed and in your way all the time. I thought about paying for the service but the price jumped up way too high."
"January 20, 2013","Great program. So easy to use and no download time. I can get almost any music I desire and have the music playing in the background while I'm working."
"August 31, 2013","this definitely has every song on it that you can possibly think of... except for dave chappell which sucks. i listen to it all day at work, but be prepared for it to almost immediately drain the battery of any device that you are using to listen to it."
"February 6, 2013","I purchased this app so I could listen to free music. But I can't find it or figure out how to download it. Reply. Ok. Your tech guy helped. Thanks."
"January 8, 2013","I couldnt even install this app to my kindle... perhaps it isnt for the kindle but for a phone because everytime it begins to install my kindle cuts on and off until finally my battery is dead! Now i cant even turn it on i am SEVERELY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS!!!"
"January 22, 2013","I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THE VARIETY OF MUSIC YOU CAN GET FROM PANDORA. USE IT AT WORK ALL THE TIME AND MANY PEOPLE STATE THAT THEY REALLY LIKE THE MUSIC!"
"February 8, 2013","Allows me to listen to a diverse selection of music whether I am in a happy, laid back or sade mood. There is always something for everyone to hear."
"November 18, 2015","This app is great it is confusing and fun at the same time but great I figured it out from this 😣😣😤😤😈😈😬😬😠😠😢😢😴😴 to this 😇😇😇😂😂😆😆😂😁😊😁😁😀☺😉😃😄😅"
"September 1, 2013","I was unable to do anything with it. I downloaded it and could not open it to use. I would not recommend it to anyone."
"September 28, 2016","This is the most convenient and easiest interface music app out there. There is a reason this app is at top of the app store"
"April 19, 2014","Without equal! It would take days to put together the great selection that Pandora does. It's difficult to stop once you start listening with hit after hit that's keep rolling on. The best and most enjoyable app I've downloaded by far!"
"November 13, 2012","When I try to install this app on a tablet it fails saying I already own the app but I don't since it won't install! It works OK on a Mini PC TV stick but they have really annoying ads about gun background checks you can't skip though. Best to skip this app."
"February 8, 2013","Love this Pandora Media it is great It has all the old school sounds that I enjoy. Everyone needs to listen to your favorite tunes with Pandora."
"January 23, 2016","I love Pandora. It works very well on my Motorola DROID phone. It works somewhat less well in my Volvo car in that there is a long delay before the first track plays and a rather lengthy delay between each subsequent track. Also, often, Pandora in the Volvo will repeat tracks which is very annoying. But, I love being able to access my favorite styles of music for free and stream them for hours on end. I also like how I am able to listen to different takes by artists than those that are generally played on the radio. And, there are a number of live tracks that are played. It's all good stuff!"
"October 11, 2015","Terrible selections - very limited, unless you only follow easy listening or mainstream for the masses. Classical very limited. I searched ? Madrigals and Renaissance and Early music and came up with rock bands with those words in their names. Just mass junk, really and won't recommend to a music connisseur."
"July 26, 2016","I listen to Pandora on our smart TV and love it. I assumed I would like heaing music on my computer as well but I found the music distracts me for my activity. That's why I only gave it three stars. For a lot of people, this would not be problem and in that case it deserves five stars."
"September 17, 2012","It started out really good but then it took a turn for the worst, it crashed multipule times. It stops in the middle of my songs and then their are ads after every song and the last almost as long as the songs. total waste of time. ive gone to slacker now."
"February 23, 2013","Love having access to my favorite kinds of music whnever I want. I can take to Kindle with me wherever I go and listen to my favorite music."
"June 8, 2016","great"
"January 29, 2016","I loved Pandora, but lately it hasn't been playing properly. I'll pick a station and it'll work, eventually, but as soon as I change stations it won't play anything. I've had this problem on multiple Android phones and my Kindle Fire tablet. I will be uninstalling this app and going to IHeartRadio."
"February 8, 2013","I enjoy being able to select the multiple musical categories for my listening pleasure, and will often listen to pandora as I do other things."
"June 14, 2017","Disappointed on the difficulty to obtain password. I have Pandora on my phone and find it enjoyable;however what a pain to get it hooked up on the Kindle Fire"
"February 22, 2013","this has many types of music to listen to and is fairly easy to use. i am only an occasional listener so the free program was right for me."
"December 21, 2013","Works just fine and is nice to have music we want when we want it. Should have done this sooner."
"December 22, 2013","I agree with a lot of the users here. It just freezes up now an all I get is a pretty little blue screen that says Pandora!!! I have eve deleted the app an downloaded it again and STILL the SAME THING. So it will stay at one star for me."
"July 19, 2017","I couldn't download Pandora. I like I Heart Radio better, anyway."
"February 21, 2016","Stops playing randomly. Support is terrible"
"April 28, 2017","love it"
"August 16, 2017","love it!!! Easy to use and offers a wide variety of music etc."
"October 27, 2016","I love pandora. I listen to it everywhere even in my office"
"December 22, 2013","At registration site message informed me my password was incorrect. I was directed to ""pandora help site which Prompted a ""phissing site warning. I deleted app at that point."
"September 28, 2013","It caused my kindle to be almost unusable I have had to Evan get another one DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!! It toke me forever to find out it was the problem so please if you don't want your kindle crashing DON'T GET IT PLEASE. ITS TERABLE"
"April 18, 2017","DON'T USE IT MUCH"
"February 8, 2013","Good app even with the music. Also you don't PAY money for the music but I loved it especial y with the choice and creating radio stations"
"July 23, 2016","Pandora has decided to go political as a entity and I not only do not agree with their position but have no use for the involvement in their protest or support of Black Lives Matter. For those unaware, BLM is calling the murderer of the five police officers in Dallas, TX a martyr."
"May 27, 2014","Why does it need permission to do or change just about everything on my phone? Cut some of the unnecessary permissions and I'll use you again!"
"March 2, 2017","I don't have access to unlimited internet"
"September 10, 2014","Not for me"
"March 4, 2013","It doesn't work where I live and that's really unfair. How does my location matter? Please change this because I really want this app"
"September 2, 2016","Way too many ads and takes up a ton of data... download the songs and save them on your phone and play them from a media player instead"
"December 27, 2015","I hate the commercials and how your skips and thumbs down are limited."
"April 6, 2013","My problem with Pandora was that I wanted specific artists. Pandora only offers a specific genre. Not what I was looking for."
"March 14, 2013","I'm always listening to Pandora. I love that I can get a variety of music from pop to Broadway showtunes wherever I want. My only concern is that for free you can only listen for forty hours a month, and I would like to listen more than that"
"February 23, 2017","Egh."
"April 17, 2013","Best product EVER. If you love music, any kind of music, you must have Pandora. We have it playing every evening at dinner. Soft music, K Gee mostly, is our favorite. Southern Gospel is great and I could go on and on. GREAT...R. Hobbs"
"February 19, 2013","I love the music but when I go to up grade to NO interruptions. they want my info including credit card number on a unsecure site"
"December 16, 2012","I can't fairly write a review because I have been unable to view the Pandora website on my kindle. I am happy with the Pandora product which I use on my computer.  Have you had similar complaints from other customers?"
"October 9, 2015","Do use it much."
"January 22, 2013","Pandora is such a great station. I play it on my phone, in my car, at work! They have such a great variety of all genres of music!"
"February 8, 2013","Love it. Like the ability to listen to what I want to listen to and not what I have to listen to. Recommend to all who like music."
"January 21, 2013","The best time of my reading time is listening to Pandora while reading. I am happy to recommend Pandora to anyone who enjoys music."
"October 27, 2014","Awesome"
"January 21, 2013","great app for my favorite website. i have it on almost constantly. great for rediscovering old favorites and hearing new artists"
"January 22, 2014","I love pandora on my laptop and so wanted to get this so I could listen to it on my Android as well. They don't tell you when you download it that it will not work in Canada. Why not?! I listen to Pandora on my laptop!"
"October 12, 2013","Just downloaded this app and it will not play on my Kindle fire hd. When app is opened it sits on the pandora home screen and will not go to the stations page. Hope they fix this issue so I can listen to pandora on my Kindle."
"November 14, 2013","Easy to create stations. Great music. Use account on touch for my 2 year old, my old phone for my 4 year old, and My phone or iPad for myself. All with one account. Children sleep to classical music and don't get woken up by cars or other outside noises (owls were freaking my daughter out)"
"February 22, 2013","I have not tried the this not yet, still learning about what this tablet does, compared with working with my larger computer."
"January 23, 2013","Love this. Easy to use, great variety, AWESOME tunes. Good job : ) I enjoy it very much. Wish I had better speakers though ...."
"February 8, 2013","Just the songs I like and all the other selection albums I have. Like the feature that you can judge whether you like or not"
"November 22, 2013","Pandora is a really cost effective way to listen to the music that fits your tastes. It's a very effective tool to broaden your music horizons as well because the very intuitive music-selection system leads you into other songs and artists that you may not have known or appreciated otherwise. It's a very good way to reflect your musical preferences without becoming too tunnel-visioned in your musical tastes."
"June 8, 2016","Of all the internet radio, Pandora is my favorite. Easy to use, easy to get it to play songs similar to the one you want them to be similar to. Good variety when you want it. Unfortunately, more and more commercials, wish it was commercial free like the good ol days."
"August 7, 2015","This is a perfectly fine app when it works, but there was some weird update to Kindle's that make it impossible to watch youtube videos and now Pandora is going haywire and skipping around all crazy. GET IT FIXED!"
"November 17, 2013","Before the most recent updates I loved Pandora. Now Pandora is super slow and takes at least 5 minutes to load. Compared to Iheart Radio which takes about 10 seconds. Until the next update I will be using Iheart Radio."
"June 13, 2017","Love the way you can choose exactly what music you want to listen to."
"October 23, 2016","This is awsome good but I keeps saying app not owed what's that about"
"July 4, 2013","You should get this if you don't want to buy music. The only problem I have with this is that you need to have internet to use it so you can't us it when ever. but it is a really great app I love to use it when ever I can."
"January 23, 2013","I like the music selection. The only down side it that it appears to play the same songs each time you put in an artist."
"January 22, 2013","I love the music selections and ease to use. One bonus is being able to listen to the stations on a variety of counters."
"February 7, 2013","I have listen to this site for many years and love having it on my Kindle! having my stations with me simple priceless!"
"December 29, 2012","I can't find it on my kindle. When I purchased things they are hard to locate. I think I would like it if I could find it."
"February 28, 2013","Let's me make stations that fit my tastes. It is relatively easy to use, and build on your preferences. Great app!"
"February 6, 2016","I am new to doing downloads like this on my Kindle. A friend did it for me and I am so happy with it. I can listen to a variety of songs and genres in peace and quiet whereever I am. Way to go Pandora."
"February 24, 2013","I just brought my kindle and i love tuning in to pandora for all the greastest hits. I'm giving this 2thumbs up :)"
"March 2, 2013","I love the blues station Pandora put together for me. Haven't heard a song I didn't like yet. Awesome! Thank you."
"February 23, 2013","Free access to whatever music you choose. easy to set up. Allowed to build multiple stations based on your mood."
"April 17, 2014","Love that I can plug in an artist or song and then hear back a ton of music--some new to me, some old favs I forgot. I like exploring and hearing different types of music and Pandora makes that easy"
"April 17, 2012","I've always loved Pandora. I have an account in my PC, however t this app is non stop issues. I can't get through a song without it force closing on me. Before all the updates it worked great. I can't stand it now. I'd be happy to use it again if they could fix it."
"January 20, 2013","Pandora app works great and easy to use. Not much else it downloads easy. Pandora is a good site easy to use also"
"January 22, 2013","I just got tuned into Pandora & love the Country Classis, relieves the tension in my shoulders, love every song."
"July 4, 2016","I have a Pandora account. Downloaded the app and expected it to work. Have yet to get it to work on my Kindle Fire"
"September 18, 2017","I have enjoyed listening to music that I really enjoy."
"October 2, 2016","There are commercials unless you pay for it (I do) but $4/month does not seem that high. (I believe Spotify is the only other major streaming service at the moment. ) Wish you could pick out specific songs to play or make up specific play lists."
"September 28, 2016","Good music selection."
"January 22, 2013","It is a great product.Enjoy the music that you can take any place and can only have the music that you like."
"January 21, 2013","Pandora is great. I use it whenever possible for my favorites. And on my Kindle Fire it is always with me."
"March 14, 2013","It's good. However, I don't like how you can only skip x amount of songs per hour and how the x to exit the ads isbso small. It makes driving very unsafe."
"November 1, 2016","I love that I can choose the music and have choices along the way as I listen. I like that there are other suggested musicians as I have found a couple I love and had not heard of before."
"June 24, 2017","I love it."
"December 28, 2013","You listen and it stops working every 10 secs to 60 secs. Then tries to reboot and it starts another playlist. Bad kitty! Bad!"
"June 6, 2017","The selection of music is very wide. I enjoy the thumbprint station as well."
"December 20, 2013","The App appeared to download and it launched but would not work or give me any options for getting music or adding any stations."
"October 17, 2013","I downloaded the app for kindle fire hd and when I opened it it just stays on the opening screen. I would give it a higher rating, but until this bug is worked out I have to use another music player."
"April 18, 2017","Lovely"
"January 21, 2013","Love how the station learns what you like to hear and evolves along with your taste in music. It rocks!"
"January 9, 2017","I like being able to listen to artist of the same genre. It's also a good way to discover new artist as well."
"May 15, 2013","I only like listening to the music as i play my games, but i don't like when they only give 40hrs per month.I think it should be more time given."
"February 26, 2017","Ever heard of Spotify?😏"
"January 12, 2012","Just like Netflix, they had to get greedy. sucks now. i won't update my iphone app. But, its too late for my tablet. Screw this crap!"
"April 19, 2013","It works fine but the style of songs are based on genre or poularity, not on sound. It gets annoying with all the adds and there is no point in a skip limit! Doesn't adhere well to your music taste at all."
"February 19, 2013","what can I say?! Pandora is the best and the app is very good too. Easy to install, easy to follow"
"January 21, 2013","i started using this app some time ago told my wife about it she loves it, she use it when she walks."
"June 29, 2013","If you are a music lover then I highly recommend this app. It is free! Name any type of music and you will find it on Pandora. It's practically like a radio station but if you don't like the song, you can skip it. Beware, you are limiting to only 6 skips per hour."
"February 14, 2015","This thing sucks . You look up the song you want to and then it comes up . So then u tap the album and it comes up with 100 different songs that are like the song you want to listen to but it never lets you listen to the specific song that you are looking for"
"February 23, 2013","I love that I can get my music anywhere. Look up what I want and there it is . A lot of variety"
"August 27, 2016","I was disappointed that when I asked for a single artist I still got a mix. Over all it is great....very few commercials."
"April 17, 2017","I enjoy the convenience of having my stations listed and the music I like."
"December 5, 2013","This app will not work on my kindle fire hd I tried installed and reinstalled no help it won't play it stays on the blue screen and its not my internet because everything else works perfect"
"January 22, 2013","Because I was able to choose my own radio stations and songs that I can listen to wherever I go"
"June 10, 2013","I just got back on Pandora today and I tried to change the song and it wouldn't let me.and before you could change it 6 times.that sucks"
"February 28, 2013","I chose 5 stars because you can literally look up any and I mean any type of music on this!"
"October 28, 2013","Pandora music is wonderful, Pandora for free was just okay, but eventually became unaccessible. The ads pop up too often. Also, have to exit and reenter to continue to use it. Then one day, it just said it was unavailable, so I have deleted it from my Kindle."
"December 20, 2013","Pandora is just one of those apps that I require be available on my digital devices. If it's connected to the internet, it better have Pandora available. Sure, it's just random music playback, but I love random music playback! It's how I discover new music :)"
"October 30, 2013","Had I known Pandora really knew all my favorite songs I would have started listening to it a long time ago! Thanks Kindle"
"December 4, 2012","I don't listen to local radio because of all the talking and commercials. I've liked Pandora online so I thought I'd try the app. EVERY three songs there is a video commercial and there are constant pop-up ads. Thanks, but no thanks. Uninstalled it."
"February 7, 2013","I love pandora. I have it on my TV. So it was only natural to have the app on my tablet too."
"November 20, 2012","It's the same thing as the original computer version of Pandora. I still rate it a 4 instead of a 5 because I hate all the ads. Oh well."
"September 22, 2017","love it"
"March 15, 2013","the choice is amazing and plays without a glitch. I wish it was offered in dubai also, perhaps the local ISP has blocked it and not pandora.  It is the best where ever is it available."
"April 26, 2016","We give it a MILLION stars! We get every kind of music we would like to hear, weather it be Rock and Roll, Jazz, Hard Rock, Country or any other. It is amazing and we are thrilled to have it in our home! THANK YOU!"
"February 1, 2014","IT DON'T EVEN TAKE YOUR BIRTH DATE IT IS A STUPID APP AND A WAST OF TIME.  IT IS SO STUPID A RETARDED"
"June 5, 2013","This app isn't the greatest only points you towards different stations not a app that you can listen to a particular song. If I want to listen to a station I can turn on the radio. The search browser is crappie to. Wouldn't recommend this to friends."
"July 30, 2013","I LOVE Pandora. It gives me every kind of music that I love and does a great shuffle, once you put in enough ""likes"""
"October 30, 2013","Could not get this to work on my Kindle. I gave up there were a few other applications that did not work as well."
"September 12, 2017","At times it is hard to turn Off. Other than that it is good."
"November 6, 2013","Pandora should be able to simply list albums and/or songs by an artist - not simply try to make suggestions based on entered information. If I want to populate a ""station"" only with songs of a particular artist, I should be able to do so...."
"January 17, 2017","I am really enjoying using Pandora. I like being able to personalize it so I really enjoy the music it plays. I also like that I don't have to get up and change a CD or anything. It just plays till I turn it off."
"August 1, 2017","Awesome music."
"April 17, 2013","I cannot imagine my work day without Pandora. Also a little Pandora while on the riding mower helps make the chore go by quicker. Since I introduced pandora to my teen children the amount of digital music they have purchased has almost stopped!"
"August 11, 2016","Didn't download. .. said it wasn't available at the time.. major disappointment."
"July 29, 2016","I tried several times to download Pandora and I got a message to try again later."
"December 23, 2013","I'm not a frequent music listener, yet I thought ""Why not?"" and tried it out. I am very happy with my selection. The program is very good and well designed. I appreciate the program and suggest you download the program to your tablet or computer."
"January 19, 2013","I love it me encanta puedo escuchar musica variada de la misma categoria, darles like o unlike y guarda lo q me gusta y lo q no"
"February 21, 2014","yay! , music that you don't want to listen to is playing and you can't skip, because their agreement's don't allow it.. get an ipod or mp3 player and forget this app"
"January 20, 2013","It's a great product--love my music! Easy to use, even for this grandma! Nice that it plays while I do other things on my Kindle."
"November 29, 2014","DO NOT LIKE THIS; HAVE TRIED TO REGISTER AND IT SAYS I AM USING WRONG EMAIL ACCOUNT, EVEN THOUGH GOOGLE SAID I COULD NOT USE MY STANDARD EMAIL"

"December 26, 2013","Android apps are being shared by logging into Amazon to access FREE APPS!!!! WHY!!!! Most of the time app crashes because Amazon won't load when using mobile service."
"August 27, 2013","This was a free app and I do not use it. It came with a phone I bought last year. This comment is just being made to clear this off my ""to do"" list here at amazon."
"May 4, 2014","Ok, I absolutely love this app, I mean I don't have Pandora1 and I still love it, minimum ads, free music, AND comedian stations. There is just one suggestion I have, and I'm sure others will agree. All the time I accidentally hit the ""like"" or ""dislike"" button, and you can't undo it unless you change it to the other. My suggestion is that we are able to unclick the ""like"" and ""dislike"" button, but other than that it's great."
"January 22, 2013","When you create an account u type in a artist u like (ex:justin bieber) it will pull up justin bieber radio AWESOME!!!! <3"
"December 9, 2012","can someone help me...I downloaded pandora but can't find the app on my kindle fire vs to listen? I am a new kindle user - thanks"
"November 27, 2016","I really like Pandora because it always has the music I want to listen to and it is so well made that navigation is extremely easy"
"March 3, 2016","It wakes me up to the sound of beautiful Christian music every day. What a great start for strengthening my faith. I really appreciate the faith filled variety of inspirational sound."
"June 25, 2013","I am not going to share my email password with Pandora and I did not see a way to get by that screen. At that point I just shut it down and probably will not go back to it."
"October 14, 2015","I absolutely love it! I don't remember the last time I used my i-pod. It is marvelous. All the music I could ever hope to have at the touch of an app! Love it, love it, love it!"
"January 30, 2017","Didnt get to get it started tried to in the past as well and it would not open to let me listen on my phone two years ago now I couldnt on my tablet device so Im not interested right now."
"December 30, 2015","This game is NOT free!!! Write when you get to the actual app, you have to log in your email and all that stuff, then you have to pay! It's not fair!!! If this game isn't actually free, then they need to just say so!!"
"December 21, 2014","I just downloaded this app for my kindle, thinking I could sync it with my other account. Low and behold....I can't even get past the opening screen without being told my session has timed out. If I could give it no stars I would."
"June 23, 2016","I ordered 2 charms from this seller and both looked ""worn"" for lack of a better word. There was very little detail. Not happy and will only buy from a jewelry store from now on. Total waste of money."
"November 27, 2012","Stops playing,""are you still there?"".They want to keep control of you at all times,then try selling you upgrade.Music Choice is my choice.Commercial and spam free.Chas"
"April 2, 2013","Wouldn't load so I deleted it and downloaded it again. When it loaded it said I have to log in with FB. I don't have one so I got rid of it, but it wouldn't go back until I logged in with a fake FB and then I could get rid of it."
"February 8, 2013","This app is very easy to use. I can receive the type of music I prefer at any time. The type of music is just endless."
"January 20, 2013","This ap has been part of my daily life for over 5 years now. Love the new music I hear and instantly love on my stations."
"November 10, 2013","I love the pandora app. It runs fast and smoothly on my kindle fire HD. But every few seconds there's a ad pop up and you have to pay a certain amount of money each month so that you can have it ad free which i think is a rip off"
"January 11, 2016","App works great on my Fire tablet :) I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews!"
"September 3, 2013","I got the free app, but it wouldn't open and instead the blue pandora screen just sat there for about 5 minutes before I got annoyed and closed the app...any ideas?"
"January 19, 2013","what is not to love about Pandora? It provides me hours of great listening time with a wide variety of musical choices!"
"February 5, 2013","I really like his service. I have three differnt statons programmed. You have to fool with it a bit to get the individual statons playing your requested format, but they give Artist info and usually a list of ""like"" artists which you can add as ""seeds"". After a while, your ""station"" will be playing, pretty much, the genre you desire, along with a bunch of additions you forgot, didn't think of, or never heard of. Be patient! It'll come around. You can ""Thumbs down"" selections you don't want. I love it! One caveat . . . it is not""gender"" selective. Keep at it for a while, and you will be pleased."
"July 21, 2017","Great site"
"December 12, 2016","I've had and used Pandora for many years and just downloaded it to my Fire device, so there is not a whole lot I can say about the program itself. It works as it does on all my other devices and I am very happy with it. I also use other comparable streaming music programs, and Pandora works was well as they do."
"November 27, 2012","The free version of this software did not deliver what was promised. I could not get it to to play music at all. Could not evaluate if it was really worth buying or not!"
"March 16, 2013","I really like having the music I LIKE over and over again and can enjoy it while doing other tasks or reading on my kindle. Great product especially for being free!!"
"February 19, 2014","My Pandora app has been in session time out for 3 days. Good thing the app was free. I asked for help but those who can help must also be on time out."
"November 24, 2012","Being the old guy I am, I could never quite figure out what this was and what to do with it. If I knew more about these type things, it may actually be a great program."
"December 19, 2012","Like the sound quality..Too bad you can't download the songs or repeat the songs you like, but it puts together some amazing playlists. 5 stars for the price and sound quality, but minus 2 stars for the reasons mention."
"August 14, 2016","I haven't used it yet, but I'm sure it will be as expected."
"March 2, 2013","My only complaint is that it stops to ask me if I'm still listening. Pandora, I am still listening so stop stopping!"
"August 11, 2013","I waited 1 hour for the thing to actually work but it won't on my kindle.DO NOT get this app!!!!"
"May 1, 2014","I love that you can put in an artist or genre and listen, it is also great that when you give a song the thumbs up you get more music like it."
"October 30, 2013","I love that I can listen to my music. Whatever mood I am in at the time. Where ever I am at any given time I have access to the music that comforts me."
"September 6, 2013","This is a great app in terms of the vast amount of great music of all types, although it lacks regular updates that come on iOS. If this app would regularly update I would not even be writing this review. The old version of this software (the version that is being used on Amazon) is not a perfect answer for your music, but it is as good as it gets. Amazon charges a seller fee for every sale and I believe that is the reason that Pandora does not give regular updates on kindle; they can get such a greater profit on iTunes and Google store. It is not Pandora that is doing a bad job; it is Amazon that is not allowing its customers to get regular! updates just for the small effects amount of money they get from it. Come on Amazon"
"August 18, 2013","On the kindle fire it . Will not load and/or takes a long time to load. I do not recommend this app for kindle fire users... good for an iPod or iPad though"
"October 18, 2013","I found the inability to skip unwanted tracks simply unacceptable. Program was deleted. Amazon says I didn't use enough words so I added this sentence."
"December 16, 2016","I use this with Bluetooth in my car to stream mostly jazz thru my auto's system. I like the ability to enter the specific artist whose style of music you prefer and find artists few people have even heard of. I have the free service with few commercials that really do not bother me as they as so short."
"June 11, 2016","I like Pandora, I even paid extra not to get the commercials, but why does the music cut off before it is not finished. That's a bummer, enjoying, the boom, it stops and goes to something else."
"January 18, 2013","Now for free I can listen to my favourite bands! One direction and rihanna and Nicki minaj at my finger tips!"
"April 18, 2014","IF you have a way to keep your phone charged, Pandora has the absolutely best stATIONs ever. If it just didn't use so much of the battery."
"September 5, 2016","Awesome!! Listening to the music that I love to hear!!"
"January 19, 2013","Love Pandora, I can listen to all kinds of music all day everyday for FREE!! Don't Get Any Better Than That"
"June 26, 2013","They have changed Pandora it used to be great you didn't pick your songs but there was no commercials so unless you pay you have to listen to there crap."
"January 24, 2014","The only issue I am having with this app is that it went from being able to skip six songs per hour to know is like teen for all the station's in one so I might have to delete the app cause I liked six per station"
"September 2, 2013","The app is great sometimes, but for the majority it just freezes on the opening screen and is more or less useless now. I don't recommend this for your kindle fire until they fix it but it works great on my phone. Cant wait for this to be fixed!"
"July 19, 2017","Great"
"April 17, 2014","If you like music?? Look no further!! You have found it!! Just tell the app what you like and there it is, Happy Listening !!!"
"November 21, 2016","It's great"
"June 30, 2013","I like it because....   It plays my most favorite songs, But I only rated 4 Stars because I don't ""Love"" It because you can only do some stuffed at a certain Time. Meaning it has a limit"
"August 28, 2013","Ever since this new update my Pandora won't load. It's bad enough they changed everything else but not I can't even listen to it on my kindle."
"February 1, 2013","What else could you ask for! Easy to like something you might not have heard on traditional radio.I used to listen all the time when I was at work. Now that I am retired I listen on my computer or e-reader if I am outside!"
"July 12, 2013","Updated it today and it won't launch on my KFHD please fix.Very disappointing I wish they would tell you what's new like they do on Google play."
"August 1, 2016","This changed my life its a good app Lol"
"July 13, 2015","I enroll on my Fire Tablet and yet can't get it on my fire stick on the tv. Frustrated."
"December 30, 2013","You should not get PANDORA because IT never work's  Mine always glitchs it just gets so annoying it never does any thing right"
"July 3, 2013","I love Pandora, because I can choose the type of music I want to listen to. The sound is very good, and the music selections are excellent."
"January 22, 2014","Program is impossible for me to navigate because of the incessant ads popping up all over the screen. Ads ruin entire experience."
"October 30, 2013","This is potentially a great music app. At first it worked, then now all I get is the blue pandora logo screen. I cannot sign into it."
"April 19, 2013","I love the many different options of music to fit my mood. My favorite is the instrumental new age. I would highly suggest you listen to it."
"May 30, 2017","They turn the music down low and the commercials way loud. It is worse than most FM tadio stations. Also the repetitive commervials are even more annoying."
"April 28, 2017","I didn't ask for it...have no idea why it came to me."
"June 19, 2017","great variety and play"
"June 6, 2017","don't know if it is Pandora or Amazon but I was not able to complete the set up. Sorry"
"September 8, 2017","I like Pandora. Easy to use. Not many Ads. In all its been a great app."
"December 13, 2012","HATE THAT DOES NOT WORK OUTSIDE UNITED STATES AND CANT EVEN TRIED BECAUSE OF THAT, IF THERE IS SOME PROGRAM THAT WORKS PLEASE LET ME KNOW."
"September 19, 2014","You have to give this app permission to email your contacts without you even knowing?! I don't think so!"
"October 8, 2013","Pandora is amazing... it lets you choose the music that you want to hear and pick your own station's. And once you get more than one station, the songs that you like will be played more often."
"October 22, 2012","Pandora rocks my world! It is soooooooooooooo easy to use and the selection of musical genre is amazing, everything from Celtic to Country, Bluegrass to Rock. Five stars isn't enough."
"December 4, 2013","Kindle fire first gen. Pandora sucks on it. Don't do it. Nothing but crashes and having to re-install. Use something else."
"January 25, 2016","Pandora will not shut off when the phone rings and I am talking to someone else needs to be some type of disconnect when the phone rings Pandora or shut down temporarily"
"August 26, 2013","Screw you and your never ending stream of ads that I will never use in my life, all I want to do is listen to some damn music"
"April 11, 2013","Too many comerials. I just want simple and play music. I will just use I Heart radio. Simple and no commecials Just ads on screen."
"May 27, 2014","Perhaps the download had an error in it...whatever...I gave up trying to select music with it. It would not allow me to select different genres of music."
"December 26, 2013","I have the kindle fire HD and this app won't open for some odd reason, kinda disappointed. Please fix this if you can!"
"August 31, 2014","i heart radio"
"November 15, 2013","Love it..... very easy to use... I like I can request my own type of music. All my family can have there own fab music."
"September 22, 2013","Great choices, fun for all music lovers. It's a pleasure to be able to work on computer while listening to music I love."
"January 7, 2014","Can't rate something that doesn't work! I've had Pandora from the beginning, then I updated one day and since that day it won't even TURN ON! PANDORA SUCKS ZERO STARS until you FIX IT!"
"October 21, 2015","I liked it a lot when I started using it. There were plenty of ads, but I was able to listen to my kind of music at work without fiddling around with it too much. Then the day came when they would only play the music if I kept their app open on top--no going to another website. They wanted me to sign up for the pay version. Not happening. There are other options out there for free. I have uninstalled it."
"January 31, 2016","Like many people, when I first heard of the concept of ""free music"" I rushed to download this Pandora app. And for a while, it met all my needs. However, there is a better player in town now and his name is Spotify Music. If you just want random background noise (random music) that you have little control over, then sure...Pandora will suffice. But if you want to actually pick the song (and not just the genre!) of what you are going to listen to...then you want Spotify Music .  If you still aren't convinced though, a few more facts to help you make your decision:  PANDORA 1. Free version has ads and limitations. 2. Premium service is $4.99/month. 3. Library size - 1 million+ songs. 4. Can user pick song? NO. 5. Can user skip songs? Yes. But with limitations. 6 skips per hour, per station. No more than 30 skips in 24 hours.  SPOTIFY 1. Free version has ads and limitations. 2. Premium service is $1 for 3 month trial. Individual membership $9.99/month and each added family member gets 50% discount. 3. Library size - 30 million songs! 4. Can user pick song? YES!. 5. Can user skip songs? YES! NO LIMITS! :)"
"January 9, 2013","Won't down load, haven't listened to it yet. I'm going back to Best Buy today to have them fix it, I have it on my I phone, and it works perfect!! I listen to Adele all the time!!"
"August 29, 2017","This is great."
"February 29, 2016","I received two new charms for Christmas and loved both of them ! I have loved everything I have ever received or bought myself from Pandora ! I just love it !!"
"November 3, 2016","not usable"
"December 22, 2016","I have been to two Pandora stores Oakbrook IL. and Pandora in ChicagorRidge both had very helpful and knowledgeable sales associates. I have also been pleased with all the jewelry I have bought. I love my bracelet and charms and plan to purchase more."
"January 12, 2013","The free version isn't worth it. I have already deleted this app from my Kindle Fire. The pop- up ads totally annoyed me."
"October 13, 2017","Free music"
"October 14, 2013","Well I would be able to listen to music then it stop working. Please fix it. Then I would maybe change it.."
"October 12, 2013","I DOWNLOADED THIS ON KINDLE FIRE HD...JUST GOT A SCREEN WITH PANDORA ACROSS IT. GUESS I WILL TRY SOMETHING ELSE."
"December 10, 2016","Love having Pandora on my Kindle. Sometimes it goes to songs that I don't want, or that are not on the album that I have chosen"
"December 25, 2016","This is a rip off. Don't waste your time. Was a scam Wish we could get our money back"
"November 2, 2012","Too much work. Don't understand relationship between the TV - DVD PLAYER - MY DESKTOP... Hop around the room trying to get it all to work. but I am probably an idiot..."

"June 7, 2013","I had so m uch trouble with this app, it kept stopping and in a middle of a song it would freeze I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it didnt help too much fusterations"
"February 7, 2013","Pandora is amazing. My daughter listens to Christian music, and Pandora is so totally customizable that I tend to think of Pandora as a Christian radio station. **It is anything but a Christian radio station, since you can listen to *anything* else - one friend of mine has a classic rock station.** You can make it into anything you want.  The commercials don't bother me at all. So far there've only been decent ads (regular TV spots) and I think that this is one of the electronic products that you can ""opt out"" of the ad after so many seconds into the ad. Some of the ads are good (that is, interesting, at least to me).  Great product. I can't recommend it highly enough."
"September 6, 2013","It is excellent and very relaxingIn I enjoy it. I look forward to listening to it.Reccomend it to my friends"
"December 10, 2012","I love Pandora. It just doesn't work on my ASUS Transformer. That should be clearly stated before you waste your time."
"December 22, 2012","I cant get it to come up or open to listen to the radio,still trying to get it to work. so i cant give it a bad rate."
"January 3, 2017","I love my gospel music not so much the advertising but I understand the need for ads. Living on fixed income and every penny counts."
"March 29, 2013","On the desktop, I love this program. On the Kindle, it SUUUHUUCKKKSSS!!!! What seems like a thousand popup ads per song and way more audio advertizing between songs."
"December 30, 2012","incredible awsome super mega extra aesome pandora application incredible luck suetmega extra requete super middle psndos view the ndor in th"
"January 23, 2013","I love to listen to free music. I so like the concept of pandora. I don't mind a few ads to get to the music free. It is great to make up my own radio music choice stations. The selections that pop up are pretty right on. I would try it for free and then if you don't like it one can delete it or if you one to go a step up without the ads then pay for it."
"December 28, 2012","not sure why i have this. what's it for anyway? I need help with my kindle but there is no one to talk to. so sad."
"December 19, 2012","Since starting this media I have really enjoyed it. I enjoy all the options. Thank you! Now I am understanding the enjoyment my kids have with their smart devices."
"March 18, 2017","Can't live without it!"
"June 5, 2016","Commercials..."
"December 16, 2012","This is a great app for all you music lovers out there. I really enjoy using this app, and I'm sure you will too."
"October 30, 2013","What I want, When I want. No drive space required.Can use it on any device any time any where. Great."
"January 17, 2013","The latest version is cumbersome. The older version was so much easier to navigate. The old version kept my stations in alphabetical order. I didn't have to navigate to a different to quit. I would not havr updated had I known this."
"January 15, 2014","I didn't really choose this app. I don't understand how to use it. I don't listen to music on my phone. I would like to have apps described before installing. Jannz"
"December 19, 2013","Locked up my device immediately. I removed and reloaded it and had the same result. I have now removed it totally. Couldn't find a way to rate it LESS than 1 star."
"February 23, 2013","I can't even use it on my kindle fire hd. It said it was compatible. All it does is keep trying to log me in."
"November 27, 2013","Love the selection they choose to play based on the channels I create. Not too many advertisiments like other apps. And also like that they don't censor the lyrics."
"June 9, 2017","I was under the impression that the music available on the Echo was free. However, I found I had to subscribe to the Amazon Music Unlimited to get the music (which was the reason I bought the item). There appears to be no mixing on the sequence of songs by artists. When I ask for a specific artist, it seems to always start with the same song. The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good. I will caution those who ask me about the Echo's need for subscribed music."
"November 22, 2012","have pandora on all of my devices. it has all of the music i could ever want. i like the shuffle feature too"
"July 28, 2013","It's an app for Pandora, it plays pandora, remembers me, and doesn't glitch out. If you expect more of it, you need to reconsider why you are downloading this app"
"June 8, 2013","At times it is difficult so get to the music and operate the system. In all fairness, I am a new subscriber and am just trying to learn the system of operation."
"April 5, 2014","I like the idea of free music, but i would type in a song name and it would bring up a whole different song. It also is VERY VERY slow. Pandora can kiss my butt."
"November 29, 2012","I can't get Pandora to play right on my Kindle Fire HD. It won't play past 1 or 2 songs and then nothing..."
"April 22, 2014","I remember when Pandora first came out and how impressed by it I was. I got busy for awhile and didn't have a great phone to download it on for a few years and it sort of slipped my mind. Now that I've downloaded it to my tablet and galaxy s5, I am constantly listening to my stations. The Music Genome Project and it's results never cease to impress and amaze me. I am able to steer a station in the right direction and then Pandora turns it into an ideal station suited to my likes. Great app!"
"November 23, 2012","great music, very particular to your likes. my only criticism is the tim it takes to set up a new station"
"November 20, 2012","Haven't used this medium as yet but will try to access it from the gym.Music choices are great. I will take it to my exercise room and find it helpful."
"December 19, 2012","Love Pandora radio. we use it at work and when hanging out. so easy to set up to listen to your favorite music or discover new music also. its a must have"

"April 6, 2012","Jango is the same but without all the ads. Deleted Pandora. Too many ads. Too many ads, ads, ads. Yuk."
"January 24, 2012","this version always wants to update over my market version. amazon version has two times the ads do not install the amazon market version."

"May 14, 2013","I would like it better if I get to choose the songs instead of the genre. Just not for me."
"April 17, 2013","Dude... listening to music while reading one of your favorite good book... what could be better. I love Pandora and commercials are very minimal."
"March 19, 2016","This was complicated to get to work on the kindle. You have to install and uninstall for whatever reason to get it to play."

"September 29, 2013","cumbersome stupid and slow not worth the effort crap crap crap 9 more words required and they would all be negative"
"December 2, 2013","This app is HORRIBLE! It may be free but it is simply a waste of time to download. Three out of four times that I open the app it gets stuck on the main screen and I have to restart my device in hopes to make the app work. Also, many of times the app lags and/or stops working completely. Not to mention the TERRIBLE music selection. I hate this app and it is a waste of your and my time.You would be better of paying Spotify's monthly fee."
"December 28, 2012","Won't let me create a free account. >:( not impressed. Please make this not a problem or I will delete. 1 star"

"December 19, 2012","Great variety of updated music, lots of choices & especially love the ability to say I don't want to hear certain songs."
"November 3, 2013","SO, I actually love when apps get updates, because I love to see all the new features that it contains. For this app, in particular...Well, let me first start off with this. I've been a huge Pandora fan, for so long. Maybe even over four years. I have it on every device that I have, but I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to switch I Heart Radio, but I can't. I But now, I believe it might be time to find a new radio. This app sucks now. The new symbol bothered me at first, but I'm used to it. But as soon as Pandora updated to 5.0, MY STATIONS DON'T PLAY. It keeps saying, 'We cannot find any more music for this station. Please, try a different station.' I did almost one hundred times and it keeps saying that. Pandora, you're about to lose a customer, if you don't get it together."
"March 4, 2013","i downloaded this onto my Kindle Fire but honestly i do not sure it. i'm sure for those who use it they probably like it"

"February 22, 2013","Great station--love that you can put in a name of a singer and it will bring up other artist like the one you put in!!!"
"March 6, 2014","Because it jut throws out sings like some songs u don't like and then u use up all your skips but besides that it's good"
"July 24, 2014","I suppose that it's OK if you want to be forced to listen to music that you are not interested in. I deleted the app."
"October 30, 2013","I love it .. my only inspirational station. Recommended to all my friends and family members looking for great music."
"June 8, 2016","I love this app the only problem is the skip limits and ads but otherwise it great I love it"

"December 26, 2013","This app does everything it says it will. That has been a rare occurrence. I love that you can see the song lyrics."
"December 7, 2013","I am satisfied with the app. I never give anything a perfect score other than GOD. Music is the universal message."
"December 19, 2012","Really the best radio station out there. I like all the indie stuff, and how it customizes your stations for you"

"May 3, 2017","I love it. I can listen to older music that is not on radio."

"April 19, 2013","just pass it by.Pandora is the worst app they don't play good songs. I wasn't allowed you go on it."
"August 19, 2013","This is a fun game but the free version is a little annoying when ads keep popping up while playing."

"February 20, 2013","I love this app. I listen to music I haven't heard in years and it just takes me way back."
"October 10, 2016","A good app to get lots of music. A few too many ads perhaps but that's the trade-off for ""free."" The ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" feature is also helpful to keep getting music that you want. Has everything I wanted including 60/70/80, classical, and ""old fogey"" music."
"November 11, 2013","i am out of country and can not use it. So untill I can it is of no use . I need to remove."
"September 16, 2016","Paid for the year last Christmas. Commercials free is the way to go. Nothing worse at a house party than commercials."

"September 6, 2014","I have not used his on my Kindle Fire yet. Only on my Television and I love it."
"January 21, 2013","Music is good, commercials not so much. I heard less than 10 songs and two sets of commercials when I decided it had to go. Bring it down to 5% commercials and maybe I'll come back... and no- I won't pay for music to not own it. I buy and download lots of music legally so the commercials are even more annoying. I can hit random on my own collection and do better."
"January 16, 2014","I am new to Pandora, when I can figure out how to us it, I think I will enjoy it."
"December 16, 2015","I hate this so much I wish I could give it a 000000000 star"
"November 3, 2011","Why do any of these apps need to access anything in your phone? I guess this is the cost of having an open system. I'll be ju jumping ship and moving to the iphone.. You're just asking to be hacked, (banking email etc.) by installing applications with how many permissions...  Only an idiot would install such apps..  I kind of blame amazon for not screening these app and requiring them to be permission free..."
"December 18, 2015","don't recall placing an order for this. what's going on?"
"May 13, 2017","This app is awesome. I can listen to music and ignore people! Now I don't have to listen to my brother and his friend talk and play on the Xbox."
"February 11, 2014","Amazingly Pandora works great, even with a low bandwidth connection. You can find pretty much any genre of music on Pandora and have it generate a 'station' for you."
"October 4, 2016","Everything you ever want to find / hear!"
"September 2, 2013","Unfortunately the app never gets past the blue loading screen with the Pandora logo. Pretty disappointing considering how often I use Pandora on my pc.  Edit: Updated to 5 stars, app now works perfectly."

"December 13, 2015","have on phone. pay again. not happening"
"April 4, 2013","Pandora sucks! They say it is FREE, but you only get 40 hours free, after that you have to pay 99 cents till the end of the month, when they reset it, or pay $3.99 a month for pandora one, which is commercial free."
"September 3, 2014","Awesome music. Sorry it took me so long to try it out."

"December 16, 2012","When I want to login, put in my email address and password. Told it's not recognized. Try to rejoin, now told my 4 digit birthday not right. Birthday has not changed in 70 years. Pandora has lost another listener."

"February 11, 2017","Good music"
"November 23, 2015","I paid the annual fee so I don't have the pesky commercials. I just love the music selection. The only thing I don't like is when I choose a song from a performer as a ""radio"" the song doesn't play. I have to wait for it to eventually come up. For instance I really, really wanted to hear ""Over the Rainbow"" by the wonderful Hawaiian singer so I clicked on the song and added it to my ""radio."" Another song played and I never could get Over the Rainbow. Other than that, I love Pandora and love the ease that I can add it to my car, my tablets, phone, etc. Very user friendly."
"July 4, 2015","I like the old-time and new Blues..."
"July 24, 2014","Really great app, the ads just get annoying."
"January 30, 2013","B b b b b b b b b be b b b b g f h j nb b. no"
"March 7, 2016","This would be an excellent app except for the fact that every other time I start it or it gets an update it stops playing any music at all. Song titles and info appear for the expected duration of the track but no sound is played and there isn't even an animation to indicate that something might be trying to play. When the next update arrives it functions normally again. Until the next time. Very frustrating."
"September 3, 2014","What else is there to say. I love Pandora."
"September 3, 2014","have really enjoyed this station........"
"October 4, 2016","love it!"
"December 23, 2014","I MUST GIVE PANDORA 5 STARS. AS SOON AS I SAID WHAT I LIKED THE MUSIC STARTED . I AM A JAZZ FAN (EASY LISTENING) AND NO MATTER WHAT DEVICE I OPENED THEY PLAYED MY MUSIC. IT HAS OPENED UP SOME NEW ARTISTS FOR ME - SOME I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH AND THEY ALSO GIVE YOU A BRIEF HISTORY OF THESE STARS. I HAD HEARD OF PANDORA BUT NEVER THOUGHT TO USE IT UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO.I AM DEFINITELY A FAN!"

"January 3, 2014","This app started out working as expected. After a short time it suddenly would not shut down. No matter what I tried it would not stop playing. I finally managed to reach the Kindle home page and remove it from the device. It was the only way it would shut off. I don't really trust it enough to reload it."
"September 3, 2014","Great music and easy to use."
"April 28, 2016","Five"
"December 20, 2012","I love this personal music media! You can create your own ""radio station"" by choosing your own favorites.

"May 30, 2013","I have downloaded Pandora , And it is horrible not only cause I can't skip more than six songs but even if I skip or thumbs down a song it will be played once again in the future . And that's not the only problem Pandora takes forever to load up and takes for ever for a new some to star when switch stations or just skip a song , I love that Pandora has New song an old schooling but with all of these problems it's just not worth it."
"September 6, 2014","love all the songs"

"September 11, 2013","I love Pandora but this app won't open on my kindle. The app freezes on the Pandora blue screen every time. Have uninstalled and reinstalled it a number of times with no change. Disappointing."
"August 22, 2014","Of all my music media, this is by far the best. Easy to use and the method used to select your favorites is superb. I have it on my Kindle and hook up speakers for home entertainment."
"February 17, 2014","Love that I can listen to my kind of music when I want. I don't have to listen to a lot of music that I don't care for or be subjected to endless advertisements or news"
"April 5, 2013","This is stupid pandora used to be a great app but now i have only 40 free music hours a month!!! Thats pathetic. OR I HAVE TO UPGRADE TO PANDORA 1?! or pay 99 cents a month!! DO NOT GET PANDORA IS PATHETIC. i would change my review to 5 stars once this is changed it should be free but u can have pandora 1"
"January 21, 2013","I'm hooked on Pandora. I can listen to spefically the music I like anywhere with just my cellphone. Having a Pandora account lets you select precisely what you want to listen to based on your favorite artists. I'm very happy using Pandora."
"May 22, 2013","Pandora is too add heavy for me. The ad format is obnoxious with large pop ups in the middle of the screen which are not easily closed. The in app purchase to get rid of most of the ads is problematic. This spoiled an otherwise good app."
"February 22, 2013","My son downloaded this for me. I had heard about Pandora but didn't know how great it was. Yes, there are a few commercials but not too many to make you want to pay for the no commercial service. Music is great and so many choices!"
"February 18, 2013","Pandora has been down for a couple days and I haven't been able to listen to any of my music and its kind of upsetting. Some of my apps wont even play either but I'm connected to WiFi and it makes no sense.  3/12/13- still, Pandora is down on the kindle for some reason I figured it would start working after a while but no, still no Pandora as a matter of fact the whole app store is down, everytime I try to redownload the app it says app could not be found in the appstore and then I try to go to the app store but it doesn't connect yet the whole time I have WiFi"
"January 3, 2013","it added random music from batman to my halo station this app blows don't get it instead. get yuotube frridi downloader"

"November 27, 2016","Can you guys please update the app, it's a bit outdated, I don't have replays, and since I bought pandora one I can't listen offline"
"November 24, 2012","Love the variety of free music. I use it to study and reflect. It is probably the most used app."
"January 23, 2013","I love Pandora and if you do as well get this app. I use it for my Kindle Fire and is a must have."
"February 10, 2014","This is a perfect product for me because I have a Genre that has a handful of artists I know of, but the intelligence will seek others that I've never heard of. They can be deleted or kept at your desecration. The sound quality is very good and its easy to use. 5 stars."
"January 21, 2013","I DO LOVE PANDORA. I HAVE IT ON MYCOMPUTER AS WELL AS MY KINDLE. MY KINDLE IS NEW TO ME SO DO NOT KNOW IF MY MUSICIS ACCESSIBLE OFFLINE. PROBABLY NOT AND THIS WOULD BE DISAPPOINTING. THANKS."
"October 8, 2017","Love the app. I pay the extra $5.00 and get the ad free version. Love the Zen Garden radio, very calming but not put you to sleep calming. There is so many stations. They have stations for cardo, latin, dance, hip hop, and coutry workout stations."
"April 16, 2016","It won't let me sign in it always says thanks for ur interest unfortunately we are not taking registrations right now."
"September 10, 2016","this is my favorite streaming music app and I love music and a variety of types of music. and on pandora I can listen to all of them from POP to Opera and save music to my thumbs up radio and play all the music and types of music i love all at one time. it almost never spend time buffering and is updated often"
"November 19, 2013","don't get me wrong, I LOVE Pandora but I DON'T love this app. Is nearly impossible to open it in my kindle fire anymore and barely works when I want it to."

"March 5, 2012","after update gone downhill. only plays a few seconds then constant skips. trying new apps now. sorry Pandora i used to recommend you."
"January 21, 2013","My all time favorite! I have about 6 stations to match my mood. I go to sleep listening to my Kurt Whalum jazz station. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!"
"January 3, 2014","No matter where I am, it's a very slow start up connection. Used to be a great ap everywhere. I will have to search for a new means of online music."
"August 24, 2016","I wish they sold a subscription to have music w/out commercials. I get so tired of Geico commercials. But I like being able to like songs, and when you dislike them the song stops immediately: I like that."
"February 12, 2013","Pandora One on Kindle Fire frustrates. You cannot use Pandora without being nagged to upgrade to One. When you follow the link you cannot go to the Pandora web site even though the option is presented. You must go to the Amazon store which is frustrating in itself. At the Amazon store, you have to search for Pandora One and it then only finds Pandora. If you ever do get to Pandora One in the Amazon store it will not download or install. Pandora is great. Amazon Store is frustrating and I hesitate to use it"
"January 12, 2013","I love Pandora on my android but it won't work on my kindle for. Error msg says Pandora unable to connect to server. So frustrating bc I wanted to see Pandora on a bigger screen to read lyrics..."
"April 1, 2013","It would be nice to be able to add more of your own artists. Since it does all of the selecting, I can't listen to some of my favorite artists."
"November 3, 2011","Careful they are currently under a federal investigation for selling personal info like contacts in your phone, your location, age, phone id...etc."
"December 21, 2012","Terrible... it kept freezing up and the advertisements are annoying, too long & too frequent. I would NOT recommend this to anyone"
"January 23, 2014","i always like this app until it cycles through and plays the same songs over and over again no matter what setting i have it on."
"August 9, 2016","This app is very confusing. I cant make playlists of one song, instead i have to listen to WHOLE ALBUMS. Another problem is when im listening to my favorite band, it switches to a different band for me that i probably dont want to listen to. And on top of that is the CONSTANT ADVERTISEMENTS. I know that advertising is in all apps but i DONT WANT AN ADD AFTER EVERY SINGLE SONG. Overall, one star pandora, im switching to spotify."
"April 22, 2013","I used pandora for the past year and all of a sudden i can't listen to music at all without having to pay. YOU WOULDA THOUGHT!"
"May 25, 2013","Major pandora balls its always messing up and can never jus play as pits supposed to sumbody needs to make a new one"
"December 30, 2012","I thoght this was the free radio station on the internet and haven't tried it since it requires a password."
"March 2, 2013","I love that every recording artist I love seems to have their own station. Pandora is great and I Love it!"
"March 2, 2017","ThankYou"
"March 8, 2017","Pandora keeps getting confused about the DIFFERENT stations I create. I like various types of music. Pandora often mixes them up. Other than that, it's pretty good."
"November 23, 2012","The music sounds great! i have the kindle fire hd and the dolby sound is awesome. i highly recommend it."
"January 3, 2014","Am I missing something? Any app that I would like to have does not work on this device. Not happy."
"October 19, 2011","2 much advertising! i want the old pandora with no distribution of nonsense.. download @ own risk lol sky is better or lil shark"
"October 9, 2013","I thought this app looked good until I downloaded it. It doesn't even open! It just stays on a blue screen with Pandora in the center. I literally waited about half an hour for it to open. Nothing happens. Just saying I got it for the Kindle Fire HD.Don't download it. It's not worth it. (unless you like looking at blue screens, of course) -.-"
"January 20, 2013","Cannot open it - it seems it did not load. I would appreciate knowing what I am doing wrong in getting these apps."
"December 27, 2014","I have to admit when I was first introduced to Pandora I was rather skeptical. However without a doubt it has become my go to app for music. To be able to build music lists from categories, names, styles, genres, or even song titles is just plain awesome. Even though you can't pick the songs that are played on your list you can help it evolve by giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings. I realize that since Pandora has come out there is newer and more sophisticated music apps coming out but so far I keep coming back to Pandora. Personally I subscribe to Pandora One which has been $36 per year and allows you to listen to music non-stop without commercial interruption. Highly recommended."
"June 25, 2016","This sucks can't find any good music every thing sucks fix it know add.all iTunes music it has better"
"February 23, 2013","I think I would love this app if I could get it to connect. I sign in and wait and wait and wait..."
"April 22, 2016","I love this app you can discover new artists and songs and listen to the ones you already love. I love Pandora."
"November 24, 2012","Cool app, fairly easy to use. Can sometimes play the same artists a bit to repetitively. It's free so I can deal with the ad bombardment."
"January 26, 2013","The ads have gotten out of control on my Fire HD. App ads pop up every time I adjust the volume (in Pandora). I had 4 pop ups within the first minute of the 1st song playing immediately after launching Pandora (first time). Not acceptable, think I need to find an alternate program."
"November 26, 2012","It's awesome! Never used it before and never had the chance until I purchased a Kindle. I love that I can select the type of music I like and listen to it whenever I want to."
"March 5, 2016","I've had a paid subscription to Pandora for about a year now and it's been pretty decent. The service has been almost flawless, a month ago I did an upgrade of the app on my iphone 4s and Pandora started crashing (buffering errors and freezing). It took 2 weeks for a newer version to be available for download, after downloading the newer version the program stopped crashing (buffering errors and freezing). The one other thing that bothers me is that Pandora will not let you skip as many songs as you want, even though you are a paid subscriber. I understand they have to pay for every song played or skipped, but I'm paying them to be able to skip at my leisure and they wont allow it. The stations I create are always compiled great and the thumb print radio feature plays all my likes, which is really cool. There are other music streaming apps out there but to me Pandora is the most well rounded as far as having the most songs and artist I like. I use Pandora on my computer and all my devices, as for now I am going to keep using Pandora until something better is available."
"October 17, 2013","I love that I can listen to the kind of music I like when I want to. It's one of my favorite pass times when I'm relaxing in the evenings and on weekends."
"August 31, 2017","Deep library, intuitive UI. I would pay to get rid of the commercials IF they had an API for my linux media setup. Spotify has the api but $10/mo seems too much. Amazon does not seem to have much of a free library, Most the songs i searched for required signup."
"August 16, 2016","Love"
"January 17, 2012","Every time there is an update needed it gets so many problems.. then when I download the update more severe problems occur. Please someone make a GOOD radio app so I can uninstall this P.O.S, thanks."
"November 10, 2012","Often glitch, volume won't play, can't bookmark,, And it won't let me ""quit"" pandora..... music is great but often can't hear sound. overal needs an update."
"April 11, 2017","do know my grand kids ordered this"
"November 15, 2012","I wasn't aware that I purchased Pandora and am not sure how to install or use it. I have an iPhone, iPad, and Kindle Fire. Am I able to access Pandora on all three? Are there instructions, and how much was spent for this purchase? Thank you for your assistance."
"May 20, 2017","Too many commercials"
"April 19, 2016","As stated, last update broke Pandora completely & now hangs instead of loading. When working I'd give it 5 stars - the alarm feature is particularly a plus & when broken it disrupts waking up to Pandora. ..One other thing - Pandora One has promised to work on upgrading stream quality beyond full-blown computers & five years later it's DOA - disappointing."
"March 9, 2017","ok"
"July 25, 2017","Good."
"December 18, 2012","it has n t showed up on my app library yet but I'm very excited for it to! I can't wait to start listening to music."
"September 7, 2017","Fave"
"November 2, 2013","I updated the app on my kindle fire and now the app won't open. It just says Pandora but never opens."
"October 31, 2013","You are totally responsible for me spending entirely too much time playing Scrabble! Trying to be competition for my aunt who is a whiz."
"May 8, 2017","Help is useless. Can't download songs. No search bar. Nothing to help with ""activate code from device."" Not even any relevant results with ""how to activate a device"" So far this trial is going poorly."
"November 24, 2012","I like being able to listen to what I want when I want. Have this on my phone and listen to it in the car instead of the radio stations in the city."
"February 17, 2013","Pandora is so feaking good and I just love to lesson to one direction and I love them kiss you"
"December 8, 2016","Yeah, Amazon version is missing something (functionality). I get false no connection error, too. I"
"January 21, 2013","Pandora is great and everything, but I can't really US it without WiFi for the Kindle Fire HD. I think this one is different from the one on the Apple products."
"February 11, 2017","Love it. My son downloaded it for me on my Kindle Fire. I've added different artists already. I think it's great. Very interesting on how the people at Pandora can choose different songs that would still appeal to the listener. Thank you."
"March 15, 2014","There is always room for improvement. Keep up the great work. Every change you make makes Pandora better. Thanks for Pandora."
"December 4, 2012","I really like this. You can find the music you want easier. It comes it get. I don't have to worry about it fading out."
"July 13, 2017","I need pandora really now"
"November 25, 2016","Pandora is the best place to listen to music because you can choose your favorite genre and musicians. I love it."
"April 2, 2017","they have some frickin good tunes"
"December 23, 2013","I used to love this app but now it will not work. Then if does all it does not play music."
"September 10, 2013","CLICK open and it just sits there... Tried restarting my kindle, and had no luck. Good thing this app was free..."
"August 15, 2013","When I first got this app I could open it any time I wanted now I wait and wait and wait it never lets me sign in"
"November 24, 2012","Each station I've listened to so far has very good suggestions on what i'd like to hear. And it's very easy to use, which is great for a newbie to android like me."
"December 28, 2012","I like a variety of music. I like to be able to pick an artist and play music by them yet have other similar artists thrown into the mix."
"August 1, 2016","Love it when it actually allows me to sign in..."
"May 21, 2013","it cost money if u use it too much or even a little its a good app for a while but cost money"
"June 23, 2013","It does not work on my Kindell and I cannot figure out what to do. It should be easier to be able to solve these problems.  Lis"
"December 4, 2012","Easy to use & you can set as many ""stations"" as you want. A few ads but I don't mind in the free version"
"November 24, 2012","I'm in love with Pandora night and day because I can hear my favorite bands from long ago and listen to songs that the radio does not give air time to anymore. Or the surprise of hearing a band that Pandora choose in that same line-up that you love as well. We searched for two years for a server, never giving up the hope that we could install wt-fi to receive Pandora in our home. We live in a cabin in the mountains, very isolated, but we searched constantly until we finally found a server in an adjoining state!*!* That's how much I, we, love Pandora*★*"
"June 28, 2013","I love Pandora, the ability to choose the artist I like and then similar songs also play from that genre is great. I love it!"
"April 26, 2017","Use to be great. I could hear two or three songs before getting an ad. That is totally fair for free music. Sometimes, you could watch a short video and get a free hour, which was awesome. Now it is crap. It will play one song, maybe two, then three to four ads. In a 30 minute time frame I'm hearing more ads then music. It has a ""Why ads"" option, which just tells you to upgrade. Nope, not upgrading, I'm just going to find another option."
"October 17, 2016","Missing a lot of my favorite artists. Ex: Sik World"
"December 28, 2012","This is great! love it, play it on my tv also. It replays a lot of songs but I like that I can skip them."
"November 27, 2012","This app is great. Such a varity of music to choose from. eventhough there are advertisements it still is great to listen to."
"November 15, 2013","I would give this five stars if… IT WOULD EVEN WORK!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHH it's so frustrating. I want to give it five stars but I can't"
"March 21, 2016","It normally works well but it isn't working for me right now.."
"September 8, 2016","I usually read while on the step mill. The other day someone next to me was talking loud on their phone so I couldn't concentrate on the reading I was doing. I quickly downloaded the Pandora app, plugged in my headphones and promptly tuned them out."
"September 2, 2017","Amazing! It worked perfectly on my amazon fire!"
"December 4, 2012","i like to choose and setup my listening preferences and this format allows me to like or dislike my choices"
"November 24, 2012","A must have for any music lover! I listen to it all day everyday! Couldn't live without it. Love it!"
"March 8, 2017","Pandora is a wonderful app, 5 dollars a month I can listen to any artist or song whenever and as long as I want. Love it"
"April 11, 2016","Ever since it was updated it only plays a couple of songs and then gets stuck on buffering. Pleaseee fix this :("
"May 30, 2017","I tried to use Pandora back in 2007 and I didn't like it. But my brother-in-law re-introduced Pandora to be on a road trip and I love it. They have really stepped up their game. I listen to it all the time now."
"January 13, 2013","I was playing some music when I decided to change stations. This trailer video poped up showing some demen girls that scare the hell out of me. I'm still shaking... adds pop up sometimes.... to me I say goodbye pandora."
"September 24, 2016","My job is somewhat stressful and for me, music is calming. Being able to choose the songs I want, saying thumbs down to the songs I don't care for and hearing music I've not heard before makes my work day better. I love Pandora radio."
"January 4, 2013","This has to be one of my favorite apps! I like being able to find the genres of music that I like and the artists and make stations that are to my liking. I don't even mind the ads! I grew up listening to my transistor radio in high school and this is better!"
"November 16, 2012","I installed Pandora twice in my phone and it didn't work correctly either time. It only plays about 30 seconds of the songs and skips to the next one. Who wants to listen to music like that? I love Pandora on my pc but hate it on my phone. I use IHR on my phone now."
"December 27, 2012","Pandora did not work when I tried using it. I got it cause I love music but it didn't work for me."
"December 27, 2012","Like pandora but it won't let me download it in the kindle it gives me a hard time and it says I have it but don't have it in the kindle"
"September 9, 2013","Just doesn't work most of the time on Kindle. Seems to work fine on my iPod. I hope that they fix it, because I like their music selections."
"May 23, 2016","LOVE this app. I tried Spotify because a friend said they liked it better, but I have to say I switch to Pandora more often and love the music. My biggest complaint is I started 'thumbs up-ing' a few songs and now my stations are TOTALLY different and I can't get back to the original playlists, sigh."
"November 13, 2012","says its available in my apps but i cant find pandora any wheres so im unable to use it on my new kindle fire. im not very good on these things lol"
"April 19, 2013","I downloaded it being all excited with a smiley face. Then after the download I realised that it do not work outside the US as a large message appeared stating such. So it is probably a great app. Just wont work for me."
"April 14, 2016","Glitches every once in awhile. I'm not an over the top enthusiast or mater, but this is not the best, still pretty good and that's that. Nothing else to it"
"April 9, 2013","I thought this would be the actual game. It is just a bidding practice app; good as it is, I wanted the game"
"March 14, 2014","The decor of my kitchen is in Coca Cola. I loved Cokefor a long time now. I guess you can say I'm a Coke Woman and I won't drink anything else. That's final."
"November 12, 2016","I love and listen to Pandora all day every day Pandora for ever❤⭐"
"December 13, 2013","I like ponys and you should like ponys too because they are our friends Kathy has a pony named Tony"
"July 17, 2016","Like the fact that I can just pick a song or artist and the song plays or related songs play. Also I can make my own station. Whuch is perfect when driving a long ways ."
"April 28, 2017","Love my music😀"
"November 3, 2013","I downloaded Pandora to my kindle fire and it refuses to open. I get to the loading screen and sit their until it kicks me out."
"April 5, 2016","This app is ok but there is a lot of ads. Sometimes you can't pick a song you like. You could get this app if you want but, this is just a warning."
"October 11, 2013","App hangs up and doesn't want to open without 10+ attempts on a regular basis. Have tried to help. No responses"
"July 7, 2017","Edit: Found an update which wasn't showing up when I wrote the original review, actually had to search for Pandora in the app store, rather than just looking at my app downloads (which brought me to the Pandora app page in the store, but all it said was ""open"" and not ""update""), in order to be able to download the update. Sound quality is fixed, but the song name still doesn't change when the song does.  Original Review: Audio quality sounds terrible compared to my 2012 KFHD7, I use High Quality in both devices. App does not display the new song title when the song changes. Videos on mobile YouTube sound 10x better than this version of the Pandora App. App needs to be fixed, as it is not playing high quality audio and is not updating the name of the song."
"April 9, 2016","There are not a lot of ads, the stations they have are great and the songs are soooo good too I love coming on here all the time."
"April 5, 2017","If was free at first but now it asking for coins 😮. I didn't know it was a charge after a while."
"December 28, 2012","I have this app on my Kindle Fire HD and it works great. Allows me to have streaming music anywhere I take my kindle fire!"
"April 5, 2017","The app keeps force closing."
"June 7, 2017","Pandora had been my go to streaming music app for years and I use it daily. It doesn't drain the battery on my kindle as fast as it does on my phone, so it gets used more thru my kindle now."
"October 22, 2016","Love the app. Great way to enjoy the music w/o costing an arm and leg."
"November 22, 2012","Great selections of the works of the world's best composers! I love the variety of selections and the ability to be able to listen to excellent music while performing other chores on my computer!"
"June 17, 2017","I like Pandora. Sometimes I can't find certain songs I'm looking for but usually it's great. Easy to move through. Very enjoyable."
"July 20, 2016","I love music -- all kinds of music!!! PANDORA GIVES ME THAT! I can thumbs up the music I love and thumbs down what I don't. I can also listen to all of my thumbs up music on one station! I am able to create or select already created stations. If I want to listen to Country Music, I have several stations to choose from. I have Rock Music by decades from the 60's to today. Whatever strikes your fancy, Pandora delivers! I highly recommend Pandora to all music lovers of all ages!"
"February 15, 2017","I've been a Pandora fan since it first started and it has come a long way. I up graded to Pandora Plus, couldn't be happier. Less than a cup of coffee at starshucks. (Spelling intentionally) Would give the app and entertainment a ten star if I could. Commercials on the free app can get a little much but for the most part they were entertaining too. Lots of information about the songs and artists. Can't go wrong."
"June 24, 2016","I love how I get to listen to similar types of music based on the musicians I type in. Pandora is a great app to listen to music and to listen to new ones I haven't heard of."
"October 25, 2016","Great music you won't find on satellite radio...worth buying the commercial free package"
"October 5, 2017","To many commercials!"
"October 30, 2012","Its amazing how easily can find my favor music in one station and its free! I love it, I love it, I love it."
"November 24, 2012","My son got me unto Pandora. To listen to great music with less commercial interruption than you would experience on any commercial radio station at no cost to me is a no brainer"
"February 20, 2017","So yeah...rn I'm listening to a bunch of electronica which is electronic music XD . You can listen to all of you favorite bands on this thingy OwO"
"October 30, 2013","This app is the worst I registerd and then later I tried to log in and it said sorry this dosent exist worst app do not download it just want money :("
"March 11, 2017","love it!!!"
"April 4, 2013","I like the app and all, but if Pandora is going to say free music, it should be free. Those pirates charged me 99 because apparently I reached my limit of free music for April. Well it's April 4 And I barely even listen to it. Either they fix this or I sue them for lieing about what their product offers. Free music my a$$."
"April 28, 2017","I love this app. I have adhd and I use Pandora to help fall asleep. I really like how it picks up what type of music you like. I highly recommend this app. If I could change one thing, it would be that I wish you could have songs that are your favorites and some that you like."
"June 22, 2016","Just installed on my Kindle Fire and it says ""Waiting to connect. Retry?"" But I have full WiFi connectivity."
"November 29, 2014","Just started this romance, so still very much in love. First, there's my music. Than there's my music followed by,well you known. Oh boy, a suggestion, we love them too. So what's to be bad? Did I hear a commercial. No, that's only my attorney friend from down the street remaining me when that accident happens, well she will be ready, willing and able. Welcome to the new sound of music."
"May 29, 2017","Love my Pandora! She finds all the music I need."
"November 24, 2012","I love Pandora! The app is awesome because you can take it with you anywhere! You can even hook it up in your car and it becomes your stereo!"
"April 5, 2017","This the worst pandora won't let me listen to my favorite music !!!!!!!!!! :(:(:(::(:(:(:(:(:(:(::("
"May 12, 2017","The Pandora app loads fine at home but not at school and others can access thed app but not Amazon people Fix it or uninstalling it"
"June 4, 2017","My favorite app!works great!"
"February 23, 2016","Very good at stringing together music that sounds sort of like what you typed in. I particularly like how it is divided into ""stations,"" so as your mood shifts, you can switch stations simply, and get a new vibe. The ads are a little spooky though. They are all about home, and when I am on the road, that deprives me of the experience of foreign radio culture."
"December 2, 2016","Pandora is great. I love it- you can listen to the music you already like and at the same time get introduced to similar artists and songs. You can search by artist, genre, or song. It even has some pretty obscure music. And it's free! Everyone I know uses Pandora."
"April 18, 2016","Create your own stations to personalize what music you hear. Started with Pandora for my desktop and laptop computer, so was very familiar with the software and was an easy decision to get it for my phone."
"May 19, 2017","I use Pandora when I walk."
"May 9, 2016","Pandora gives me continues music that I love."
"September 20, 2016","What a gift to wake up every day and listen to my favorite Glory and Praise music. Thank You."
"June 24, 2016","Great app!! You can't beat free music. I use pandora all the time on my phone and fire tablet. Unfortunately for Pandora, I still use Spotify on my computer"
"November 24, 2012","This app allows me to have all of the music I enjoy listening to right at my fingertips! No more purchasing CD's!"
"October 17, 2016","Great customizable music"
"October 5, 2016","The only thing I don't like about it is that you need Wi-Fi. Other than that its perfect."
"September 27, 2016","This. Has. Awesome. Music. Do. You. Like. Music?"
"May 7, 2017","I love pandora . The only thing I would change is sometimes when I choose an artist that's what I want to hear that artist. I wish it gave you the option to hear songs from that artist only. It should be also an option to choose to listen the way it is set up now too though."
"November 11, 2016","Great"
"May 24, 2017","We love Pandora. It is great to pick an artist and walk away knowing that we will have hours of music without the hassle of selecting a new album or heaven forbid, changing a CD. We use it at work as background music and love it."
"November 21, 2012","This app is awesome. I don't know why everybody looks at the bad things and never at the good things. Enjoy what you can people. The only bad thing is that you can only skip songs 6 times per hour but still it is a great app."
"November 13, 2016","Ease of use. Lots of choices. Immediate response to your request. Reliable performance."
"April 17, 2013","Pandora is no longer is free, you get a limited time to listen to music each month unless you buy the whole version or pay .99 a month. Even though that's inexpensive why pay to listen to the radio? Download iheartradio, it's the same exact thing legit but completely free."
"February 25, 2015","You get to pick the artist or the types of songs you like and they play a variety associated with your selection. They have a ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" feature to us if you like (they play that song maybe more often and ones like it) or if you don't like a song, they won't play it again. I'm very happy with the variety of the songs they play"
"September 16, 2016","I've used Pandora on other devices in the past and love, love, love it. It gives me the option of trying out new music before purchase, and also allows me to take some music with me when I leave home. Great choice of stations to listen to also."
"April 9, 2012","Pandora is always on point! Never fails to deliver the best music choices in the genres I choose. I am NEVER disappointed."
"June 22, 2016","I HAVE BEEN USING PANDORA FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SELECTIONS THEY GIVE ME FOR MY ENJOYMENT. NEVER HAD A PROBLEM AND I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS."
"January 23, 2013","I cant even get this thing to load up to let me sign in...I'm installing this until it's fixed. Let's get it together Pandora!"
"May 23, 2017","Love the music. I can have it anytime, anywhere. I can choose the kind of music I like. Love it."
"November 20, 2016","This is my favorite ...."
"March 30, 2017","Layout could use updating and improvements."
"January 11, 2017","👍wonderful"
"April 15, 2017","Its a great way for me to find new music that I love and I can also share new music with my bestie! I can work on homework and not have to sing the same songs repeatedly! My review: love it!!!"
"February 12, 2016","With all the music apps that I have downloaded and deleted from my phone, Pandora is the only one I've kept. If I listen to a customized playlist of songs I own, I will eventually get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again. With a station on Pandora, however, I get songs that I familiar with and new songs, in a random order each time. If I don't like a song, I simply hit ""thumbs down"". If I like a song, I hit ""thumbs up"" and it plays more frequently than other songs on that station. Over time, the station becomes so customized that I am listening to lots of songs I like plus new songs I've never heard before. It's nice to shake things up sometimes."
"October 27, 2016","Music my heart desires, without fuss. Pandora delivers a delicious balance of inobtrusiveness and musical satisfaction."
"April 28, 2017","Awesome app and always great music"
"September 28, 2015","Unbelievable, this product meets and exceeds everything i was told about this unit. My buddy told me about this product snd i trusted his word. Let me tell ya, if your having trouble with your wi-fi connection, look no further. You've found the answer with this little gem. Buy it NOW, buy one for your friend, just make sure u buy it. U wont b disappointed!!!"
"May 31, 2017","Finally followed advice to try this music site. Using free option for listening. Thought by choosing my singer it would be all their music but includes similar genre singers. Ok but not what I expected."
"April 21, 2017","Its great!!! :D!! The only bad things are that it puts on random songs (and some are annoying ._.) and that you can't search :\,Otherwise its great!!!! :)"
"June 7, 2017","I listen to this everyday. Very addictive."
"August 24, 2016","EDIT: Inexplicably, I was finally able to get the app to work, but I don't understand how. It wasn't showing up in my BlackBerry World list of installed apps, though there was an icon on the home screen. So, I went to the Amazon App Store, from which I had installed the app, and acted like I wanted to install it again. It told me that I already had installed the app...and then the app opened. I logged in and listened to a few minutes of music, then closed the app. I expected not to be able to re-launch the app, but lo and behold, it launched fine. I then went to BlackBerry World to recheck the list of installed apps and Pandora still wasn't listed, perhaps because it was installed via the Amazon App Store. Regardless, I'm upping my stars from two to four.  I am a daily Pandora user on Android devices, smart TVs, etc., and want to be able to use it on my BlackBerry Classic. It installed, but will not launch. If anyone has tips on how to get Pandora to work on a BlackBerry Classic running OS 10.3.2.556, I'm all ears!"
"March 30, 2017","I love the southern and country but there are so many good songs that we used to sing back in the 50's that are being left out. So maybe we should have recorded them ourselves in that little church in Colville Washington like Got Any Rivers you think are uncrossable. And When God Dips His Love In My Heart and I'm having trouble with Pandora music coming on in the middle of the night when I did not set it for that is that at your end oif the line or mine?"
"June 19, 2017","Downloaded this for my Fire tablet and very pleased. Easy to use and easy to find the music I want. Commercials are short and not intrusive."
"May 15, 2017","Every day as I work on glass, Pandora Media has been the answer to my creative needs."
"November 24, 2012","What can I say. I just discovered Pandora and I love being able to have just the music I want. there are some commercials but so what, not anymore than you would get on a radio station,(if as many) and you get just what you want."
"May 19, 2012","this is a good app. it is free, it has a lot of songs, and it is easy to use. Pandora has a lot of songs and genres, too.  this app only has a few downsides, it can only skip 6 times per hour per station, and when you thumbs down a song, a song by the same person plays. that part is slightly annoying.  some people want this app to upgrade, which makes sense. it has a few flaws. But some people don't know that there is already an upgrade for it. it is called Pandora One. it has more songs, genres, and handles skipping and ""artists that you don't like"" very well. this costs $40 a year, but you can have it with all of your devices. you sign in to Pandora with your email, so as long as you you use the same email for all of your devices, you can have Pandora one on all of them. I hope this helps anyone who likes Pandora.  I trust Pandora more than any other radio app. this is because most songs are clean, espicaly if you are searching the right songs/music. thank you for your time."
"June 25, 2016","This app lwets you listen to the songs you love and let's you learn some, as well."
"June 9, 2017","Somewhat difficult to navigate, especially if you're interested in concentrating on a single artist."
"April 16, 2016","I have been using this app for years. It never does me wrong"
"April 29, 2017","We love Pandora. We listen to it all the time whether at home or on the go. It has all the songs of the 40s, 50's to present day. And any kind from Country Western. pop, R&B or what ever. Great app."
"June 13, 2016","I enjoy being able to listen to any radio station and any genre I want. I sing in the Choir at my Church and I can find the songs we are singing and enjoying listening to what I want."
"April 29, 2017","Awesome app. The ability to tailor what I want to listen to is a great feature."
"March 10, 2015","Pandora is a very user friendly radio app. Its song library is huge, and the programming works great. This online music service allows you create custom radio stations based on genres of music, artists, and even specific songs. As you listen, Pandora lets you rate songs by giving a thumbs up or down, or skip tracks altogether. This helps it figure out your likes and dislikes to create a playlist perfectly unique to you. It's important to be an active listener for the algorithm to do its job. Recently, the app added a great new feature, alarm clock. Now you can wake up to your favorite Pandora stations instead of the same old buzzing sounds of your usual alarm clock. I find this app especially helpful when I exercise. I like to listen to upbeat music during a workout but get so tired of preset playlists. This is an app I use daily."
"December 15, 2016","I really enjoy the variety Pandora offers, hate the commercials but still not nearly as bad as regular radio. And finding stations to stream lets me not only enjoy very specific artists but artists associated with them or the time period of the music."
"August 30, 2013","I love it, use it all the time, it's great for music anytime anywhere, on my phone computer whatever!!! Thank you!"
"July 25, 2013","I was very excited to get the Kindle Pandora app. It is very nice to play music while I cook using the online recipes found on Pinterest or various other websites on my Kindle. The only thing I wasn't sure about was how to quit Pandora at first. There is a Quit option, but you must be on the main screen (the one that displays your stations) to utilize it. My Kill app wasn't even able to shut it down. I try to conserve battery life as much as possible. Once I found that Quit option I was much happier with the app."
"December 2, 2015","My daughter gave me a Bose and showed me how to stream it to my Kindle. She then put Pandora on my Kindle. I now can carry my music to any room I'm in. I love Pandora because it has a wide variety of music with few ads and it is free!"
"September 29, 2016","I really enjoy Pandora! I have it on my Phone and now I have it on my Kindle Fire. It's nice to have Pandora playing in the background instead of listening to a Radio.  I highly recommend this App!"
"August 15, 2017","Was a huge fan of Pandora for years - decent price, easy to navigate on screen, good music selections, many positives. But then something bad happened when they likely brought in some kids fresh outta college who decided to dumb it all down by make the computer screen huge with all items spread out towards all edges of your computer screen vs. original Pandora where it was all centered pretty much in the center. Now one has to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function buttons. Plus for this downgrade in features and functions, they started charging more money per month. Plus there IS NO WHERE you can call, talk or email them about your complaints of concerns. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenues anywhere, whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel - NO REFUNDS - you just have to wait till your subscription runs out. So they recently changed it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customers. Maybe it's ok for your cell phone, but on a standing office or home PC there are much better options out there - I've switched to Amazon Music."
"November 11, 2011","After quiting the app my phone becomes sluggish and unresponsive. Only started immediatly after last update. I have an LG Optimus M. Please fix this problem or I and im sure others will have to remove app and go to Slacker..."
"September 30, 2017","I love listening to music throughout the day and Pandora is a great app for it. I have it on multiple devices, my phone, multiple tv's. I like that there's a great variety and you can choose the style that fits you or your mood even. I listen to my 90's alternative when relaxing with the hubby, country through out the day and ( my little secret lol), old school hip hop when I'm alone and dancing in front of the mirror. Don't act like you've never done it lol ! I do wish that you could skip as many songs as you wanted to on the free version tho and of course it goes without saying, I wish it were completely free but I'm not complaining because it's a great app!"
"February 27, 2016","It is very good, I like that I have looked up songs because I could not remember the names of the group that sang the song and it gave me the group's name and the opposite when I have looked up the group for a certain song that I couldn't remember the title of. It has been great been very impressed"
"November 21, 2016","The app allows access to your previously selected stations. Functions well. Making changes to any of your selections is easier by visiting the website, then use the app to access what you have already set up."
"April 17, 2016","I love Pandora!! I love having all of my favorite music with the click of button. I don't have to worry about filling up my phone with downloaded songs anymore! I especially love the new feature that puts all of your liked songs into a playlist. Good job, Pandora. Don't know what I would do without you!"
"December 19, 2015","Pandora saves lives! I listen to Pandora religiously. It adds different music to the station based on things you indicate that you like. It sometimes repeats songs maybe an hour or two after listening to the station but it doesn't happen frequently. I wouldn't know what I would do without this app!"
"July 27, 2016","I use Pandora all day long. I love a diversity in my music and I can change it when ever my mood changes. I use the alarm to set a sleep time, so I fall asleep before it turns off."
"March 8, 2016","Love it , I love the different varietys of music it gives you"
"December 20, 2013","I love Pandora because I can choose the music I want (or don't want) to listen to. I can take it with me when I go other places, and I now have it on my phone."
"March 9, 2017","I love Pandora. They had a really great idea, and an awesome music selection, but the reason I gave the app only 4 stars is because the app does not always open when you click on it, or it looks like it will open then it closes without me ever touching it! I do realize that the app"
"April 12, 2013","I bought me a blue tooth portable speaker ( soundfreq) highly recommend it. Then logged into pandora with my kindle and wallah i have have a wireless speaker system for my backyard bbq. Works just like the pandora on the laptop but now its more mobile with my kindle and if someone doesn't like the music i just type in what they like and there happy. I did have problems getting a specific song but it really didn't matter maybe this is available on the pay pandora i just had the free version. Everyone was impressed with it and now we have music outdoors."
"November 24, 2012","it is really cool and awesome because I can create my own personal stations and listen to music whenever and wherever I want to or need to!"
"January 15, 2013","great free app for music. I have this app on all my devices including my iPhone, iPad and kindle. The only reason I gave this product 4/5 stars is because of the ads and you are only to skip a song a total of 5 or 6 Times per channel a day. Other than that I would recommend this app"
"November 19, 2016","This app is AMAZING but when I tilt my kindle sideways the ads cover the screen too much. The last update helped a lot though!"
"September 22, 2017","I used to love Pandora, have enjoyed it for years and subscribed to Pandora Plus a long time ago. I used to be able to create a station, and if I encountered a song or artist elsewhere that I enjoyed I could add them to the station later using the Add Variety feature. At least I could do it on my desktop app. However, that feature has apparently been removed. So now, once I create a station it's seeds are locked and I am stuck with the option of only liking/disliking the music that the station provides.There is still a Pandora Help page on how to Add Variety, but it's instructions don't work. I will stay with Pandora only because I have so much invested in the stations that I have created. But unless and until they include Add Variety again, I would NOT recommend this to a new user. I only hope that they include it again soon."
"December 6, 2016","I love it an all but I have FULL INTERNET CONNECTION AND IT SAYS, ""Sorry waiting for connection"" Dang it!"
"September 22, 2012","this new update lets you view the lyrics and I love it! And they play the same ad over and over because that's who payed for it duh !"
"September 26, 2014","By now anyone with a smart device should know or had tried the Pandora app. If you have not, you have been missing out on a ton of high quality, 100% free music. I have been using this App for years, since my first iPhone 3G. This has been by far my favorite music app.  + Free! Who doesn't like free?! + High quality sound. Even with a weak signal, Pandora plays like these songs are stored in my phone. + A wide variety of stations to choose from. Rock, country, hip hop, R&B, jazz, classical, electronic, disney, and even music from movies! Also by year, the 70s, 80s, 90s, latest hits, Pandora has it all. + Create your own group of music. If you only favor a few bands, even from different genre, you can combine them in a group so it will only play the type that you enjoy listening. + Thumb up and down system. If there is a song you like, thumb it up and it will play more often or more of the same artist. Thumb down and it will never be played again. + Alarm clock! With the latest update Pandora offers your favorite station as your alarm clock. This will ensure to get you moving and not hit that snooze button! + No commercial or interruption! This could just be me, I use the same account for my mobile device and my pc. When I listen on my pc there is zero commercial. On my phone however there is ads once in awhile. Not sure what triggers it. But the ads are always short and happens every few songs.  Give it a try and you won't regret it. I have been using this for years and even after trying others, I prefer Pandora."
"December 5, 2016","Won't let me sign up...age discrimination?"
"May 15, 2017","Sound quality on a kindle is not that great. Also, if you stop thumbing, it shuts off."
"August 15, 2017","Absolutely the best source of music streaming. Not that there aren't other good ones... Pandora is just a little above all of the others. Pandora gives you 3 choices of service level. I recently switched from ""some"" commercials to the lower of two commercial free options. All 3 are good to listen to, but I think I will be at this ""mid-level"" of service for some time to come. I really appreciate the ability to listen off line when there is no good streaming source available."
"July 14, 2016","I like Pandora because it allows me to select my favorite artists and also the suggestions of artists that are similar to the ones that I selects which introduce me to new artists."
"January 1, 2017","I love music and I love love love this app! Definitely recommend!!! It works very good I just wish that you could save songs from it and create like an album with the songs you saved so then you can listen to the music you like without needing WiFi. I would really love to listen to the music when I'm on a road trip and my kindle is not connected. Other than that I am extremely satisfied with Pandora!"
"May 9, 2017","I absolutely love this APP. I downloaded right to my home screen so I have easy access to get to it faster . Great tutorials to teach you how to use this app and so much fun . i love all the genras of music to choose from.  If this review has helped you in any way please check ""yes"" below…. Many Thanks! I would recommend this product to friends and family."
"May 30, 2017","This is just plain stupid! You can't even log in whithout it saying ""please enter a vallid email adress."" So if this is quite glitch or whayever then could you fix it."
"June 21, 2017","Enjoy the musiv"
"May 26, 2017","Pandora Great music app, one of my favorite."
"March 14, 2017","Thankyou, Pandora!"
"June 30, 2016","What can I say this app rocks. No pun intended. Pandora has the capability to understand your music choices and with that they get your music preferences down and provide music that you will enjoy."
"October 19, 2016","I love the fact that you get to create different staions and you choose what you want to listen to according to your mood i think."
"May 3, 2017","I love pandora, my music, the availability I love it all!"
"June 21, 2016","In my opinion this app works well just try it if you haven't before and you may like it also."
"November 29, 2016","Great app used it for many years"
"June 7, 2017","I've been a Pandora One customer for four years. Today I cancelled my subscription. Why? Because they went from allowing two devices to stream at one time to just one device at a time. No notice. No email or anything explaining the change. Just BAM! Sorry, you can't do that anymore. When I contacted them they didn't seem to overly care that they made this change without any notice. They were willing to log me out of any and all devices and force me to change my password but to be able to stream on two devices at the same time meant paying for another account (at a higher rate). I would now have TWO accounts. One paying the same I'd paid for the last four years: $3.99 and the new account paying MORE at $4.99. No thanks."
"July 1, 2017","The app said it was trying to connect, when I had full bars. Why is it doing this?"
"May 31, 2014","Pandora lets You choose who you listen to and what you listen to. It also allows you to eliminate the Songs, Artist, or Genre that you don't like.. Plus, You can create many different Stations for your listening pleasure by simply typing an Artist name or the Genre. Soon after ""Pandora"" will start to recognize your personal taste in music and play similar Artist, Songs,or Styles of music for you, but ultimately YOU decide what stays and what goes by clicking ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"", or if your not in the mood for a particular song, you'll always have the option to just ""Skip it"". I Love ""Pandora""! and You will too. I hope this review was helpful."
"October 31, 2016","I like the fact that I can choose my own music and I can also save them"
"April 25, 2012","If you are familiar with Pandora, then I can tell you that this app is a good version of the web based Pandora for your phone. Once you log in, it syncs with your account and shows all of your stations.  Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.  You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour (although it is not unlimited).  However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $4.99 monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""  There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for $0.99. That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.  This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are looking for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.  The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on (for example, only on weekdays). It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.  There is also a ""sleep timer"" that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval (currently 15, 30, or 60 minutes) so that the app doesn't play music all night while you sleep."
"February 25, 2016","5 stars! I love this music app!!"
"April 9, 2017","Less expensive than slacker. I like that there is no DJ. Not as detail as slacker, I just keep it on certain settings though and I am Fine. The realaxation station which I use at Night is excellent. I never heard music like that before. During the day I just set it to Led Zepplin and it plays music I like. The smooth jazz station was good also."
"August 9, 2016","After trying several other on line music apps to use on my Kindle, this one seems to be the best. The others regularly would lose their connection and take a long time to reconnect to the internet (if they'd reconnect at all). Pandora seems to have a very strong connection. Pandora also has a very extensive collection of all genres of music. It also doesn't inundate you with repetitive advertisements and announcements. Pandora has proven itself to be an excellent way to have background music throughout my house."
"November 13, 2011","I have been a long time user of Pandora on the web, blackberry and Android. Recently this app has not been allowing me to hear entire songs. a song will start and play for a short amount of time before abruptly skipping to the next. This now happens consistently and I never get to hear an entire song. I'm very disappointed and will be deleting this app after submitting this review."
"October 15, 2016","WHAT A SCAM PANDORA IS !!!! It is literally impossible to cancel my subscription!"
"June 14, 2016","I love this app! So easy to use! And free is always awesome!  I love to have it playing all day. I love the mix that Pandora generates.  I can listen to whatever style of music matches my mood that day!"
"April 7, 2017","Pandora is a great music player. I like the selection of music they play for me in the four or five genres I play the most. There are a few advertisements per hour in the free version and that's tolerable. I gave them only three stars because the new user interface is absolutely horrible. Pandora must have been compelled to make things move and make information disappear from view until you direct the cursor over the pictures to make the information visible again. Why? The old interface was simple, clear and functional. Some inexperienced kid out of college must have needed a job and Pandora hired the kid to make the GUI as hard to use as possible. But, the music is good. They don't make it, just play it."
"November 24, 2012","cause it has everything i want. i would reccomend to everyone. i have tried other ones and they play what i like."
"July 19, 2017","Besides the commercials its a great music app that will lead you to like the other alike artists and it wont play the songs you give a thumbs down to"
"October 29, 2016","Pandora has an amazing selection of radio stations and I'm so glad we can further edit them to our preferences! But I am saddened by the fact that if my kindle screen goes idle the music consistently skips unlike when the screen is active where it might skip once in an hour. Also different than my cell phone which doesn't skip at all. If it weren't for that issue this would likely be a five star!!!!"
"March 1, 2017","I couldn't live without Pandora. I subscribed. Best entertainment value around."
"April 20, 2016","I use Pandora with my Amazon Echo more than any other streaming service. They seem to have the fewest commercials and play some great artists that relate well to the station I've chosen. To be honest I've only downloaded the app because I don't want to drag my Echo into the steamy bathroom. I use the Pandora app to pair my tablet with a waterproof speaker I listen to in the shower. I've created all my stations already with the Echo so although it works just fine all I really do with the app is scroll until I find what I want to listen to for that shower, start it playing and then walk away. It does what I need it to do and the music it picks no matter what 'station' I'm listening to is truly top notch. In a nutshell, I really don't do a lot with the app but it does what I need quite well."
"September 15, 2017","I've been a fan of Pandora for years with my computer, my phone, and now my tablet. I get to pick the music, even if we have to go back to the 1940s to get the songs and bands that play real music, not just noise."
"June 7, 2017","Pandora is great for customizing and variety but the commercials are annoying lol still better than FM radio though!!"
"August 27, 2013","I enjoy having this on my kindle, fun to listen to music while reading my email or checking out facebook"
"September 1, 2017","Omg Pandora is so cool you can listen to all different types of music and it is just so awesome"
"April 18, 2014","I use other music services too, but Pandora is a go to. Don't forget, that it is enjoyable to get specific music you like to listen too. It seems this will be a standard now.  In order to preserve all these services, don't forget to shut it down when your not listening. Mind you, they don't pay a lot of money to the music industry per song, but those costs can build up. Act accordingly, and services like this will get better and better. Or go out of business."
"August 8, 2015","This was very easy to upload to my Amazon Fire Phone and my Fire 7. Pandora is my favorite music app. No matter what kind of music you like or what mood you are in, you are sure to find music that you love! I love that you can customize your music listening to your liking. I like all kinds of music from James Taylor to Metallica to Bruno Mars and with Pandora, I can set it up to listen to whatever I am feeling that day! I highly recommend this for your music app!"
"May 31, 2017","Its the dumbest radio app ever, when I'm using my aunts internet (its rlly good internet) it says ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" When I'm at a laundry mat, ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" My house, ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" My parents house ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" This app is the crapiest app ever. I don't think you should get this app. IHeartRaido is way better than this. Fix it. I wish I could give this 0 stars."
"March 30, 2016","Best music app by far. Easy to create channels for all types of music genres and navigation back and forth between them. I eventually purchased the upgrade so that I didn't have to deal with listening to ads between songs. I highly recommend taking that route if you plan on using this as your primary source for listening to music."
"July 7, 2016","I love Pandora! Great Channels, great music, everything! But, some songs are super laggy and other times the apps closes on me and stops playing music. Is there were no problems, I would rate this app five star."
"November 8, 2017","Don't know why this is here on Amazon, unless they are trying to compare Amazon Prime music with Pandora. OK, I have been a member/customer of Pandora for 9 years, and once quit using because of too many ads, when they quit the distasteful number of ads on free I went back and next decided to go to Pandora-One and recently went even further to Pandora ultimate with no ads at all. I love it and use it daily on every device I own. I have no complaints. The music is clear and good EQ, perfect for headphones, all Bluetooth speakers and love the stories of the lives of artists."
"September 29, 2016","Pandora is my first streaming music experience. The more I use it, the more I dislike it. Its song library is extremely limited compared to other providers. There is very little variety and you hear the same songs over and over if you pick two stations with similar genres. Buy Pandora One and you still CANNOT skip an unlimited number of songs. This is total crap. Whats premium if you can control the content. Don't subscribe and you have to listen to lame ads where people repeat their phone number over and over and over. Keeping the app as a back up, but moving on to something with a larger library, less repetition and more robust features."
"October 19, 2015","The Kindle Edition of Pandora is good when it works, but that isn't often. The app closes on me frequently, especially when I have a good rotation of songs going. I do not use it on my Kindle Fire as often as I would like because of this. I've updated my device and the app itself and have seen absolutely no improvement on performance. Hopefully, this issue can be resolved in the near future, because I use my Kindle Fire quite often and I would love not to have to juggle two devices just to listen so music."
"November 24, 2012","this is a great music app. It allows you to customise the stations you wish to listen to artist. It is nice to listen to music without interruptions."
"March 6, 2016","I'll be honest Pandora is good at what it does. But it has gone down in quality with all the adds seeing as how every two or so songs I have to deal with 4 adds each time so yeah it's a good app but do you think it's worth paying or waiting through the adds."
"August 8, 2017","We have been big fans of Pandora since it was released. We love picking an artist and letting the algorithm make really good selections based on that initial artist selection. Also, the application is portable across devices making it ideal for listening anytime. Couple this app with a bluetooth speaker and voila you have your tunes for any occasion."
"June 23, 2013","Music is my passion. I love many genres. However, it was difficult to know how to access new music. By creating my personal stations on Pandora, I have been introduced to many new artists that are now part of my musical world. I listen to Pandora every day, and am constantly surprised by new and beautiful songs and instrumentals. I then have new materials for creating my own Playlists, when I purchase music. Pandora is truly my Magic Box. What a gift! I subscribe by the month at minimal cost and it's worth every penny!"
"February 2, 2017","This app is so cool! You dont need wifi so you can listen to you fav songs anywhere!! This is my favorite app👌😁😆"
"April 3, 2016","I LOVE THIS APP!!! It is amazing. You can make any station you want. Now that they have Thumbprint radio it is 10x better. Thumbprint radio is a station that only plays the songs that you have liked. It's amazing! I very much recommend this app!"
"June 12, 2017","I've always loved Pandora. So its awesome to me. But sometimes it stops in the middle of nowhere. I'm like "" Really"". But I still love it and you should too."
"September 8, 2013","I was introduced to Pandora when I bought my Roku about 2-3 years ago. I am so tired of traditional radio, hearing the same old stuff from 40 years ago, even current music, they play to death. With Pandora, even if you chose a musical group from 40 years ago, you can hear all of their tracks, not just the ones they play on traditional radio. You also will hear musical groups from the same Genre. You can chose any group you like. Pandora offers an upgrade without commercials, even if you get free Pandora, the commercials/ads are not that long, and you are back to hearing your favorite music. I recommend Pandora to everyone!"
"October 14, 2017","This is my first time trying Pandora I really like it as soon as you touch the icon it pops up and it starts playing your music and I love that you have so many choices to choose from someone calls that call ends and it comes right back on I love that I know there's lots of other options and I haven't had it long enough to actually get into that an like read all about it I plan on doing that because you can actually like download songs and take them like anywhere with you so anywhere you're at you have your favorite music and I love that too try it out you'll love it too"
"December 3, 2016","I love Pandora you can get so many stations!"
"January 18, 2013","Pandora has a genre of songs for any music lover and the best part is that it syncs to my smartphone, computer and Roku. If I sign in on what ever device, there is my list! Great selection of 70's rock, contemporary Christian and Cool Jazz."
"February 5, 2017","I use Echo to access Pandora. I have asked it to play several different genres of music and it always responds with a nice variety of songs and different artists. When I ask for a particular artist it plays only songs by that artist. My only complaint is that the volume control don't control the volume of commercials at the same level as the music.. The commercials are always louder."
"June 1, 2016","I love the variety of music that you can get with Pandora, and I especially love the fact that you can set the station to whoever your favorite artist is. This is so easy and convenient. Pandora has to be one of my all-time favorite applications."
"August 8, 2015","I truly enjoy this app for music. I choose what I want to hear, and when I want to hear it. I have the capability to set music stations that I like the way I like. I have stations to get me going, stations for background, and for falling to sleep. The commercials are not a deterrent for me, there are less than the radio. Which by the way I never listen to now, Pandora all the time."
"June 18, 2017","Great streaming channel with a wide variety of music."
"September 7, 2017","I remember when this app first came out I freaking loved it it was the future but about three years ago I switched to Spotify and I've been there ever since. Anyways my friend brought up Pandora the other day so I thought I'd see what Pandora has been up to. What happened to them? Since I left Pandora I've gotten a promotion gotten a raise I've even got a new car and my home is even smarter now while Pandora has only updated the page look that's it a new shinny page."
"February 26, 2017","THANK YOU FOR THIS I NEEDED IT :) :)"
"June 10, 2017","Great! You get just what you want, when you want it unlike AM or FM radio."
"August 26, 2012","I love the Pandora app. I can customize it to play the type of music that I want to listen to. I can see the name of the songs and who is singing them complete unlike listening to the radio. No call letters of the radio station being blared at me every minute...just music. You can select whatever stations that you like and give a thumbs up rating to the songs you love to keep them playing when you want to hear them in the future."
"December 26, 2012","I love love love Pandora & have used it for a few years now!! You can't get much better than free, but may consider upgrading to Pandora 1, especially since I use Pandora on my Kindle now & not just on my computer. The ad's that pop up are a bit annoying. When you play Pandora on your laptop or computer they may play a quick add after every 5-6 or sometimes as long as every 8-10 songs but on the kindle ad's pop up almost one after the other. If you hit the X to x out of one, another pops up almost immediately :/ mildly annoying but what can you expect for free, huh?"
"December 12, 2014","I admit that I cannot remember the exact timeframe that I discovered Pandora, but I believe that it was sometime around summer or autumn 2011 when my husband played music from the app during one of our quiet moments together. I enjoy that there is a wide range of stations and music genres that one can listen to. I’m open-minded when it comes to willingness to listen to various types of music. Right now, the top three music stations that I am listening to on Pandora the most are chillout, electronica, and indie dance, although I have to humbly credit recently finding out about indie dance from a public relations specialist named heather whaling of geben communication- who listed indie dance being one of their fave stations online. Sometimes I go ahead and also shuffle the over 20 plus radio stations that are set in my Pandora profile in order to listen to satisfy my eclectic tastes in music. Many of my online music purchases have been influenced by many of the songs and artists I heard on Pandora."
"September 23, 2013","Pandora is very easy to use and users have access to a fantastic selection of stations, music, etc. And it can be used even when local radio stations close down for the night. Sound quality, going through my Kindle Fire HD, is easily comparable to a good quality portable FM Radio.  Still, I do not expect to use it very much. I mostly use my Kindle at home and I prefer my home stereo system for music. But it is nice to have in case I have it with me in an appropriate environment."
"May 3, 2017","Love Pandora! Listen to it every day! Love that I can listen to different genre's of music depending on my mood."
"January 4, 2013","It's the perfect radio, I highly recommend having this app! Just watch out if u don't have unlimited data and its all good. Great for anyone who loves music."
"October 29, 2017","Who doesn't like Pandora? I've had it for almost 10 years so of course I had to add it to my new Kindle. Its FREE, and I love that I can have my own personal stations filled with music I like. I have a different station for every genre of music or mood I'm in. The thumbs up or down feature is really nice so I never have to hear a song I don’t like. Sure I could pay a fee to have the ads removed, but they only run about every 5th or 6th song and they’re short, not at all like on TV. So its worth it to me to have it for free."
"June 22, 2017","Excellent"
"May 23, 2017","Love listening to Pandora."
"May 30, 2017","works great on my mobile device."
"December 16, 2012","I like this Pandora app for Kindle. It plays fine & I have not had any problem with force closing. The only thing I don't like is the pop-ups during play. It doesn't interfere with the player, I just don't care for it."
"May 16, 2017","I really really enjoy"
"February 7, 2017","I enjoy Pandora, but it could definitely be better. I do not like the loud commercials. They are extremely irritating so I either turn off the sound or turn off Pandora when they come on. Even more disconcerting is when I am listening to Jose Cura a nd other tenors, I suddenly get hit with Heavy Metal! Definitely not in my comfort zone."
"May 29, 2017","Great musuc, whatever you like theybhave it!"
"February 28, 2017","Pandora Rocks!"
"July 23, 2017","Hard to keep on track of songs you like unless you are right there to give thumbs up or down. With some artists once one "" off "" type song get in your set, a lot of other strays get mixed in. Also, even when you do thumbs down on some songs, they still play, but you will get an error message."
"October 13, 2017","Easy and love it!"
"July 22, 2017","i love this it is so many different ways to listen to my kind of music so many selections of songs i created my own music station i wish there was a way you could use your station as a ringtone every time your phone rings a different song would play that would be amazing"
"February 16, 2017","This app is not like others. It allows you to sing along with the lyrics option. In my opinion that is great."
"July 20, 2017","Love music!!! Love Pandora!!! The best music selection from oldies to today's greatest hits. Whatever my mood is Pandora will oblige. My brother is in a nursing home and wanted to listen to some Al Green. He is very old school, does not know anything about streaming or apps. As soon as I hit play, ""It was ON!"" My brother was singing, his roommate was singing, I was swaying and singing and even some of the nurses were swaying and singing. We had a BLAST!!! Nursing homes, are depressing places. But not that day; there was lot of spirit lifting going on. Thank you Pandora for having the perfect selection of music."
"August 9, 2017","The playlists can range from outstanding to complete garbage. Also, there are way too many ads. Pandora has fallen far."
"December 22, 2012","This apps works great I can listen to music and play order and chaos online. It only stops because you have bad wifi and the commercial happen like every 7 songs to me ands there only 30 sec. I love it I can listen to all my favorite bands like The Ghost Inside, Parkway Drive, Carpathian, Stick to your Guns, and Killswitch engage. Get it who doesn't like FREE MUSIC"
"December 1, 2014","Love Pandora. I can listen to all types of music. I have at least 20 different styles of music and keep adding to when I hear something I like. I love to put it on shuffle when I am reading and listen to everything from meditative and instrumental to oriental and classical. Money well spent."
"August 29, 2013","This was a fantastic app until one day it decided to stop working. Nothing more than a blue Pandora screen now :("
"January 9, 2013","Pandora is a great radio app.IMO much better than mobile Spotify!!Just type in a favorite artist or song & a station(s) will be created for you.As you rate the songs it will personalize the selections over time.I'm very happy I installed this app.Best thing is you can put your device in standby & the music still plays while saving battery life.Sound quality is FANTASTIC!!!  Enjoy.....Joe  Update:Noticed something that really pees me off!! In between songs or after ads I noticed songs listed as played that never played.You can't go back & play them,you can rate them.Just a bit aggravating when a sucky song comes on & a great song was skipped(not by me)!!! I still love the app!!(tunein is better though)"
"February 28, 2014","Pandora was recommended to me by a friend, so I downloaded it to my Kindle fire. Quick and easy download as usual for the fire...very easy to start navigating around the app with no real instruction needed. I did not use the instructional ""get started"" guide that is provided. I quickly created some stations based on my many moods and am pleased to say that it has become my favorite source of music at work! I use the free version and do not find the ads to be too intrusive. Well worth the download!"
"May 20, 2017","Love the wide variety of music and options!"
"June 18, 2016","Its cool and all just there's no search it only has a few songs I like it but it needs some more things to it. Spotify is way better!"
"September 6, 2017","The Pandora app sounds great on my Kindle Fire HD. I prefer Pandora for streaming because I like several genre of music, including jazz and Brazilian. Pandora makes accessing the sounds and instruments I like easy. Pandora definitely targets well."
"August 16, 2013","I've never been able to get this app to actually play music. It simply opens up a screen with the logo and does nothing else. Not sure whats going on."
"October 26, 2016","Just letting everyone know that Summer Hits of the 90s is the best station on here"
"October 28, 2016","I love the Pandora app!"
"December 29, 2012","Many prior reviewers have bemoaned the number of ads on Pandora stations, to which I reply: So? The ads are less frequent, less lengthy, and less disruptive than on a typical Clear Channel broadcast station. Considering the number and range of songs Pandora provides, and that royalties consume much more of digital radio's revenue than broadcast, I don't begrudge them paying for themselves. Since the ads aren't loud, I can handle a few interruptions.  I'm more impressed by the fact that Pandora offers a wide array of music in nearly every genre, including music too edgy or dangerous for conglomerate-owned media outlets. Especially for those of us who live in the hinterlands, Pandora provides an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with music we would never otherwise encounter. I've been able to broaden my exposure to indie rock, international and ethnic music, daring composers, and innovative singer-songwriters.  And getting it for my smartphone has been a real boost. I'm able to connect the provider to my car radio, the stereo at work, or my headphones, and carry my innovative music around with me. The sound is clear and translates well onto larger speakers, meaning I can enjoy it on my commute or my morning exercise regimen without having to accept diminished quality. Getting this for my phone has been a real blessing, one I intend to continue enjoying."
"October 2, 2013","I'll attempt to not repeat what other reviews have said because there are nuances to Pandora that go beyond a convenient way to listen to the music you love.  The first thing I love is the way artists whose work is related to your favorites that you specify in channels are slipped in. I have discovered more musicians (and albums) that I would have never thought of on my own through that feature.  I also love that I can easily peruse a mini biography of the artist on any currently playing song, as well as features of the track itself. For example, listening to bassist Ron Carter's album titled Saguaro I discovered that the key features of the track for Piccolo include block chords on the piano and it's in a minor key. That information cues me to listen to those more carefully, which is a boon for musicians.  Another feature with which I am currently experimenting is the connect-to-facebook link that will not only alert friends to what I am listening to (although I have that hidden using facebook's privacy settings), but a monthly summary of my listening habits published on my timeline. That I do find useful!  The ads can be somewhat tiresome, but when I weight that minor inconvenience against the way Pandora's insertion of related music into my channel plays I can live with it with a smile. I have been exposed to a much wider range of music and artists than I ever was before Pandora came along, and this app is the key.  For the record this review is of version 4.1.2, which is the latest as of the date of this review. Features may change, obviously, so take this date and version into consideration as you read this review."
"July 3, 2013","I am technically ignorant and was very glad my children showed me how to have music at the touch of my hands anytime I wanted."
"November 3, 2014","Not a bad free music app. You can select albums, artists etc to listen to. Shuffle all of them or choice just tone to play. You have no control over specific songs though. Also they throw 'similar music' onto the station you are listening too. Sometimes it is great, others can be disappointing. However if you want only the one album of specific song this does not work so well. If you do not like wha tis playing, you are limited to how many songs you can skip. And there are a fair share of ad interruptions. The other downside is that it takes a bit ti shut down the app and are constantly sending update notifications and thus far I have not figured out a way to stop them. But regardless, this is free and can still be great. I use this on my phone and kindle so that when I am cleaning, exercising or outside I can enjoy my favorite music and overall there are less interruptions here than on a live radio station. They have a good variety of music on it but seem limited to US artists so far mostly."
"September 7, 2014","What happened to Pandora?? I'm just cruising along with life when all of a sudden I realize how times have changed and Spotify seems bigger in the market than Pandora. I feel like I just got old at the thought of how things have changed.  But, this app holds up respectably in terms of ease of use and ability to stream music without lag. I admit I have become more of a Spotify user myself, but for old times' sake, Pandora is just as great of a music streaming service. The app performs decently as well."
"July 8, 2012","I don't get all these comments about commercials every other song or other annoying things. This app works great for me on my Kindle Fire! I hardly ever hear a commercial- at most one per hour. I put in an artist that I love to be the station and so far it has given me a great variety. Also, I have not had problems with songs messing up when I am using another app- maybe the occasional tiny pause but that's it. Overall, I love this app and see no problems with it. :)"
"September 30, 2017","I have had Pandora Music Service for a number of years and am a regular subscriber. I think Pandora is the best music service on the market. Music choice, ease of use, especially the ""quick mix option"", and the annual cost make it virtually unbeatable."
"November 6, 2013","I'd never be able to broaden my horizons if not for Pandora. I don't even bother with owning an archive anymore. However, the song selection is a bit limited, and some of the hoops Pandora has to jump through to keep its numerous license-holders happy end up putting odd quirks in the program. It will never be Spotify, but it's not enough to detract from the program, and Pandora One is dirt-cheap compared to other advertisement-free tiers in other programs.  Despite any possible shadows of disadvantage, Pandora has changed my relationship with music."
"August 23, 2017","It didn't take very long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up, a few thumbs down, and I have hours of the music that I want to hear (not what a local station thinks that I want to hear). The work goes faster and easier with Pandora - yard work, house work, and even re-roofing the house. Yes, 14 months spent re-roofing the house while listening to Pandora! It has my thumbs up."
"May 8, 2016","If you like music you can't beat this app. It plays only the types of music that you like to hear. If a choice of a song is not to your liking just give it a thumbs down and it is gone. I chose four different genres of music when I first got the app and listened for two hours and only snubbed two songs. I felt like it read my mind as to what I would play from my personal record collection. The ads are not that frequent and do not last long either. Get this app now and you won't be sorry."
"April 8, 2012","Pandora has an organized layout and also you can thumb down and up songs also pause and more. For Kindle Fire you can shut your screen off then power the screen on on a commercial video and come back to the next song!!"
"July 16, 2017","dont pay for xm/serius when you have pandora for free ! much better when you can control your music with likes,and dislikes. and if you want more control you can pay $5 a month more and get it all ! luv it , luv it, can't get enuf of it !"
"February 1, 2017","I absolutely love pandora. I use everyday and I don't mind the advertisements which is why I would pay for the no adds deal. Now since they update the get more skip buy watch a video is more pleasing to my enjoyment."
"June 29, 2016","This app makes it easy to listen to music and I find it very helpful:)"
"January 2, 2017","Although it's free, it could be very annoying when your working hard for a couple of hours and enjoying the music, but then it shuts off to ask if you're still listening!!! Good music, and sounds like a radio with commercials, but stop asking if we're still listening, someone will eventually turn it off or change it to their liking."
"March 23, 2017","great music selection"
"March 15, 2016","I really enjoy Pandora very much. The only problem I've had is very occasional dead air for a minute here and there. I dislike the commercials. I have a Bluetooth Speaker and I get to bring Pandora with me wherever I go! Great for gatherings of any sort. I also use it as background for my Meditation classes. An amazingly huge amount of music, all genres, are available. Love it!"
"June 9, 2016","I love taking my music where ever I go! A lot easier than I thought it would be to find what I would like. Even the commercials aren't as bad as you find on the radio."
"June 5, 2017","I like Pandora to play when I'm cooking or sleeping, but it sometimes is hit or miss with the play selections."
"March 22, 2017","I gave this music app five stars because of the wide range of stations and diversity of songs provided and unlike YouTube when you leave the app the songs don't stop they continue to play. One good thing about Pandora is that the adds aren't as bad they don't show up a lot. Thanks Pandora for the best free music app anyone has to offer"
"May 30, 2017","When u select your stations they play a great variety. I can go from Madonna to Eydie Gorme to the Doors to Patsy Cline. I do not like that you cannot repeat or restart a song."
"May 31, 2016","Same as the website, easy to use, my son (7yo) has his music playing non-stop on his kindle at home.  If my review was helpful, please hit ""yes""!"
"May 17, 2016","I've used Pandora for many years. It's one of the only websites I remember off bat when getting ready to hear some music off line. The best site, it looked like from the best search engine and now my perspective. I believe I chose the best one. It's not complicated to navigate or anything. I built a playlist on the video hosting site, youtube.com, bases off the best songs pandora.com was playing for me. It's called Christine's Music Playlist. It has a link and over 400 songs that are all favorites. Pandora really is the best of the web."
"March 9, 2017","Everyone get it"
"September 28, 2016","I really like the variety of music. I have mine on shuffle so I will have a 60's song, then a country, then rock and roll! It is great, except of course the commercials, but there are like gobs of them!"
"October 3, 2017","Just a great, easy to use service."
"November 12, 2016","I love the new logo"
"October 4, 2017","With being able to listen and at the same time make your own channels"
"February 3, 2013","How long have I been listening to Pandora? Since before it WAS Pandora and it was MSN Music, that's how long ago I've been a fan! I realize that there are other streaming music channels out there but when you achieve perfection, WHY switch?  Thanks to Pandora, my work and personal life is so much richer. I have over 52 different channels on Pandora, from Patti Page, to Lionel Hampton, Pink Martini, Nils Frahm, Windham Hill, to 5 different Christmas stations (which I'm embarrassed to admit, I listen to throughout the year!). I have learned SO much more about the different genres that I enjoy, from Pop, Jazz, Blues, Alternative, Classical that Pandora should proudly take a bow, just on the education factor!  If you go just a hare's breath beyond the standard listening feature, there's a wee box of ""arrows"" that you click so you can find out 1) Lyrics to most songs; 2) About the Artist; 3) WHY Pandora is using that particular artist i.e. ""Accoustic rhythm piano; intricate phrasing."" You also have the ability to ""Bookmark"" any song that you like, so you don't have to scramble for a pen/paper to remember ""Who WAS that awesome artist?""  And, if you take the small effort to ""Thumb's Up/Down"" a song every now and then, Pandora can broaden their knowledge of your music and they add more songs of that ilk to your stations. Thank you, Pandora!  Because I have a Zune membeship, what I do is take my bookmarked songs/artists and then investigate them further through Zune, usually downloading the entire album. A person can't be everywhere at one time and by listening to Pandora, I discover the ENTIRE world of music, not just the tiny part I know.  And ""Yes!"", I'm a paid member for Pandora.One, a yearly Christmas gift I give myself and Pandora, applauding what they give to me, daily. Frankly, what else can you buy for less than a dime a day that delivers so much? :)"
"September 21, 2016","What's not to love? Pick your music choices, use shuffle for a mix up and there is your evening's background music."
"March 3, 2017","works great"
"July 13, 2017","Pandora is a great music app. Even though it doesn't play a specific song it allows you to pick a specific music category that you enjoy listening to. I use it often and because it's free it's even better."
"January 24, 2017","I have been listening Pandora for years, I think is the best site for the variety, versatility and you can use your profile from any device, and plus the free version is very good for me. I would recommend it"
"March 8, 2014","THIS IS THE GREATEST OFFER FOR LISTENING TO YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC. I WANTED TO HEAR MUSIC LIKE BONNIE RAIT AND BY SELECTING THIS ARTIST ON PANDORA, IT PLAYED HER AND MUSICIANS LIKE HER AND IT WAS GREAT. THEN I WANTED TO HEAR SOME SOFT EASY LISTENING PIANO MUSIC TO READ BY AND SELECTED FLOYD CRAMMER AND YES PANDORA, BROUGHT UP FLOYD CRAMMER AND OTHER GREAT PIANIST. MY HUSBAND ENJOYS MUSICIAN LIKE HANK, WAYLON & WILLY SO, NOW HE CAN HEAR HIS FAVORITE MUSICIANS AND OTHERS LIKE THESE ARTIST. WE HAVE HAD PANDORA FOR A MONTH AND WE BOTH ENJOY LISTENING TO OUR PANDORA. WE TURN IT ON AND LISTENING TO IT ALL DAY AS WE GO ABOUT OUR DAY AT HOME. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
"January 27, 2017","I love this app, I use it all the time! Great way to listen to the music you love. Love all the music selection"
"September 3, 2016","I had a phone, tablet, laptop stolen. I get new ones, log in except for here never asked if had an account. I had to re pay for what I had. So not sure if will stay with it. I like my MP3 anyway. Did like the music."
"April 29, 2017","The new site is awful! It is significantly more complicated to use, especially when editing stations. This now requires a four step process instead of one. How stupid is that?!?!? The new site wastes so much space that could be used for navigation purposes. Music and cost is the same, but the new site STINKS!!! It's like going back in time 10 years."
"January 25, 2017","I really like Pandora, but I'd like it better if I were able to choose which songs I wanted to hear instead of having to listen to only those chosen for me."
"April 5, 2014","I came on this site by accident and fell in love with it. I love to listen to music and there is so much to pick from it is hard to make up my mind. There is something for everyone from oldies from the 40's and 50's to current hits; instrumental to vocal to show songs. Most are free which does come with some ads which can be disconcerting because they come in when you least expect them, but there are not many. For anyone who likes music this is a good purchase."
"September 4, 2017","Pandora is the best effort yet to allow each of us to be our own disc jockey. Take an artist, a song or a genre and use Pandora to build a total environment and system of sound. Simply sublime!"
"February 28, 2013","Disowned to Kindle Fire only displays the background. No functional use. Guess I have to wait and download at another time. That sucks!"
"September 6, 2017","I have subscribed to Pandora for years. It is great to have on our Amazon ""Alexa"". All I have to do is open the station I want, ""Alexa, Hillsong from Pandora"". Then as I listen to the songs I tell Alexa, I like this song or I don't like this song"". If it is saved as a ""like"" or a ""dislike"" I am building my own station."
"July 22, 2017","Very cool. I remember the days when you had to buy every piece of music you wanted to listen to, even if only once or twice. To have custom radio stations of your own to call on is lovely."
"April 29, 2017","""Serial"" podcasts and ""This American Life"". All the different channels. Very pleased."
"September 6, 2017","The Pandora app is pretty easy to use without getting the premium version, however, as Pandora seeks to become more profitable, there are more annoying commercials that interrupt the mood."
"April 18, 2017","Love this app - use it to stream music which saves space on my devices as I don't have to download music."
"September 20, 2017","didn't know I ordered it but I do like Pandora"
"May 20, 2013","I got this app years ago and loved it right away. This app tailors the music to your liking. Unlike other music apps this one is don't just play the same genera it goes a level deeper and plays the same like arts. For example if you like rap music and select Ice Cube radio it won't just play gangsta rap music it will play west coast rap music because Ice Cube is a west coast rapper. The only downside is now this app is getting popular, being added to cars etc... so there are now commercials after 4-5 songs. You have to purchase it to be commercial free."
"March 17, 2017","Great app"
"August 30, 2013","Listen to it all the time. Love forming my channels into the perfect mix. I like the random quality of a music mix when I don't know what is coming on next."
"July 30, 2017","I like several types of good music and have created one or more stations for each of them (depending upon what I am in the mood for). I have used each of the stations often enough to indicate many ""thumbs up"" recordings that I enjoy on that station. In addition to hearing my ""thumbs up"" favorites, I also am introduced to other, similar recordings and artists on each station that I also enjoy discovering and adding to my list. Charles McKay"
"December 16, 2013","Love this app. Works great on a Droid X. We have paid the monthly fee so we don't get commercials… That’s the way to go if you listen to Pandora for any length of time. It has lots of features. Share the track you are currently listening to. Sleep timer function to shut off automatically. Bookmark a current track you are listening to. Also, an option to buy the track if you like it that much. Also, you can touch the picture and another screen opens from behind and allows you information about the artist, features of the track and lyrics. THAT is very cool. Allows you to create as many stations as you like. If you don't like a song in your genre then ""thumb it down"" and it should never play again. I think what I love the most about Pandora is it plays songs LIKE the play list I create and I find new songs to love all the time."
"September 29, 2017","The app works well. No complaints yet."
"March 12, 2014","I turn on Pandora from my Tablet and use a jambox for the sound via Bluetooth.. I am a subscriber and pay my monthly fee. Pandora has a tendency to stop and then I have to restart. Sometimes it is really bad. (I have no problems with Radio Paradise). Mostly it is on shuffle and in spite of the fact that I have not put an arrow on Christmas songs Pandora manages to slip one in here and there. Most annoying since it is not December but March. It also is quite repetitive in the choice of music. I still give it four stars."
"September 4, 2017","Love to listen to it while cleaning."
"October 22, 2016","For a while I loved Pandora after awhile I didn't use it as much today they sent me an email saying that the updated version had replay.I was so happy that I downloaded it.I went on and of course the replay button is not there"
"November 12, 2016","Enjoyment for hours. Music from all corners of the Music Industry."
"March 24, 2017","Well I can honestly say this is my favorite radio station and I've used it for many years. But when you have a problem with it, it's impossible to get it fixed. My son gave me a gift card and it isn't working. I've written so many times and on one will help me. The free version sucks (ads) so you really need to pay for it. I think if you buy it from Amazon it'll be better than buying it from Pandora directly. Amazon takes care of their customers but Pandora doesn't. Next time, I will go through Amazon so they will look after me!"
"October 20, 2017","Used to be great, now more commercials than music. Also has a disturbing tendency to just stop working. Lastly, when used on my Android it states that it requires the installation of Amazon Appstore (yet it doesn't need it to run?!)."
"August 20, 2017","Love the diversity of music Pandora offers"
"October 23, 2016","All the commercials suck, I pay for Pandora music not commercials."
"October 14, 2017","I love Pandora it's so cool !!!!"
"April 24, 2015","I've been using Pandora for about 2 years now and it's satisfied me as well as annoy the heck out of me. For example the ads can come up a lot or If I'm on the Slipknot radio and I hear a song from a band called Sevendust, I remember that I actually want to listen to more songs by Sevendust so I go ahead and play the Sevendust radio, but get this, Slipknot or some softcore rock starts playing! I'm not sure if it's just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on high(I have unlimited data, so it's not a problem for me). It's free so it's worth it but if you're thinking of getting Pandora One(Premium Membership) that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it's a lot better in my opinion."
"March 5, 2017","I listen everyday via, TV, telephone or something. Good variety and will play your choices if you rate the songs."
"March 14, 2013","Pandora is a really great app because you can type in your favorite artist or song and it will give you a station of that song, other songs by that artist, and similar songs. You can rate a song with a thumbs down, and it will never play again on that song! If you get Pandora you won't regret it, because you can follow other people with similar tastes and see what they are listening to. I have only one complaint, you can only skip 6 songs per hour/station. There are ads, but overall Pandora is really great."
"October 24, 2016","I don't see a replay button. The new app looks exactly the same."
"August 17, 2017","I have really enjoyed it."
"August 11, 2017","Fantastic Variety of Music!"
"July 24, 2017","Too many commercials. Other than that I enjoy it"
"November 22, 2013","Pandora offers you the ability to create your own radio stations based on your musical style choices and the artists whose music you enjoy the most, and it's commercial free (if you pay the modest $36.00 US or so per year). Although you cannot at this time request a specific song, you'll get commercial-free tunes in any genre you choose. I can't recommend Pandora highly enough. If you're tired of normal radio, try Pandora. You'll listen to deep cuts from most of the artists you select, as well as the top hit tracks from the albums you love. It's almost like having your record collection with you wherever you go! Try it....I'd be really surprised if you don't love it. You define your stations however you'd like. Then, shuffle them to present yourself with a variety of your favorites no matter what they might be."
"August 15, 2017","Pandora is an OK service, but the ability to ""create a station"" is quite overblown. When one creates a station with a (very) popular performer, that performer should be 50-70% (at least) of the songs played. I often find that percentage down around 10-20%. While I like being introduced to new artists that I might not have heard before, making them the most played is not what I am looking for.  I can go to YouTube and get all the songs I want from any artist I want.  That's the main reason I don't upgrade; it's not quite what I'm looking for. Comments welcome and info about upgrade features would be interesting."
"August 19, 2014","Pandora is the best. Years ago when I first got it for my phone, I had a tedious desk job where the only thing you did all day was do the same repetitive data entry task, and so we were allowed to wear headphones. I paid the $4 a month (at the time that was the price - I'm not sure if that's changed) to take away the ads, and man was it worth it. Best $4 a month I'd ever spent. Listening to music at this job was one of the only things there that kept me sane."
"January 23, 2014","I've been using Pandora for years and an always amazed by how will it chooses songs. I made a 6 hour car trip with a couple of my teenaged kids a while back and we listened to the same Pandora station for the whole drive and never had to skip a single song. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because you can't necessarily get the exact song you are looking for, you may have to wait a few songs for it to come up."
"January 16, 2013","It's easy to access, otherwise in this remote area Olympic Peninsula we have no radio service. I've been able to get all the types of music I enjoy listening to without interrupting ads or new broadcasts or sports!"
"November 18, 2016","The music on this app is incredibly great."
"April 17, 2016","The ads seem to load just fine, but the music plays for usually 1 second and it pauses, and hitting play doesn't work. This is the 3rd update in a row that has done this. This was nice when it worked."
"August 11, 2017","It's ok, too many ads"
"February 9, 2017","LUV, LUV, LUV Pandora! I really enjoy the variety of music I can listen to, depending on my mood. Thanks, Pandora!"
"July 23, 2014","Not a bad app, very easy to use and install. I find it allows me to jump from Classic Rock to Top 40 depending on my mood. This was recommended by my daughter, so I was skeptical. Guess what? It's working well with my kindle and Blue tooth headset."
"October 23, 2016","Very good to me"
"May 27, 2014","Listen to PANDORA all the time, i will say sometimes the songs are repetitive, but that's why it is important to click the thumbs up or down button as you're presented songs you like and don't like. It will start to figure out what you like and give you more thumbs up type of music :)"
"July 20, 2017","Great service, works well with my Tap and Dot, love to be able to say Alexis, play some soft Jazz or Daft punk, and, I'm off to great music land. Love it all!"
"October 12, 2015","I have left several reviews for this most bad. These were while I was using the free version. Ads cause it to buffer forever. Music was choppy. Timeouts happened often. After upgrading to Pandora one it's like a whole different app! Works flawlessly now, stations will download automatically to so even connection issues don't usually stop the music. It's so much faster now it's amazing. High quality audio works now. The selection and rating system is the best I have tried in any music app. Suggestions are usually very good. Sometimes despite constant thumbs down it keeps playing certain things but that's not too often. Browse feature in Pandora one is so good. This really is the app of your a music lover and if you really are a music lover you have to get the paid version, the difference is amazing!"
"June 22, 2017","Great app! You can set up individual radio stations for your favorite artist and Pandoras' software will follow the artist music types and play other artist that you probably never heard of. I have set up other stations from these Pandora suggestions and I am very happy with the results. The over the air radio stations are clueless on how to follow out the music types the public likes. I tracked over the air staions and they all have a 90 - 120 song rotation but Pandora is unlimited. Fantastic app."
"September 26, 2017","Unbelievable , way Pandora adds selections that similar to every other song and each one gets better and better. I did not know there were that many artist with such talent !!!"
"April 16, 2015","I have been using this app for year and prefer it over all the other music/radio apps. You can create your on stations to your own personal music genre and like or dislike select songs that play randomly. The song that you have given thumbs up to starts to store on that particular station so it can play as often as you like. It's almost like creating your own CD, but, you can add more stations and add select artist to that one particular station of your choice. In my opinion this app is easy to use and plays awesome music!!!"
"February 9, 2014","I haven't used Pandora for quite awhile so I didn't know what to expect. I was surprised to find it easy to use and it's free. Not many bargains like this today. You can pick one or more genres of music you like and listen to it all day. Create several stations of what you like and it will continuously load music. You can dislike a selection and it will immediately go to another song. You can chose either one of your stations or intermix your stations. Share your stations with others also. What's not to like."
"May 11, 2016","I simply cannot believe Pandora expects people to PAY for service! 1. The lyrics to songs are either wrong or non-existent. I've come across so many lyrics that have nothing to do with the current song playing! 2. If I were the artist, as to the Biography that was written about me, I would definitely contact someone at Pandora as they appear to be total idiots! How can anyone unintentionally, put in a biography about an artist, that isn't about that artist? O.o That fact is beyond "" Sloppy"" it's entirely Unprofessional!!!! 3. When creating a new station for the genre I enjoy, I am constantly given tracks that are not even in the same realm... ??? O.o So I sit and one after another, Thumbs down to the track.. How do they come up with this?  Mr.Westergren's statement as to Pandora competing with iTunes is ludicrous as it appears that Pandora is put together by a group of prepubescent children experimenting with a music program."
"July 25, 2017","Always love Pandora"
"November 15, 2016","Thank You"
"January 19, 2017","Wonderful music of your choosing and excellent app. And for full members you can now rewind songs if you'd like."
"November 15, 2016","An excellent selection of music from all genres interrupted only occasionally by a single short commercial message."
"February 23, 2014","Easy to use, and a TON of musical genres are available. If you have the Fire HD with Dolby speakers (as I do), it offers a great listening experience. It's just like a radio station (commercials), but with music you select yourself. It's especially great if you happen to live in a rural farming town that only gets bad country music stations and Jesus radio. Yep, I'm stuck in the sticks and Pandora has probably saved my sanity. Well, whatever little I have left anyway. hahahaha"
"March 25, 2014","I have subscribed to Pandora since they first offered package without ads - 2006 I believe - and listened for years before that. I have enthusiastically recommended the service to dozens and dozens of friends and even mere acquaintances; I figured I was doing them a good turn. NO MORE. Today's trigger was a Bait & Switch with the re-registration. The fee was listed a $3.99/month or $36/year, but only the one option in Google Play, a single button purchase at the monthly rate = $48 year. That's .33 more expensive than the listed annual rate. This is trickery and I take such details very seriously. It conveys to me that Pandora is now 1. a system that treats me disrespectfully and 2. it is run by those many now in business, who are consumed by avarice and greed. I know that businesses exist to make money and any service to consumers is only an epiphenomena, but this wasn't always the case with Pandora. It feels like a lose and makes me sad. But I could have live with this change. I did find great new music. There it is a far more sinister aspect Brave-New-Pandora: it is data mining all aspects of users' choice of music. ............. [...] Mr. Bieschke (Pandora's chief scientist) says ""We take all of these signals and look at correlations that lead us to come up with magical insights about somebody."" People's music, movie or book choices may reveal much more than commercial likes and dislikes. Certain product or cultural preferences can give glimpses into consumers' political beliefs, religious faith, sexual orientation or other intimate issues. That means many organizations now are not merely collecting details about where we go and what we buy, but are also making inferences about who we are. ... Out of $427.1 million in revenue in the 2013 fiscal year, advertising generated $375.2 million. ............. Just what, in fact is Pandora's business? It just creeps me out that my music is being used to profile me. I've uninstalled the app."
"September 7, 2013","If you love music and discovering new music, Pandora is the single best reason for broadband access.  I listen to music every day. My musical tastes are diverse and I love to discover new artists. Until now, I've listened via my computer at home and work. I spend a fair amount of time on the road and I just purchased a smartphone primarily so I can listen to Pandora on the go.  I realize other people value different experiences and functions but, for me, this new phone and app added a large measure of joy to my mobile days.  As far as the app itself, I just started using it so I've got an impression, not an opinion. I need more time and data for that. However, it works similarly to the desktop app and browser versions. I haven't run across a big hurdle yet."
"January 6, 2017","Works great on the Kindle Fire. I love being able to choose music I enjoy and hearing music from my favorite genres."
"January 18, 2013","another app that will not work on my kindle. i am still wondering why some things work ans some will not"
"April 4, 2015","Ok people. Hello I am Abigail. I LOVE💖MUSIC. Ok? This should cost 5:99! Think of it this way, you get to listen to music for free and create your own stations!😁🎼🎹 But don't take my word for it, get it! PLZ??? I hoped you liked my review. P.S Dena filardi is not me it is my mom."
"August 2, 2017","I like Pandora when there is something specific I want to listen to and know I'll hear the songs I like."
"December 30, 2012","I love that you can choose what type of music or the artist you want to hear. It will play for a long time and just in case there are no interruptions, the app will ask if you are still listening. At which point, you can choose to keep listening or stop until the next time. Furthermore, the sound is excellent. I never have any glitches, or issues that prevent me from listening. The ads in between several songs catch you off guard, but its like radio, without the characters. The ads come and go and you're back to listening to your music preference. I recommend this app to all music lovers for anytime use!"
"January 8, 2013","When I first discovered Pandora, I absolutely loved it. However, over time, the ""stations"" became the same songs in the same rotation. I am somebody who listens to music 10+ hours a day. It got so that I could hear the next song coming before it played. While they started off well and had a great selection...I have migrated to Spotify. You can customize your playlist, and I have found some wonderfully obscure artists there. Pandora might become to streaming music what the VHS was to home video. It was good for its time, but easily replaced."
"July 1, 2017","pretty good"
"June 24, 2017","Love cuts out"
"January 31, 2014","We love this!!! Select any music, set up multiple channels for your own person desires, set multiple channels for every style and 'LIKE' the songs being played and you get more of the same style or 'DISLIKE; and you get less of the artists or style you dislike. Its one of the easiest things we've ever had and so much nicer than radio. No commercials, non-stop music, and just what you want to hear. You can't get better than that! I even link my phone to my blue tooth in the car and listen to Pandora in the car as I drive across country...MUCH better than satellite radio, every day of the week."
"June 12, 2017","Old school,new,jazz broad variety of music."
"July 18, 2017","I have about 20 stations that I shuffle and it still plays a lot of the same songs over and over. More variety, per station would make it a 5 star app."
"June 23, 2017","I am enjoying listening to the music I like through Pandora. I listen to my music in the car and all other places that I may be."
"June 14, 2017","I like it"
"July 18, 2017","I love how easy it is to log in from all types of devices, whether my iPhone or school computer. The set lists I create have led me to hear all kinds of music that I'd otherwise not hear. The commercials pass along quickly so I don't mind them. Free music is good!"
"May 15, 2017","love their music etc"
"February 22, 2013","I have stack and stacks of unused cds since discovering Pandora. I've made classical and Latin and alternative and celtic stations, just to name a few, and with a few ""like"" and ""dislike"" clicks on various pieces of music, my stations play a wonderful blend of all the things I like best. I love the way one can add variety to any given station by suggesting different artists, composers or compositions. Pandora has taken the hours and hours of work out of making the perfect personal blends of music for any occasion. Highly recommend."
"June 21, 2015","so ive been trying to install Pandora on my Kindle but it wont let me. I have the app on my other device and love it so I wanted to put it on my kindle, but insteadbpf installing the app it says ""error"" and ""please try again later"". if anyone knows how to download it on a kindle. or of any app similar to Pandora id.appreciate it. thank you. :)"
"February 18, 2016","This is the best app it has happy music soothing music and any kind of music you want"
"June 16, 2017","Great to listen to the music you like to hear."
"June 2, 2017","LOVE THIS APP"
"July 16, 2016","ABSOLUTELY AMAZE!!! I love it so much! YAY FINALLY AN APP THAT I CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC WHILE PLAYING A GAME WITH NO SOUND! I love how you can go to a game and just play it while the song is going! Only problem is the skip limit. Sometime when Work is playing I'm just like ""SKIP!"" And then u ppl won't let me :(. So I have to go to another station. But that's just minor! ITS A AMAZING!!!"
"April 27, 2017","great music app"
"April 4, 2016","Heard about Pandora, sounded good so I downloaded it, went to sign up and log in and it says &#34;thanks for your interest but we can' t accept your request&#34; . no explanation, no try later, just no"
"May 4, 2017","I love picking my music , not many commercials"
"June 15, 2017","music!"
"July 29, 2016","I had to uninstall because it kept saying my session timed out when I wasn't even listening. I even restarted device before uninstalled. When I reinstalled, it just kept saying wrong email...even though I hadn't put one in. Won't allow me to do anything and just had a loading screen."
"May 25, 2017","Great Product"
"June 13, 2017","awesome"
"April 12, 2015","Love me some PANDORA!!! I've learned all kinds of things about music history (which I love.) It's the only music source I have, so it really means a lot to me to have it at my fingertips, and take with me wherever."
"June 17, 2017","Love it"
"June 4, 2017","great app"
"December 12, 2014","It sucks that you can't actually play a song that you want when you want. It sucks that even if you pay you still have a limited number of skips. BUT, it does have some of the best variety of music of the streaming apps. I use it when I just need background music going. Google Play Music All-Access is a much better alternative, but you have to fork over $9.99/month for that so its not for everybody."
"November 4, 2016","C"
"June 19, 2017","Ok"
"September 27, 2015","Pandora is far beyond awsome. Millions of songs and genres to choose from. May not offer unlimited skips but there's ways around it. Also price wise for yearly plans. Spotify is $119.98 a year and $9.99 a month. Pandora is $4.99 a month. Yearly is $60. Huge difference on price."
"January 18, 2013","Its pandora. If you haven't heard of pandora then I can't help you. it is to so do if as"
"January 17, 2013","I always listen to music thru Pandora and will continue to do so. I would not mind a feature that would let me repeat a song I would like to hear over again."
"April 14, 2014","I am one of the first subscribers of Sirius satellite radio (within the first year of it starting). Pandora is probably going to be my new paid service. I can play and listen to pretty much everything I want too. Sirius has kind of become just like the free radio stations. If and when Howard Stern leaves I will probably get rid of my subscription but even then Howard seems like he is just phoning in his show so I am really thinking about cancelling my subscription with Sirius and going with Pandora."
"June 19, 2017","Selection of music is good. But way, way, way too many ads on the free service. I'd rather just choose an FM radio station that plays music I like. Very disappointing."
"September 7, 2017","This app is not what it claims to be. I put in what I liked and it gave me songs I hated. Have tried several times and it is a waste of money."
"August 12, 2016","I enjoy making and listen my own listed stations. The music of 70""s and 80""s is what I grow up on and just love the ballard and the message in the songs."
"May 12, 2017","as expected"
"April 17, 2017","A good value for free"
"October 7, 2017","I usually listen to heart radio and switched to Pandora and like the music option s they give that are more diversified . I'm happy with that choice.👩💁"
"September 25, 2016","This is by far the worst music app I have ever used.I keep trying it to see if it gets any better, but no it only gatsby worse every time I try it. I tried it on my computer years ago and it did okay but eventually it just got to where it did not work.This time it worked and then skipped half of each song. Will not be trying Pandora ever again."
"January 15, 2013","pandora is an amazing service, as both a free app and a paid service. i downloaded the app and switched to premium shortly after( less tjat 5 bucks a month! ) i use it every day and almost never use my skips. the stations are very well tailored and chances are you wont be skipping many songs."
"July 7, 2012","I thought it would be nice to listen to the radio when I was waiting for someone when I had a WIFI available. I didn't realize that I had to sell my soul to do so! This app bombarded me with ads and forces you to sign in with your email address just to use it. They want to get you to buy the paid version, and it has limited options to listen to your preferred artist. It also clips the ends of many songs which I hate.  The permissions list for this app is just crazy. Why should a radio app gain access to my personal data, modify my calendar and send email to guests and read my contact data. That is exceptionally invasive and I don't want to share that data with someone's server.  Here is a list of the permissions on my Amazon Kindle. * Network communication - full internet access and create Bluetooth connections * Your personal information - add or modify calendar events and send email to guests, read contact data * Storage - modify delete internal storage contents * Kindle calls - read Kindle state and identity * System tools - Bluetooth administration, change WIFI state prevent kindle from sleeping * Network communication - view network state, view WIFI state * System tools - automatically set start at boot  I just found the app to not work very well, not have the controls I wanted and its invasion of my data was over the top of what I thought was necessary to listen to the radio. I have deleted it from my Kindle Fire."
"August 8, 2014","I have Pandora on my Kindle, Phone and PC. I've set up a number of favorites playlist to chose from. I like a wide variety of music and Pandora has it all. I upgraded to a premium subscription; very good price and worth the upgrade. I plug my Kindle into my stereo in my shop and play music all day long. The sound is very good, and if you have a decent internet connection the gaps are very minimal."

"January 4, 2015","Pandora does a great job in selecting the music for the type of radio station you select. I have been enjoying Pandora on my computer for many years and recently downloaded it to my new smart phone. You have the opportunity to listen to a new set of up and coming artists. Would not go anywhere with out it. A wonderful and easy way to enjoy your favorite type of music weather on your computer or on the go."
"August 28, 2017","Four stars because it's easy to use, really love it. The Con is the commercials and repeat offers to buy a subscription."

"August 14, 2017","My favorite music app. Just add the name of the artist or the song and it will automatically play the songs that are in the same league or genres"
"December 4, 2014","I use this when I'm working out to give me motivation. The advertising can be a bit annoying, but the ability to customize your stations and seek out your favorite music is wonderful. You can also just let them surprise you. I also love that you can connect with other to check out their music."
"January 12, 2017","I am loving Pandora. I like some of the stations they have created but I also like the stations that I am creating. Absolutely NO COMPLAINTS and I would recommend to everyone who likes music."

"March 14, 2013","I love the variety of the music. I have 12 different personal categories and get a beautiful mix when I shuffle them. It makes me think I don't need to buy cds anymore! When I want to hear one kind of music I choose that category, but I usually enjoy the mix. You can even customize the categories you choose so it's more suited to your own personal tastes. I have added and subtracted specific artists or songs from the categories, so it's really what I enjoy!"

"March 27, 2017","great app for music."
"May 2, 2017","I use it everyday."
"May 13, 2017","I Love it"
"May 25, 2016","GET THIS FREAKING APP! IT LETS U LISTEN TO UR FAVE MISIC AND U GET TO MAKE UR OWN STATIONS"
"September 2, 2017","So much music to choose from. Fantastic. Easy to use, once you get going"
"July 31, 2017","What a treasure , All my favorite music purched on 78 rpm, on 45 rpm. 8 track etc. It is all here and I love it."
"January 24, 2017","There's not much to say. The app does what it's supposed to do. I do wish there was a larger buffering system, but I was able to make a 500mi road trip with minimal interruptions."
"August 28, 2013","This app is great. When I first heard about it, I downloaded it onto my Fire right away. But, it seems to lag my Kindle a lot when I use it, so I give it a 4 star rating."
"May 7, 2015","However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $36 yearly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""  That's why I use Milk Music. You pay less only $4.00 per month and you'll get unlimited Skips with no Ads.  I think I'm going to say with Milk Music."
"April 2, 2017","Nice and good"
"April 15, 2017","love it"
"April 6, 2017","listen all the time"
"June 19, 2016","I love the option of free choice. I can either listen to their choices or make a playlist of what I like. I have diverse tastes and am glad to be able to have my favorites availabe for me."
"May 3, 2017","Love it"
"April 4, 2017","I use this app all the time. I love having my own custom playlist!"
"September 10, 2016","if you love music you gotta get pandora it have alot of great station and teaches itself to learn the music you like and want to hear"
"April 20, 2016","Got me an Ultimate Spinach station. Booya! Would like to see the Native American stations listed in the genre listings, instead of having to type them in. You know, under ""World""."
"April 15, 2017","great"
"January 30, 2014","You will spend a lot of ""data"" using Pandora if you are away from home/wireless. Always good to buy songs from Amazon and download to your phone as I do. Find those songs on Pandora/Wifi while free, and you can buy them very cheap on Amazon... here. A new song a month;.50 cents? something to look forward too. Save your songs on your phone; Then put on the head phones at home or at the doctors office or walking, and read the Bible or the LA Times or new books like author ""Chris Perez, ""To Selena with Love"" ! Its free after download; no use of data! You saved it on your phone! It's yours!"
"June 1, 2016","I hav had Pandora for several years it is the first time I hav it on my phone...I hav always loved it...it came in handy when I didn't hav Wi-Fi but had phone service...😊"
"April 4, 2017","Like it"
"March 14, 2014","I like a very wide range of music including country, Motown, jazz, Native American flute, show tunes, hip hop, and classical. I can only get that variety on Pandora. I have been tapping the thumbs up or thumbs down button to the songs pandora chooses for me ever since I downloaded it to my shiny new iPad 1 - was that 6 years ago? The result is I have the perfect radio station for my eclectic taste of music. No where else can I hear the smooth jazz fusion of Hiroshima followed by a sound track from the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. Pandora goes with me on all my devices and was a factor in me purchasing my Honda CRV - it came with Pandora built in! The commercials are annoying to me because the original Pandora was commercial free. Now they break in after every 6 or 7 songs. Still less frequent than regular radio but I might have to break down and pay the $4 a month to get rid of them. Best music app hands down."
"January 21, 2013","it has all ur favorite songs that u love trust me I listen to Pandora every day and if u listen to music all the time then this is for u and it is free"
"June 26, 2017","Great music,informative ads and loads of information on all of your favorite artists. And, it's all set up the way I want it, not some faceless disc jockey. It's great."
"July 30, 2013","Easy to use. Haven't set up my account yet but will enjoy the music as I read or do emails on my kindle fire."
"March 27, 2017","Love it"
"June 15, 2017","good"
"June 6, 2017","A good selection of music at no or low cost. I would recommend it to anyone."
"June 22, 2017","My husband loves loves loves Pandora. He would listen to it 24 hours a day if he could. He loves the fact he can listen to his favorite artists only. He can't say eniugh good about Pandora!!"
"June 4, 2016","Pandora for my tablet is just what I wanted. New things I haven't heard mixed with old things I love from the same genres, plus lyrics, and adaptive playlists. Love it!"
"April 1, 2017","thank you"
"September 2, 2017","The ads are way louder than the music. The music times out too soon. I like to set it for long periods. The stations' music selections are too commercial and repetitive. I listen to classical, so why do I have to keep hearing Vivaldi's "" the seasons"" every day? How about some in depth recordings of certain composers on different days?"
"August 22, 2014","I am a ""senior citizen"" and new to the idea of sampling music online. My tastes range from Portuguese fado and neo tango music to Brian Eno & Harry Partch. In one week of happily skipping about Pandora, I have only found ONE composer they could not locate.  I'm not wild about the occasional car ads, but that is a small price to pay for the pleasure and education Pandora has afforded me. Three cheers for this new-fangled technology, which is also intuitive and easy to use!"
"January 23, 2014","I love this app. There is only one thing that is really makes me mad is that sometimes it plays artists I didn't download. But just get it it's really good but just that one thing I'm not trying to make you not buy it."
"December 29, 2014","""I love my Pandora!"" Radio will never be the same for me. I actually have thought of getting the Ad-Free Pandora One, but am not ready to pay $4.99 a month yet. I'm such a cheapskate. I probably will once I get more gadgets that will allow me to use Pandora. Once that happens it's totally worth it because your linked to your own account no matter what gadget your using at the time. Go Pandora !"
"February 13, 2017","Perfect for my tablet..."
"May 19, 2016","It's free, with only three or four ads per hour. You pick an artist and it sets up a channel playing music by them or in a similar genre. What's to complain about?"
"March 7, 2013","I love this app. You can move around on the carousel and even read books while listening to your favorite music. The only thing I don't like so far, is that I have been notified that they will charge for any amount of listening over 40 hours/mo. I don't think that is right, because I already have an account with Pandora through our Netflix account. So it should be covered already. I know it imported all my ""stations"" from that account. If you have an account with Netflix, be aware of this. It might be a new policy. I don't know."
"April 19, 2017","GREAT"
"July 31, 2017","I really enjoy the fact that I can choose my own music. And no commercials is really nice!"
"November 7, 2016","I have been listeneing to Pandora for years and just love it"
"July 14, 2017","Listening to Pandora has exposed me to music I love that I wouldn't have found any other way."
"September 6, 2017","Great app to listen to music that you are more likely to enjoy based on your preferences"
"August 30, 2017","Love listening to Pandora. Nice to choose my venue and use thumbs down to remove what I don't want to listen to."
"September 30, 2017","How very wonderful to be able to listen to whatever kind of music you're in the mood for,whenever you want it. Love it !"
"May 3, 2017","Don't ever sign up. They make it almost impossible for you to get out. Also you have to go back and tell them you are listening. Furthermore, if you like one artist go to Amazon FIRE, PRIME and just ask Alexa for the artist you want and that is what you get. I doubt that Pandora will be around for long."
"March 20, 2016","WOW I LOVE IT! Free music! No limits! The only thing that's bad are the ads but those only come in after like SEVEN songs and there is only one or two. You must get it if you love music. Even my daughter loves it she can listen to disney songs ALL day. It's perfect for when your trying to clean to."
"August 12, 2017","I think it is grate I am 80 and it is great to listen to what I did in the 50's,it is really grate"
"May 23, 2016","It plays awesome"
"May 3, 2016","I downloaded this for my wife's cell phone which is an android. When I did mine (I have an Iphone) I did not get prompted to amazon. Anyway, it was free. I really like pandora, getting rid of sirius which does'nt have as good as channels."
"March 26, 2017","Love it"
"December 25, 2015","Great mobile app to access your Pandora music. Easy to use, has a sleep timer and it would be rare to have any issues. Easy to use and recommend if you use Pandora."
"May 11, 2016","Had this for a couple of years and it is far and away the best streaming music commercial free program I have tried and the only one I bought other than Amazon Primes which is far clumsier and diffcult to program and less flexible so far"
"September 26, 2016","Never tried it before... but I actually love it. It's amazing!"
"April 28, 2017","works great"
"June 25, 2017","It's a chance to pick and choose music listening that suites my tastes and memories. Great!"
"March 18, 2015","Ive had Pandora One for over a year, and it was great. I enjoyed it. I wasn't a fan that you were still limited with how many songs you could skip but I can deal. For the past three months Ive had ongoing issues with one of my stations that should be playing Today's Hits... normally it plays the newest hits that you find on the current radio and new music. Lately its been playing weird folk music. I've sent numerous emails and have gotten responses ranging from ""we're sorry"" to ""its working as expected"", well its not working as expected. I shouldn't have to thumbs down the same songs more than once on the same station... twice in a row, I shouldn't have to thumbs down it more than once ever on the same station. they seem to hope Ill just give up. My thought is if I'm paying 5 a month for something I expect you to make an effort to fix the issue. Its only one station with the issue, and I cant even delete the station and set it up again... it simply opens the old one back up.  Come on Pandora, you can do better. Your service has gone downhill."
"November 20, 2016","The music is so relaxing when I'm working around the house."
"December 9, 2016","Free radio that I get to customize?!? My only complaint is when I say I will turn it off after the next bad song, but every song is good because I chose them all!!!!"
"January 3, 2017","Great!! Works Well!!"
"May 17, 2017","Good"
"August 11, 2017","Love the music..it great to hear a song that you have not heard for a long time."
"February 2, 2016","I like the shuffle of the music I have chosen, but not the ads for prioposim or whatever Cialis is hawking or is that because they want you to become annoyed enough to spend money for no ad listening?"
"April 13, 2017","Great music. I enjoy different genres and all are played with sensitivity to my enjoyment."
"May 31, 2016","I LOVE Pandora Radio & have been subscribing on my office PC for years. I was glad to be able to download the program to my Kindle over the weekend since I was not able to get on the web with my netbook.  Thank you!"
"August 25, 2017","I love Pandora Plus. I when choose a certain artist or choir I would prefer to hear all of their songs before hearing similar songs. B G"
"May 9, 2017","When playing music long time sound goes up and down have to adjust volume it varies what songs are playing"
"September 19, 2016","Love Pandora ,,, allows you to choose different genre's of music and you are also able to make your own playlists...which is just up my alley!!! A great selection of music .. LOve it!!!!"
"September 3, 2017","Just love Pandora. Great music for every era."
"August 6, 2017","Great music anytime."
"March 3, 2016","YOU SHOULD GET IT IT GIVES YOU ALL THE RADIO STATIONS FOR YOUR FAMOUS SINGER'S"
"December 10, 2016","who doesn't love Pandora?"
"August 27, 2013","Man, I am so glad that I was able to get this music station, I had heard about it and did not know where I could get it. It is a wonderful station, playing music by your selective artist and than following up with artist of the same quality. Thank you."
"August 9, 2017","Just love it keeps my group of 3 percenters hyped up during our anti Antifa training at planet fittness lol."
"October 24, 2017","Pandora is the best money can buy for no advertising music radio stations."
"October 29, 2017","I already have it on my iPad works ok except I can't pair it with my stereo have to use my ipad"
"November 3, 2016","Great music"
"May 17, 2016","I have been listening to Pandora for a couple of years. i really enjoy it. I can pick the music I listened to growing up and then add in something different once in a while. It is great for cleaning cleaning and relaxing."
"October 9, 2016","Love this app! Works great on my new FireHD8!"
"March 24, 2017","Sound on app keeps going loud on some songs and so low on others that it's starting to annoy the crap out of me."
"November 24, 2012","I liked it but I would put on the Taylor swift radio it gives me I'm sexy and I know it besides that I love listening to it while I play a app if it would let me put four and a half stars I would! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING. if you disagree how about you make your own review and don't judge mine by its cover ""I liked it but..."" Thanks Again!"
"August 28, 2014","This chanel is well worth listening to. Very little commercials and nothing but music. You get the option to create radio stations based on the band genre you pick. Just recently, I was listening to a station that I created, and heard new bands from the same genre. This increase my music repertoire. I highly recommend this application."
"August 6, 2017","Nice to have MY choice of music any time and any where! Thanks Pandora!"
"January 14, 2016","Pandora Radio is very good and high quality streaming music. the sound is crisp and clear and yes there are commercials but not as many as there are on other streaming music sites so you get more hours of uninterrupted music than anywhere else. highly reccomend"
"July 29, 2013","Good selection of music....just tooooooo many commercials. I understand the concept, but they pop up at the most inconvenient times. Other than that, I like the app"
"February 6, 2017","I love it. I can put on a station on the 50's music and it plays songs that I love and have forgotten about! So glad I downloaded it's!"
"April 29, 2015","Free music, streaming while I do chores, make phone calls, handle the kids, or whatever else the day might hold! I can pick the kind of music I want to play, tweek it by adding more artist / songs I like, & then choosing thumbs up and down for each song. Furthermore, I don't like the song I can skip it. LOVE LOVE LOVE! My children love it too!"
"September 6, 2017","Love it. It has variations which it let hear music from different decades in the same station,"
"November 21, 2013","I think this is absolutely the BEST music app I've ever had! It's better than I Heart Radio by a landslide! Any station you can think of, Pandora has it!! It isn't like a real broadcast radio station, but if you type in something like Today's Adults Hits, all that station plays is today's hits! If you don't have the paid version (4 dollars a month) however, it has some ads. Oh, and another thing. You will get a lot of E-mails telling you what songs you like (they would know because there is an option of 4 buttons, one is Like, one is Dislike-automatically skips song- skip, and pause) and what new songs are for the season. I like the e-mails, however, even if you hate e-mails. Well, I don't have the paid version, and I think it's amazing! Seriously, get the app! No station limit, no anything but songs of your choice and a couple ads."
"February 4, 2016","Love this, I did get to try at a discount for my honest review but will keep at the regular price! What a selection and I love all the choices, I listen all the time & am looking into speakers, I can play at night & not disturb the neighbors upstairs!"
"August 31, 2017","I love Pandora and have listened to it for years. Great song selection."
"May 20, 2016","If you're not fussy about getting the exact song you want, Pandora's good. Thumbs up the songs you like. Thumbs down the songs you don't and they won't play them again. The more you vote, the better your station gets."
"October 27, 2016","Great Radio even with ads. They're not long. You pick your favorite artists. What's better?!"
"July 22, 2017","We love this app! I play the dinner time station at meals time to set a nice cheerful mood and the lullaby stations to help settle my kid down for bed."
"August 8, 2015","I loved my Pandora channels UNTIL THE LAST UPDATE! Now, nothing works. I deleated the app and reinstalled, signed in and the thing is still FUBAR! Dammit! Do I wait and see if they bother to fix the problem, or, choose a different app and try to recreate my old but perfect listening stream? Ugh, not happy!"
"April 5, 2016","I Love listening to my favorite types of music and favorite musicians. Pandora gives you the choice, to listen to the musicians you choose and what type of music you wish. There are music stations on Pandora for everyone's taste."
"January 18, 2013","Great FREE App ! I have down loaded this to both our Kindles and we love it and use it often !!!"
"August 23, 2017","Love this app. It lets you customize your listeneing enjoyment."
"March 29, 2016","I have selected several different types of music and am really enjoying the station. When you don't like what is airing on some of the local stations, it is so relaxing to choose a favorite and tune in. It is an excellent choice."
"November 15, 2016","very happy with it , works well"
"February 29, 2016","App for my tablet"
"September 30, 2017","I had Pandora several years ago on my IPhone but since I no longer have one and I have an android now with not much memory, I loaded it to my Kindle. I must say that I love the new format and am enjoying it a lot!!"
"February 6, 2017","love it"
"July 29, 2016","Love to listen to this app. Has all kinds of kids channels too"
"December 31, 2015","Just like most subscription services the music tends to repeat itself even with all the selections that they could match to my likes. It's a nice thing to have when I want to hear artists I am not familiar with but I prefer Google Play Music and Sirius XM."
"August 2, 2017","We like to use Pandora at the office for the background sound."
"January 30, 2015","Great app, I love being exposed to new music based on artists I already enjoy. With your phone and a bluetooth speaker, you have a stereo anywhere and can create your own radio stations. I was never able to use it when traveling in other countries, which is frustrating, but I do understand about licensing rights, so I realize it's an unavoidable nuisance."
"July 31, 2017","I enjoy listening to the music, nothing really to say, its a good app."
"May 3, 2016","I like this app because of music variety plus I can customize according to my moods. I also like to use the timer, more control n convenient. Great app!"
"March 25, 2017","very good"
"October 18, 2016","Pandora gets it when it comes to music!"
"December 20, 2016","I love Pandora and love the variety. I only wish I could make my own stations with certain music like a playlist and the alarm doesn't work well"
"August 30, 2017","Wonderful library of classical and jazz"
"November 8, 2017","Pandora is my go-to app for my radio needs. I love that I can pick playlists based on my favorite artists, and then discover new artists through that playlists. The app truly is tailored to my needs."
"May 4, 2017","This is the most wonderful music channel ever. I listen at home on an internet radio, on the computer and especially in the car with a smart phone hookup. I have established an extensive playlist of the most beautiful music (at least to me) I could ever imagine. There is a cost outside of a Wi-Fi connection but to me it is worth every penny."
"September 1, 2017","I like how it can pick the music that I love to listen to."
"August 28, 2017","All the artists you choose plus great recommendations of similar artists."
"June 6, 2015","Best one yet. I was currently a Spotify premium member for 9.99 a month. Let me tell u it sucked sure music u want on demand, but radio would keep playing tracks over and over and over again as if the DJ in my phone was drunk. Now I've switched back to Pandora. I would pay for Pandora too if it had unlimited skips."
"October 30, 2016","Nice to have a large variety of music."
"March 1, 2016","By clicking on one or two artists I have all my favorite music. I can set the app to play while I go to sleep and to wake me up again the next morning. I am watching much less TV now that I have my favorite music at my fingertips!"
"May 16, 2015","50+ yr old un-hip white guy here who generally shys away from new technology, but I'm hooked on Pandora. I love just about any kind of music and love that Pandora predicts what I will like based on what I already told it I like. I'm now a Pandora junkie!"
"April 3, 2012","love Pandora! free music without static or numerous commercials and the ones you do have you can skip fairly quickly"
"October 23, 2016","Love it, listen to anything you want."
"June 30, 2016","I noticed Pandora used to stream 192 kbps for free with advertisement. Now it looks like you have to pay to get that quality. That stinks. When I pay I would hope they at least stream at 320 kbps. Really, they should stream lossless as an option in the settings. It's like paying for satellite radio. Why would I when the quality is set so low? Everyone has just gotten away from really listening to albums because there way too much loss at these qualities. Pandora, please upgrade to a higher streaming kbps. Otherwise, I'll never pay for it. You are now asking us to pay for 192, when you used to offer it free. What's the incentive then? None."
"September 1, 2015","If you don't know what Pandora is or how it performs, I'm curious as to why you'd be attempting to download an app on a horse & buggy. That being said, the mobile app works great and functions almost exactly like the mobile and desktop sites. A must-have on all of my mobile devices."
"April 20, 2016","Let me just say I have been enjoying Pandora for the past few days, I'm so glad I got it, I of course heard of Pandora, and friends and family have it, been telling me to get it I finaly did, my point is just get it and enjoy."
"August 28, 2016","Pandora as u promise the world u are connected in world so don't forget to help the a person in need"
"October 3, 2017","About Pandora; The music is fine but I can't seem to be able to sign up. Changing a password is impossible."
"October 30, 2016","Neat ,listen to it all the time."
"February 11, 2016","Love it. I buy it to avoid the ads. I'm very satisfied with Echo. The only problem I have is how echo doesn't hear me when music is playing. It has to be turned down low and then it can hear me. But that's a minor problem that I can live with."
"December 12, 2013","Love it. It works even better than the one on my PC. The tablet app is so easy to use and makes listening to my favorite songs very enjoyable. I have 5 ""radio"" stations setup and switching between them give me the songs for those different moments. I don't even need the DELUXE version since the short 30 second adds are far less than any radio. I think they ""interrupt"" less because I rate each of the songs as I listen and relax. WELL WORK LOADING."
"January 28, 2015","I really like this app. I have a Pandora account and now that I have my Kindle Fire, I tend to listen to Pandora much more than I used to. I especially like to listen to my selected music tastes while working on a project or just reading on my Kindle. I find it very relaxing. This is one free app that I get a lot of use out of and I just love it."
"February 16, 2016","I have iHeart on my phone, but I prefer Pandora. I love being able to make new stations based on artist, genre, or even song. We listen to Pandora on our Roku most every day. Now if we could all just agree on what station to put on!"
"November 28, 2012","at first it would not shut off, had to shut down my kindle and restart to have pandora off. that was fixed(majic) but now it will go thru a whole song without making any sound come out of my kindle, unles you pause and un pause, sometimes more than once. i have been using pandira on my blackberry for years without any of these problems. was gonna buy pandora one, but not with the way its acting. i uninstalled and reinstalled, this is your last chance pandora......"
"October 28, 2016","The best, Even with commertials!"
"July 30, 2017","Pandora works great on our devices. No issues at all."
"July 18, 2017","Gives me the music I want when and where I want it, that simple!"
"July 19, 2017","Thus far I like this. I have been listening to some classical music"
"September 12, 2015","Best ui,best songs,best app period. Other than a few commercials on the lite version. This app will never let you down. On every device I own with the original account. Just wish that they had an option to play mp4 as well as mp3. Like Pandoras BOX. Haha. How's about it dev?"
"March 24, 2015","Pandora is nice, had it a while back then switched to Spotify for a while and now switched back, Pandora suites me just as well, and its FREE!"
"August 31, 2017","Love being able to hear my favorite artists and then get new ones of the same genre. Multiple stations for multiple moods. They even have a special station for your pets☺"
"February 10, 2017","Don't know if its going to be good but my grandma had it for awhile and is able to download any music she wants so this might be better then any other music app I had. I just don't want to pay for anything lmao"
"May 23, 2016","plays just what I'm wanting to hear, but don't know all the artist...;-) to make the just right station"
"May 10, 2015","This i believe is my favorite app ever! The music selections are great and sound quality is awesome! I have selected about 25 of my favorite artists and with each artist you get other artists that compliment each other. And the shuffle option means i can listen all day and only hear my favorite performers!"
"June 22, 2012","This is by far one of the best mobile app's out there.  I've been using Pandora daily and what's great about the mobile app (as opposed to the desktop version) is that there's no break in the playlist. Sure, you have advertisements that pop up every few minutes but that's a small price to pay. Everything else is great, great selection and ever-increasing song list and the ability to switch channels when I want to hear something else. I don't particularly like ""mixing"" radio stations but that my preference and I can control that.  Pandora radio for mobile. 5 stars."
"July 31, 2017","Hubby loves his music and Pandora is the best."
"January 31, 2017","Love Pandora. I can listen to anything I want to and mix it up. Some days I listen to piano and classical. Other days I listen to pop or retro plus many more stations."
"November 11, 2015","Absolutely LOVE Pandora!! One of my absolute favorite ways to listen to music. You pick your song and it just seems to know what you want to listen to. It's super user friendly and spot on with my selections. Very pleased with this app. I have a Galaxy S6."
"December 8, 2015","Really like the categories and source selection opportunities. The only thing I don't care too much for is you are limited to skipping ahead or 'thumbs down'. Once I figured it out, I just used another category to fine tune my selections. Great for traveling!"
"September 19, 2017","Works great . Plays lots of music songs you know ."
"November 21, 2014","I did not download Pandora onto my Kindle when I was asked to give personal information. My nephew explained to me that Pandora wanted that information so they could have commercials that are interesting to a person with my profile. Since I am not a big fan of commercials and I can listen to Amazon Prime Music commercial free, why would I download it."
"April 25, 2015","Pandora has helped me learn about and share new music for years, now. I love their service. I use it all the time. Their radio feature throws less curveballs than the other services I've tried. One of the other services kept trying to get me to listen to Kanye on my Taylor Swift station. I'm not even kidding."
"January 6, 2015","For main words: Three Dog Night Radio!!!  Oh my goodness, I am loving this app! I can't get enough of it. The ads don't really bug me. They're reasonable in length and I find them more tolerable than the raunchy television commercials."
"September 12, 2013","I prefer spotify and google all access or even mog. But since my subscriptions ran out and mog and all access is not on the app. I am using pandora for the first time. All though I don't want to use it because I don't have a subscription, so I just listen to 42 kbps or whatever the quality is for the song. The songs it plays are accurate, they are the songs I want to listen to. I love this app"
"July 5, 2015","We use Pandora all the time and have for years. Fantastic music service, creates play lists based on a favorite song, artist, genre. You can improve listening experience by personalizing tastes with ""likes"" and ""don't likes."" Would give 5 stars back before there were ads! :-)"
"August 4, 2017","Great app, one of the best sites around."
"November 13, 2014","Pandora is perfect listening tuned to what I like in music. There is music for every genre that I can customize for whatever mood I'm into for the moment. It's nice to be able to listen to music when you're away from home. You can bring a little comfort into a motel and relax and listen to music you like and it's always good.Pandora is a great station."
"April 10, 2016","Right now it is stuck on buffering whenever I open the app. I tried reinstalling but that didn't work either. Please fix this or let me know what I can do. Thanks."
"July 31, 2017","Pandora is by far the best music app out there. It has music that none if the other apps do. My favorite is hair bands. I love Pandora!"
"September 8, 2017","Pandora is a great concept, and nicely executed. I learned how to use it and am now addicted! I really like the idea of encountering random tracks that fit into a self-created 'station' idea that I didn't choose directly. I'm still learning how to use its management capabilities, but I've come to use it quite a lot, as over the air radio in non-urban areas (heck, even in urban areas!) leaves a lot to be desired these days. Try it, learn it, you'll love it!"
"July 24, 2017","Didn't like all the commercials.. but other then that its awesome..."
"April 18, 2015","For my listening genres (electronic new age/relaxation/concentration), the selection seems to be very thin and repetitive. Add to the limited skipping of unwanted selections, it was a no-brainer not to renew this after my year expired. I did discover Ulrich Strauss, for which I'll be eternally grateful :-)."
"January 25, 2014","I have been a longtime Pandora One subscriber. Until recently, I have made the jump to Sirius XM satellite radio. Why? Much more variety. Not to mention 160+ live channels. All music channels can be catered to the end user's taste with MyXM it has 6 skips an hour limit, but doesn't make me feel bad. Because there is always something new to listen to. Pandora has become stale. If I Don't suggest a new artist the station keeps playing the same stuff over and over again. Sirius is worth the dough."
"September 22, 2013","I used it when I heard an artist was coming to play in our town and I was unfamiliar with their works. I plugged in the name of the artist and heard some of his works, but also heard other performers who were similar in style. As it turns out, I was familiar with some of the associated artists so it gave me a better idea if I would like to go hear the live performance of the original artist. This is a great resource for an introduction into new artists and genres."
"December 22, 2015","While Pandora is nice, the free version plays a hundred times more ads than Spotify. Spotify also offers full minute commercials and then plays for half an hour. I do like how I can filter out explicit content, which is something I cannot do on Spotify."
"November 20, 2016","It is great."
"October 20, 2017","I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from. There is no cost to listen and enjoy unless you choose to upgrade. I like to be able to listen to a variety of Gospel music such as Country/Southern, Black Gospel and some more modern. It allows me to select, and then just run the shuffle of music to get the variety. Also I like to use it at school at times in my K2 class, using Christian Childrens music in our Christian school."
"May 27, 2013","When I was younger I would only really listen to whatever people happen to give to me, which was usually pop stuff given to me by my older sister. Now that I'm branching out more and finding my own music I find pandora to be pretty great for new suggestions. Music by people I'd never heard of before or even songs that I loved but hadn't heard in forever and didn't know or forgot the names of have been suggested to me and there's nothing quite like finding a long lost song to make your day. :)"
"April 11, 2012","Absolutely Fabulous! I enjoy the quality of the music and my favorite artist from new age t trance and dance music."
"July 1, 2017","Good to have on my kindle fire for quick music"
"August 22, 2017","I've enjoyed Pandora very much. A co-worker has it on her phone, and liked what I heard. You have a variety of choices in music to choose from. I'm very happy with it. I have it on my Kindle."
"May 3, 2017","Are you still listening? Every thirty minutes? Really Pandora? Every thirty minutes? Goodbye Pandora. Hello any other music streaming service. Are you still listening?"
"January 11, 2017","As a Pandora One user, I have no complaints. I use Pandora as an alarm and I they have great suggestions for radio stations and adding songs to my existing playlists."
"August 23, 2017","useful app and works like it should"
"November 7, 2014","I like Pandora and I use it on both my laptops so I thought it only natural to use it on my Kindle. I was not overly impressed with the Kindle version. It only wants to show the history of the group or artist. Where is the lyrics? I like to see the lyrics sometimes and it is fun to see what they really say as opposed to what people think.... Like I do sometimes."
"February 14, 2014","I love that I can type in a band that I love and it finds others similar for me! makes it alot easier to find music you enjoy and it has the thumbs up or down so that if you really like a song just hit the thumb up and it will play songs similar to its type and if you don't then it the thumbs down! You can add as many bands to the same radio channel as you want and it will shuffle all of those bands for you. I just love it!"
"September 5, 2017","I LOVE AND CANNOT REALLY EXIST - EXAGGERATING - without it. Live in a rural community with few stations and few options.I selected my last phone because it plays Pandora so well."
"June 14, 2014","I installed the app on my pc, phone and tablet at the same time. I checked to see if they were working by playing them. No way to turn the app off , you have to pause the playing which leaves the app running but not playing. I got an email from Pandora wanting to know what I was doing with the app running on 3 devices. I guess they think i'am passing it around!! Pandora offered the option to install the App on other devices. A good little fix would be a stop button on the App. Oh by the way I'm a paying customer!"
"July 12, 2014","I love Pandora and listen to it all the time, on my computer, my Ipad and especially my Sonos system. For the latter, it is pretty seamless and the ads in the free version are not terribly intrusive. The sound quality is great, and I usually (but not always) get music I enjoy.  That said, Pandora seems a bit confused about what I call my Uplifting music station. Most of the time it works great. I get my favorite kinds of music consisting of Kirtan, Irish piano riffs and some beautiful, moving classical music. But at least once a day, my happy reverie is invaded when suddenly I am bombarded with loud and offensive rap music such as Moki complete with swear words. What the @#$*&^?? I always give these a thumbs down and the specific song goes away, only to have some other piece pop its head in the following day or even immediately after! Makes me wonder what it is about my other song choices that feeds into Pandora's algorithm fooling it into picking something so off the wall. Just curious - and mildly annoyed. And yeah, it is free so I give it ALMOST 5 stars."
"February 18, 2013","I am still new to the touch screen stuff so am still learning how to touch the screen. Previous to getting the Kindle I accessed Pandora with a PC. The web browser interface has lots more flexibility. However, for use on Kindle the one-touch simpler interface is OK for listening in the back yard and around the house. As advertised the Kindle sounds great playing pandora and sounds even better with Bose headphones plugged in. My pandora lists are vocalists and instrumentals, no heavy rock or hip-hop with heavy bass."
"February 1, 2014","and/or jumping rope. I love the music of course..but THOSE FREQUENT ADVS. are a pain. I have to stop running..click the corner ""X"" and then it takes some time for the song to continue...sometimes I have to close the app. then re-open I know it's FREE so I do understand. The frequency of advs. DOES make me think about subscribing for $4/monthly if that means NO ADVS. EVER! But the variety of music is impressive and again--IT'S FREE!"
"January 26, 2015","I like pandora. It gives you the option of likeing or dislikeing, skipping a song, looking at previously herd songs, and making different personalized radio stations. Only problem: it can play really cool songs, and it can play really, really bad songs that you won't know why pandora thought you'd like. Overall though, it's pretty cool."
"May 9, 2017","I like this app cause it helps me sleep and i enjoy listing to the music that they provide me."
"September 16, 2017","I love Pandora and I wish I would have heard about it years ago."
"April 29, 2017","Great selection of music. Pick your favorite artist and listen with very little interruptions. Short commercials are ok. I bought a Jam speaker and blutooth from my iPhone, working outside bring your music with you. This is a great way to listen to the music you love."
"October 28, 2011","I am happy now. Now that Pandora's free membership comes with unlimited playback I want Pandora everywhere and, thanks to this, Pandora is on my XOOM now.  Pandora is elegant and flawless on Honeycomb. The screen is less cluttered than the PC version with nothing but the album cover, the thumbs up/down icons, an 'info' button that opens up artist and song info screens and the playback controls. I like that option to blank the screen while layback continues. And Pandora keeps playing while other apps are in use - tried it with the browser and a couple of games.  The Android settings menu allows you to tweak a few parameters:  - Play quality high/normal - Auto screen lock on/off - Auto shutdown in low memory situations - Bluetooth on/off  It's perfection (with some ads popping up).  -- >> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<"
"May 11, 2015","Great for all your listening needs very limited commercials. .any type of music you can think of."
"June 25, 2017","I enjoy listening to my Pandora very much."
"May 30, 2015","Spotify is WORLDS better and the premium is a rip off! $4.99 a month!? It's barely worth a lifetime membership for $4.99 and the only reason I was signed up is because I accidentally tapped to close to sign up instead of no thanks on the free version and there was conveniently no ""are you sure"" screen next just went right ahead and signed me up for an auto renewing membership. Canceling it is not as simple as one easy click. It can be tricky to find where to cancel your membership once your signed up if your not to families with whatever device you are running it on. I used to enjoy the free version but didn't like having no choice in what actually played after seeing what little difference the premium version makes for the price I will never be on pandora again even if the premium was free."
"August 2, 2013","Awesome app. Downloaded it for use on my kindle fire and it works great. Although there are several competitors out there including Apple's (a direct shameful pandora rip off that would never have seen the light of day if Steve Jobs were still alive) and I heart radio; Pandora has been around for over a decade and they are simply the best. They have tried and true algorithms and the more you use it the better it gets. Far and away the best. I definitely recommend."
"December 6, 2012","Not sure what has happened to Pandora, but the annoying way the ads are, and the amount, are terrible. I used to be jealous of all the people at work with Pandora when all I had was Slacker on my Windows phone. I now have the Droid Razr Maxx HD and have Pandora, Slacker, and Iheart Radio. I have to say I am not jealous anymore. This is how I would rank the three apps I have listed: 1. Slacker 2. Iheart Radio 3. Pandora Luckily all these apps are free so you can try them yourself and decide which is best for you."
"April 29, 2016","I love, love, love Pandora! I use it when I teach exercise classes, when I workout, cook, clean etc. My children love the Kidzbop station and frequently have dance parties. I like that I can play it on my phone, tv, iPad etc."
"February 10, 2016","it always on in my office love it"
"February 2, 2014","I love Pandora. It plays in the background while I do other things on my laptop or my Kindle. I can have Pandora playing on my laptop while I work in the kitchen or do household chores. You pick the artists you like, Pandora plays those and similar artists. I often hear something from an artist I never heard before, like it, and buy the CD for my collection."
"October 24, 2017","what i listen to when doing work in the yard or upstairs house work. Love it"
"April 19, 2017","Spotify is so much better you don't have a skip limit and there is less adds"
"December 27, 2014","I am addicted to Pandora. It has a wonderful assortment of old time music. I love the Big Band, New Orleans Jazz, Boogie Woogie, 40's, 50's, as well as classical, classic Christmas was WONDERFUL, also old country(Patsy Cline and others). Please stay as great as you are. I fear this world is not going to know what real music is anymore if you change."
"February 13, 2014","This is a great app that you can configure to your style. You can thumbs up, or thumbs down songs to inform them of what music that you prefer. You make different stations and can set them up in different genres to your liking. The commercials are not too frequent, which is surprising. I have no complaints with this app. It is free and the music is too, a wonderful addition to your kindle. Hope that helps."
"September 18, 2017","Still my favorite music app."
"November 16, 2016","5 stars"
"August 16, 2017","if you like music get this."
"June 15, 2014","I really like Pandora, but the only complaint I have is that when you create a station, after a while the songs start to get repetitive and it is hard to keep the station fresh. You basically have to add an artist to the station to get some fresh songs in there, but even then it gets a little stale after a while. However, it's free and it works. The stream does not get interrupted unless you have a really weak signal. It's a great way to hear some new music or artists you were otherwise not familiar with."
"November 1, 2016","Great music"
"December 9, 2015","Great app for kids - even if you do have to listen to a few ads periodically for the free version. I like that you can choose any artist or song and the app will select other songs in the same genre to compliment your choices."
"November 16, 2016","AA++"
"January 23, 2015","Pandora is wonderful! I can listen to my favorite categories of music across multiple devices easily. The free service only has advertisements every 20 minutes - much better than other audio broadcast venues! If that's still too much, they offer a subscription service which eliminates all ads. Pretty cool!"
"November 7, 2012","This service has been able to do what I have always wanted to do with music; create and play dynamic playlists. The parameters that they assign music allows users to create stations and focus the dynamics of the playlist as one listens. It can focus to a such a fine degree to where I have to delete stations and re-create them just to expand the music content. I run this on PC's, media players and tablets. My music collection has been off loaded. The subscription cost is very reasonable and makes the music seamless for hours."
"August 14, 2017","We really enjoy Pandora"
"May 9, 2014","After being a paying member I still run out of skips. That is annoying. I'm not sure that the like/dislike is properly done since it seems to affect multiple channels and multiple artists.  The Pandora APP on the cell phone I would never use. They insist they have access to everything. GPS, email, contacts, etc. Nope."
"August 15, 2014","It's AWESOME. Some of the secretary's at work would listen to Pandora on their computers. So I decided to download the app to my Kindle Fire. I needed a little pick me up the other day. I love listening to Chris Tomlin and some of the other Christian Artist's. What a blessing! I can carry the music with me from room to room, outside or in the car. That's why I've rated the app 5 stars."
"October 20, 2016","Use a lot !!"
"March 14, 2015","If you're looking for loud quiet or everything in between Pandora has the right sound for you."
"June 4, 2015","I grew up with radio and love the reduced advertising and great genres that can be created on Pandora. I'm not really one to use ear buds since I'm an artist and need to be unencumbered when I'm working. Just turn on the computer, plug in speakers and ""Bob's your uncle""!"
"July 19, 2014","What can I say about Pandora other than it is fabulous! First of all, spend the money and upgrade your membership to Premium and get the CD quality and no ads. While I do not get to play exactly what selection I want from an artist, I can select that artist. I find that I like my CDs better when I want to listen to a particular album but this sure beats satellite and fm."
"August 18, 2017","Love it. Awesome app."
"October 27, 2016","Love it!"
"November 1, 2016","My favorite stations are Miles Davis and Nora Jones."
"April 3, 2014","I have unlimited minutes on my phone. I like to use Pandora to accompany me every where I go. I have several favorite stations and switch them to match my mood. One thing I really like is I can set a timer to turn it off whenever I want to use it to serenade me before I go to sleep. I can also wake to music if I so choose. I also use it on my computer but not as often as I do on my phone."
"October 21, 2016","Very nice. Use it all the time. Thank you."
"April 7, 2013","This app only allows you to listen to music 40 hours a month a some people like to listen to music a lot and it suck that it allows 40 hours of listening to music it makes me feel like a kid like I'm time on the amount of music I listen to"
"May 1, 2017","Love how I can look for one artist and Pandora finds comparable music to listen to! My go to at work for sure."
"July 24, 2017","Awesome mix of music......"
"February 14, 2014","I do love Pandora but do have an issue with them. I designed my own 'stations' and Pandora inserts music on my comedy station and vice versa (you get my drift..) so I have to hit the thumbs down sign each time.. Well, they keep doing this on all my 'stations'. I know I'm being picky but it does get annoying when 4+ times in a row I have to hit the thumbs down sign. We only get so many dislikes at a time.."
"October 20, 2016","Love pnor"
"November 1, 2017","I am so very addicted to Pandora. I only sometimes wish there were a few more skips allowed, but still a great thing all around ! I recommend thumbprint radio !"
"August 19, 2017","Without my knowledge or permission my free Pandora was switched to Pandora Premium Trial. I requested assistance but their response is I have to return to the entity where I requested the trial. There is no way I can do what they demand since I did not request a trial."
"April 2, 2014","I love jazz and cannot tolerate rap and hip hop. Pandora has every genre of music from country to opera. I listen to John Coltrane, Michael Buble and an ocassional Fleetwood Mac and Elton John if I feel like it. The ads are a little troublesome but I don't mind because I get to hear the channels I chose. If you don't want the ads you can upgrade to Pandora One for an extra few bucks."
"September 26, 2017","I don't really use pandora anymore,they play old music."
"July 5, 2017","Great streaming music app!"
"March 6, 2016","Great App to stream music tuned just for you. You can set-up channels just to your mode or taste and filter down to the type of music you like. Probably a 4.5 star. Would be a 5 without the ads, but you they have to pay for the music and make money too."
"July 29, 2017","WOW ! I luv this !"
"November 18, 2015","I listen to Pandora always. I enjoy the endless music selections and the ability to create my stations. Whether oldies, current, decade focused or movie music. I can always find something I am in the mood to listen to! Thanks, Pandora!"
"December 3, 2015","Just found out about Pandora on Thanksgiving and I love it. Have been listening to some wonderful Christmas music ever since. Also found alot of great old classic country music. So fan it's been a lot of fun."
"January 23, 2013","I've been a Pandora fan for years, and now, having it on my Kindle makes discovering and listening to music much easier. Pandora is such a great thing; I will always be a fan."
"August 18, 2017","Love the music"
"October 17, 2016","Just update and now getting ""internal error, are you connected to the Internet "" and "" you do not own this app"" errors."
"August 16, 2017","Love smooth Jazz"
"June 17, 2014","This app is great. I have it on my Android Phone and I can't like, dislike, skip songs, or do anything without the app eventually freaking out and playing up to 4 songs at once before it finally lets me quit the app and relaunch it. But the Pandora App on my Kindle Fire HD is great. I can skip songs, like, dislike, etc. without worrying about it freaking out on me."
"May 19, 2016","I love PANDORA with the reason, I am fond of Music, every step of the way, I on the PANDORA. It's give me ENERGY and HAPPINESS, so my work done so easy, unbelievable. Some Music get me going dancing, in the car or home, make me awake in the night driving.Oh, PANDORA IS GREAT BELIEVE ME."
"June 2, 2014","I like this program. it allows me to choose what I d like to listen to and when. I have a wide range of music I like to listen to from classic to swing to early rock to easy listening, big bands and so forth. this provides me an opportunity to listen to them all. great program."
"August 2, 2017","Pandora rules."
"September 1, 2017","works great!"
"August 30, 2017","Easy to use."
"February 4, 2016","I pay for commercial free access - it is great to create your own stations to fit any mood with songs you have never heard, songs you have not heard in a very long time, and all commercial free - I LOVE IT"
"October 25, 2016","A+"
"September 23, 2016","I love having access to music from my Kindle, it makes reading even more enjoyable for me! No issues with the app. Downloading was quick, it runs smoothly with no errors."
"November 24, 2012","This is my all time favorite radio stations of all time. great variety of channels to choose from. I can listen to it on the go or while I am at home."
"May 24, 2017","Well here's what 9+10 is it must be decillion! It's great it has the stations you want plus suggestions of what you might like!"
"September 5, 2017","Good Stuff"
"October 25, 2016","after listening to a few songs every channel says it's unavailable. so I only get to listen to music for about ten minutes. same for phones and kindle fire hdx"
"July 4, 2013","My first time trying Pandora and I have to say I enjoy it very much.The ease in selecting different genres is very pleasing. the music selection is very current"
"December 18, 2013","I do not care for this one.  I do not even understand why I would want to put all of my information online for someone else to see and have not control over who sees it. I guess I am too private for this app. I believe it came with the Kindle as maybe some of the others on here for me to review that I do not remember downloading at all...  I thank Amazon for the Free apps of the day!!!"
"January 8, 2016","Marvelous selection of music for every music taste. We find a lot of composers and albums we did not know about and have purchased some of their music. Can be switched from one music type to another easily."
"November 8, 2016","love it"
"August 17, 2017","I shall to listen to my 50~60~70 music jazz,clasical,psychedelic, music"
"September 5, 2017","Gets great music!"
"September 8, 2013","This app is NOW great! The first time I got this app I could not get it to work well at all. I could get a few songs to play and then it froze up. All I had was a blue Pandora screen. I deleted the app for 3 days. Today I loaded Pandora app again. Now it works perfectly the way I want, alot of music that I love made up into stations that I can play any time. Plays on my Kindle Fire HD in the back- ground as I do other web searches,etc. Wow this is great."
"April 7, 2014","I really did not think it would follow my tastes, as the first artist I entered was lutenist Nigel North. Lovely, I was transported to the world of early music for a full afternoon while I painted from my Kindle. It has nicely followed my next entry, composer Nikolai Korsakov. Not a problem. Another afternoon of Russian romantic music, orchestral. How did I live without this?"
"July 28, 2017","Always great to have so many musical choices from Pandora. Easy to use."
"September 24, 2017","Pandora is a great way to listen to my favorites and to find new favorites!"
"September 27, 2013","I first started using Pandora on my laptop. Having it loaded on my Android smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD is even better. Able to play my stations in the kitchen the bedroom, the car and anywhere is fabulous. The user interface is good and easy to figure out. The only issue I have is that the touch buttons are so small on the screen it is hard to hit them accurately. For example, the X that you use to close an advertisement and the menu to quit or change stations. But other than that, it works like a charm. I am a big fan of Pandora as a way to listen to music."
"September 3, 2015","I love Pandora. I listen to lots of different music, especially latin salsa, bachata, merengue. I would give it a 5 except that in each venue, the list of music is limited. You keep hearing the same songs over and over. Pandora really needs to offer more songs."
"March 7, 2014","Really like Pandora - have stored on smartphone - especially like custom stations Only problem when connected to car phone and using Bluetooth am unable to access what is playing and the indicate favorite or not unless disconnect from car radio - most difficult to do while driving which is why have in 1st place. Even ads are not disruptive but this lack of control cause to NOT rate a 5"
"October 7, 2017","Music choices galore!"
"September 26, 2017","Love it."
"September 3, 2017","Love it"
"January 2, 2014","I love Pandora. I have the premium package but the free version is good too. I love the ability to have customizable music by genres. This was especially a wonderful app during Christmas when I could THUMBS UP or THUMBS DOWN any Christmas selection I liked or disliked. When Christmas rolls around again, Christmas station will be even better. I love a variety of music and Pandora IS the app for music lovers."
"February 29, 2016","What else can I say, I absolutely love Pandora Radio. Once you create a channel that you like, I can listen to it for hours at a time! It knows exactly what I love and plays more of it! Love Love Love!"
"August 27, 2017","On the go your way"
"March 10, 2015","I love my Pandora. Such versatility, wide range of music selections. Love being able to customize stations and preferences. Also love being able to train my programs by giving tracks a thumbs up or thumbs down. I don't really listen to the radio anymore....just my iTunes and Pandora!"
"January 31, 2014","I drive an activities bus for the school district and the majority of the buses are retired route buses with broken, or more often, no radios. Pandora let's me use my Kindle, Iphone, and ipod to instantly stream the music I want to hear by my favorite artist. I often stream it on my ipod at home while I'm cleaning around the house. No more blaring stereo to hear your tunes around the house!!"
"September 4, 2015","Not a day goes by that I don't play my favorite artists on Pandora. Whether on my Kindle, my cell or my laptop Pandora is always there playing what I enjoy listening to and not what someone else likes. Even with the rare commercial breaks, its ok, because, it's RARE. I LOVE MY PANDORA!"
"May 13, 2017","Great tunes to jerk my meat to....😈"
"August 18, 2017","I truly enjoy Pandora !!! What a great way to listen to all the types of music you like !!!"
"May 8, 2016","It's great! Unbelievable wide user selected library of music"
"October 8, 2014","I like Pandora. Use it everyday. Not fond of the shuffle choices. I have multiple stations of different music interest, blues, ambient, country, rock n roll and so much more. Some days I am in the mood for country and would like to shuffle the music from my country stations. Some days I am a little bit country and rock n roll but not ambient or blues so I would like to shuffle just those."
"September 3, 2017","good"
"October 17, 2016","Just really good!"
"June 4, 2017","Same songs keep playing over and over. Would like newer songs and more variety."
"March 23, 2016","Loaded this Pandora App...on my amazon tablet .....loads up quickly..... And plays any song that you want ....or you can make a play list....no waiting for it to buffer ,like the old days...."
"October 28, 2017","installed Pandora app for Kendle a few years ago. worked great until a few weeks ago. Now says it can't connect to Pandora. Tried uninstall. This moved the defective program to the cloud. Told it to reinstall, so it recovered the defective program from the cloud, and it still doesn't work. can't find a way to delete from the cloud and install a fresh (working) copy."
"November 21, 2016","I love Pandora the music is great you can have more than one station. You have made this station affordable for people who can't afford to pay for a station thanks"
"March 22, 2014","I like Pandora because it seems to be a ""smarter"" program than most. When I type in an artists it does a pretty good job of giving me things I would/could like. The downsides are that it doesn't seem to reach out into the realm of eccentricity and expose me to new artists as much as I would like AND you can't choose specific songs to listen to or build stations from."
"August 27, 2013","Have used Pandora both on PC, Laptop and now Fire. Splendid sound from the Fire; just keeps me either relaxing or rock and roll while working in the home."
"May 24, 2016","Love the amount of songs available in all music genres. Hate that it takes forever to yea or nae your favorite songs while setting up your favorite station."
"October 3, 2015","Overall, Pandora has a seemingly infinite array of music available for playing and I love to discover new music and artists that I might like. I really find the fine-tuning feature helpful because it allows you to obtain a more specific music taste. Thanks to Pandora, I now regularly listen to Melanie Martinez, Marina and The Diamonds, Lana del Rey, and many other amazing artists I'd never think I'd discover. It's a great app for those who wish to expand their personal music library."
"August 10, 2017","Pandora sucks. Set up a ""station"" based on one of my favorite bands and played for two hours without actually playing a song by that band. Pandora also keeps trying to play music by bands I can't stand (guns and roses, ac-dc) because they are in the same genre as other music i like even though they are talentless."
"February 12, 2016","Always loved Pandora on my desktop - so glad to not be tied down to one location. Love bringing Pandora from room to room or out on vacation, where I'm not familiar with the local radio stations."
"December 29, 2013","I do like it, but am having some trouble navigating it. For one thing I can't figure out how to turn it off without turning off the whole Kindle. I absolutely wish Amazon would include at least SOME instruction pamphlet with the Kindle other than how to turn it on, how to charge it and how to ""swipe."" I do not have a smart phone or IPad, so have to really learn how to navigate this device, and it's not as easy as some would have you believe!"
"March 25, 2016","in this day and age I don't really like some one or (something) choosing my music for me then turning off after inactivity hit me with comercials no thanks its Spotify for me"
"January 7, 2017","Great radio,I can listen to the music all day Although sometimes it puts music by other artists that I hate,I can still change the songs,You can download it if you would like this greatest music radio ever"
"August 1, 2016","I love Pandora and always have, it's never crashed on me and it doesn't take as much data as all of the other music streaming apps."
"July 18, 2017","thank you"
"June 10, 2014","I think it is wonderful to be able to access so many different types of music and even get a little background on the groups and see lyrics. The only thing that's needed to make this 5 stars would be more relevant music choices when you choose an artist. As an example I chose Beach Boys and the subsequent music will be a different style from the 50's."
"May 20, 2016","Love being able to a wide range of music any time I am in the mood."
"July 22, 2015","The app is fantastic. I love listening to music when I'm driving or working; however, it is very buggy. I have yet to listen to the app for a solid hour without issues. Usually, it just needs restarted, so it's not a serious problem, but it does get annoying."
"March 4, 2016","After trying their ""60 day free trial,"" I wanted to keep their paid service but was not able to. They took my credit card information and it was my understanding that I would automatically continue to receive the premium version. However, I went back to the free version and I was not even able to go on their website and activate the premium version. I sent several emails to them and no-one resolved it or even attempted to see what happened. In other words, they had a someone who wanted to be their customer but couldn't and still can't!"" Not the way to run a business."
"November 12, 2016","I love using Pandora!!!! Love hearing the music I choose!!!"
"December 2, 2012","Pandora is my go-to source for any artist or song that I want to listen to. In addition, you create radio presets/stations for your favorite artist, group, genera of music even comedian. each time you sign in, you can listen to your stations or create new ones. The possibilities are endless. Its free with some ads or you can subscribe for a low monthly fee of $3.99 month or 36.00 a year. give it a try, Im sure that you will find your favorite song, artist or comedian."
"October 21, 2013","Pandora is the only app that I can be on for more than 2 hours!!! I love how you are able to communicate with people with the same interests as you, plus leave comments on your fave songs!! It plays all my favorite music!!! Nothing bad to report, just that leaving comments on other people's profiles might not go through... so beware!!! But other than that, best app ive ever had!!!!   - Directioner4eva"
"July 19, 2017","wonderful music"
"January 7, 2015","I love Pandora. The site, anyway. I can listen to almost anything I want there, and on the site, there's nothing that threatens my computer. The app, on the other hand, is highly invasive and has a virus on a file. I will keep using the site, but I'll be looking for another app for my Kindle."
"September 8, 2013","Pandora simply ROCKS, you can listen to music on it, and create your own stations, give thumbs up or thumbs down to songs, and much, much more. I pay a dollar only a month for it, but I could pay $4 for Pandora one a month, it allows you to skip as many tracks as you want, and doesn't have any advertisements popping up like regular pandora I prefer. YOU GET IT, then decide after the free trial if you are to upgrade it, leave it the way it is, or stop using it. Your choice."
"June 26, 2015","I really like having music on my Kindle. It is only draw back is when you don't know the internet connection."
"October 10, 2017","Good"
"March 16, 2014","Pandora makes it easy to find new music. Based on my requests, Pandora plays a similar selection of recommendations just for me. I like having the choice to give a new song a ""thumbs up or down"". If I don't like the music, Pandora stops and moves on to the next recommendation. This is great! I have discovered and bought more music in the last year thanks to their recommendations."
"June 20, 2017","I LOVE Pandora radio. No complaints whatsoever."
"September 9, 2017","Great AP... I WOULD RECOMMEND IT!"
"May 20, 2017","great product"
"January 2, 2017","Love it. So nice at Christmas time and love my oldies. Doo wah Diddy."
"August 20, 2017","Fantastic program!"
"November 28, 2016","Alexa calls this up on my Amazon Fire and connects with no difficulty. App works great and it is seamless."
"September 4, 2017","Very good! station I can create for my listening experience"
"October 18, 2013","The new version of Pandora for Kindle Fire has many nice features like a sleep timer and an option to ask to temporarily not hear a tune you are tired of.  I do wish it didn't require so many steps to exit the application and the mini-items to click are difficult for my visually impaired husband to see.  Otherwise it is as wonderful as ever. I definitely recommend the cheep annual subscription to avoid the commercials and have extended play for hours."
"January 4, 2013","I love Pandora and all the stations I'm able to have at my fingertips anywhere! I have to have my music when I'm doing something. I love that I can listen to it on my Kindle fire HD and move it from room to room with ease and it sound great. Before I could only listen to it only at certain times and hauling my laptop from room to room was frustrating. Pandora is great and I tell people about it whenever I have the opportunity plus I'm content with the free version. The ads aren't any trouble for me."
"September 19, 2017","Always a joy. Just put it on a mix and let it go for hours."
"September 5, 2015","Is a great music app, and I love that it has international artists as well. Just sometimes I don't really care so much for the selections chosen for you when you create a station around a certain artist, as sometimes I don't want to hear someone else."
"December 9, 2016","I am really enjoying Pandora on my Samsung Galaxy. A lot of great music and very few commercials."
"November 19, 2016","Love it"
"March 26, 2013","Simply love this app. Am able to create stations based on my interests! I have run the gamut of stations; ie, favorite artists, showtunes, classical, oldies, musicals (contains music from productions, artists, Broadway; example: Momma Mia & Phantom), classical! Unbelievable that is a free app! Doesn't matter that one cannot specify songs as the offerings are so fantastic. Able to input opinion of songs through thumbs up/thumbs down. I have this on my Kindle Fire HD."
"November 30, 2015","Pandora is a great way to listen to so many different genres of music. I really enjoy listening to a specific channel based on an artist and the other music that is mixed with it are very similar. Overall, it is a great app and I would certainly recommend it to my family and friends. The one thing I do not like is how it goes idle after a period of time. I suppose that is a way of ""saving battery power"" or something like that, so it's not too big of a problem."
"July 22, 2017","When it works, it's okay. Not enough skips unless you pay for the month/year (~7)."
"September 4, 2017","I've been listening to Pandora for years they have a great selection of genre and we can rate the music as it is played. Thank you Amazon for having Pandora available and for free"
"August 23, 2017","I love Pandora, it's great to be able to listen to my favorite music at any time.  I lo"
"September 17, 2013","I LOVE Pandora! I like the fact that I create my own stations using my favorite artists as a guideline. Using the thumbs up and down I can control what artists get played more often and who never gets played again. I really have found myself turning off the television and listening to my favorite station because it has been customized for me and plays all good songs! You really can't loose!"
"March 29, 2017","Love this concept. Lots of trouble on my Amazon fire phone. There's no way I could ever even think about upgrading to the no commercials. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. Why can't we all get Pandora's full benefits? If it is not for all phones, just say so and be done with us! You should be able to accommodate Fire phones, others have found a way. You are dragging your feet and we would like some service!"
"January 26, 2017","It's a free app, but I don't like my songs being cut off or my commercials in Spanish. I love the choices Pandora pics for me. I have found some new groups I love."
"November 10, 2012","There is nothing more enjoyable than being able to type in the name of an artist or music genre, then sit back and listen. If a tune comes on that you don't care for, simply click on the ""thumbs-down"" icon, and another song in the genre you have selected begins to play. If you tire of one type of music, simply click and select a new one."
"May 25, 2014","Pandora is great because you hear artists you wouldn't have otherwise, based on your preferences. I would recommend it to anyone that loves music and thrives on finding new artists and genres. My only problem with it is that there are more ads than there used to be and the price of a subscription to get rid of the ads has gone up. However, it is only $4.99/mo, which is affordable and worth the expense."
"April 29, 2017","Works on my Kindle"
"May 8, 2014","This app is so wonderful! I love being able to hear the music and comedy routines that I love without buying anything and without putting up with a D.J. It is just the music I love. I have my oldies and the most current.  The only problem I am having is the wake up to music feature. I may not understand it yet. I just got an alarm with no music."
"May 9, 2017","I've always loved Pandora! Love how they can figure out our tastes and especially now that we can skip back to the previous song! :)"
"August 16, 2017","Very good."
"September 5, 2017","Love it."
"July 28, 2017","Ok"
"November 2, 2015","Love it wish they would play the forties stuff, love the old war years songs, even though I wasn't there..."
"July 19, 2016","Whether I'm cleaning, driving, or need to help my little guy relax...this is my go to app! There is a station for every mood! Love it!"
"January 23, 2014","A great app for music. The ability to create stations by either choosing an artist or music genre makes for great listening. You here only the types of artists you wish to hear."
"January 14, 2015","I listen to Pandora daily when my wife and I are having dinner. I like the thumbs up or thumbs down feature because when I give it thumbs up I get more of that sort of music. When I give it a thumbs down the music goes off immediately. I also like the wide variety of music available."
"March 9, 2017","It Is amazing you type the name of the song you like and they give you a station and it shows you familiar arrest!!!!!!!!!!🎼🎶🎵🎸🎤"
"June 22, 2015","My much beloved spouse likes Pandora very much. He uses it a lot and is quite pleased with it. If he is pleased, then I am delighted. Very very nice."
"March 14, 2014","I love Pandora because it is like public radio, but you can choose what you like and if you don't like a song you can just skip it or dislike it and it skips the song and will not play the song again on the station you disliked it on. Ads aren't too often every 7 or so songs and after skips. If you hats ads you can always get Pandora one, which gives you additional skips, No ads, and on the website you can choose a custom background for $3.99 a month. One downside is I can't use the alarm clock feature because battery life on my kindle fire is really bad on wifi even on standby. I love the sleep time because sometimes I need something to turn off my music if I do fall asleep to help save me from being waken up to turn off the ""loud music"". I don't use the station shuffle much, but it is a cool feature which plays a different station after each song and you can go back to one station play by clicking the station you want."
"August 11, 2013","I love Pandora. I have to say I like it better than any other music source. One can 'make' a radio station and listen to just the music you want. Anything you don't like, give it a thumbs down and you don't hear it again. After a period of time, it's all the stuff one likes to hear. Did I say I love it? Also have it on all 4 computers as well as my cell phone. It don't get any better. Life is good!"
"September 3, 2016","Pandora on my phone/tablet is perfect, pair the phone with blue tooth speaker at work or home, or blue tooth in car and no advertisements or DJs talking to cut into the music."
"February 7, 2017","Works great on my Kindle, thanks."
"July 8, 2015","If you like to listen on Pandora on your computer, this app is a great way to take it with you on the go.  The app works well and is very user friendly. You can easily thumbs up or down any song. You can also pause and skip with ease.  You have all the features of your computer in a great app."
"July 19, 2017","Nice to be able to hear some of the old songs again, most of the radio stations don't really play 'oldies but goodies! Clue. It's not 1990's !"
"July 15, 2016","If you don't have Pandora get it it works amazing."
"December 28, 2014","It may not have as large a music library as some other streaming music services, but it has been around a long time and all of my favorite stations have long since been established through this FREE app. It will always hold a prominent place in my app collection!"
"January 6, 2017","play the same thing over and over, even on shuffle. play artists i don't like even when i have tons listed that i do like!"
"November 13, 2016","Great helps me keep in touch with all the music I love. From generation to generation and different genres"
"June 5, 2017","Great"
"July 16, 2016","Pandora streaming is off-line and I have become a Slacker fan...Pandora streaming to multiple AV receivers has stopped for the past +30-days and Pandora is very slow to resolve this issue like past ones. Not able to listen to Pandora on such receivers so I now found Slacker Radio and use it via the iPod connection. Music selection with minimal 30-second commercials is free and finding better music selection/rotation than my paid Pandora music subscription. I have become a Slacker and goodbye to Pandora!"
"September 6, 2017","Easy to install and use on Echo. Does not have every song I like so far but just started using it so still working on it."
"July 15, 2017","I LOVE IT LIKE SPOTIFY."
"January 30, 2013","Pandora allow you to somewhat pick the music that you like. Somewhat being that if you like a song and indicate as a thumbs up you will get more of the style of music. You don't really get to pick the music you pick the style or similar music. If you do it long enough most of the music that you here will be ones that you like. Since I have loaded Pandora I have almost never turn on television but I do love music. It is simple to figure out easy to understand all you have to do type in a favorite artist or style of music and let it pick the music, all you have to do is give it a thumbs up ( I like it) or thumbs down (I don't like it) It is worth the download. Try it"
"March 31, 2012","I think Pandora is a great app because wen u want to listen to good music its there. I say u should get this app."
"January 20, 2014","It never ceases to amaze me as to how this little Kindle can actually get great music for me, all at the touch of a button! The Kindle enables me to do such fun things, but I especially love being able to carry music with me into any room of my house. The selections played are wonderful, and is just another reason I'm so glad I purchased a Kindle. Pandora is simply amazing and such fun to use!"
"May 27, 2015","Pandora is a great music player and I really enjoy using it. But I found out you need WiFi to use. If you know of a music player you can download on a kindle fire that doesn't need WiFi, plz contact me on Pintrest (Anna Thomas) or on Kik (Peppermentstick). Thank you. :)"
"September 22, 2013","Sure Spotify and Rdio have the social element but music is more personal for me and I'll admit, I am not too involved in social networks. Pandora constantly adjusts and updates music and while it can take a while to curate your station, I still get a random mix of songs I like. I rather like the genre and atmosphere, depending on my mood or what I am doing as opposed to selecting artists."
"August 29, 2017","Loved it but at the time, I had limited Gs so could not play it much. Now I have Slacker, not as good but it will do."
"November 26, 2012","In the area I live, finding a good Contemporary Christian radio station can be difficult. Everything is either a little too country or a little too pop sounding. What I like most about Pandora is that I can tailor it to my taste and don't have to sit through a few songs I don't particularly like to hear one I do like. And I really enjoy that I can create a few different stations to go with the mood I am in on any given day. And if I really love a song I hear it is easy to purchase. I would rate Pandora more stars if possible."
"January 31, 2014","One of the best qualities about Pandora is that they play other music in the genre you've chosen, and this exposes the listener to music they might never have heard or been familiar with. The other bonus is being able to listen to a certain type of music on demand and then switch to totally different kind when the mood strikes. I have at least 5 ""options"" I choose from. Plus, my children can have their own ""stations"" when they are on the computer."
"April 29, 2014","I recently was given a Kindle Fire for my birthday and it had Pandora already loaded on it. Since January, I have been listening to so much GREAT music. I can personalize it many ways according to mood, time of day, etc. The selections that come forth are brilliant and I love the notion of having music at my fingertips whenever I want. Well done, Pandora!!"
"May 2, 2017","Pandora is a good application, I would recommend this application to anyone who enjoys listening to music."
"October 31, 2016","Great."
"August 7, 2015","I had this app for the longest time but just recently when I open the app and select a station, songs continually pop-up (not playing them) they just pop-up and don't stop until I close the app. I don't know if it's just my kindle or the app."
"June 8, 2013","I have Pandora on my Kindle Fire and I use it as background music when I am entertaining so I don't have to figure out what music to play. So far I have only 1 station - cool jazz. I used the thumbs up, thumbs down option and I plan to do more with Pandora when I have more time. I'm not sure if it's my Kindle or Pandora -- after the music has been playing for a while the screen goes black and I can't change anything any more. The music keeps playing for a while and eventually if you don't tell it anything it stops because it thinks you're not listening anymore."
"August 27, 2013","I LOVE Pandora............have it on my phones, TV, Computer etc. I love the option to download and specify certain artists and songs..........creating my own playlist if you will."
"March 10, 2014","I have discovered so many great new artist using this program and my appreciation for music has grown! Plus, it's not just music. There are multiple comedy channels you can discover and that's all my husband and I listen to on long car drives. We love it and I definitely recommend it to any one with a tablet, computer, smart phone, etc. You wont regret it! It is my favorite app!"
"September 19, 2017","Good content and relatively easy to navigate for me as a ""rookie""."
"August 9, 2017","its ok"
"June 3, 2017","Love all the songs i grew up iwth :D"
"November 3, 2012","Pandora is the most wonderful radio station because one is not bombarded by the type of music that is racket to the ears. Simply select the artists you prefer and then Pandora selects similar music by other artists, in addition to the artists of your choice, to play. There are no ridiculous ads to listen to between your favorite songs or radio announcers inanely gabbing to one another (although you will hear a 10 or 15 minute ad infrequently about Pandora). If a song comes on you don't like, just hit skip and it will never be played again. I listen for hours at a time and enjoy it very much, especially the price, free!!"
"April 16, 2014","If you love music this is YOUR app! First, the app is free and so is the music! If your into singers like Taylor Swift or Demi Lovato it gives it you! Or if you like rock bands like Metallica or Nirvana they have it too! All you have to do is search the band/singer name and it will come up. And also if it's your favorite song, you can like it and it will play at times. I love this app and so will you!"
"February 25, 2016","My math teacher puts on pandora during a test and I asked if it would work on my kindle and yet it did so now I use it almost everywhere I go such as shower, before bed, while I'm reading etc. Just one of the best music apps I've ever had"
"August 7, 2017","I love that I can find the exact music I love to hear with very little interruptions and it plays anywhere. I listen to all the time"
"August 4, 2017","I still love using Pandora, but I'm growing tired of commercials and stoppages"
"May 15, 2015","Marketing an account is just stupid. I'm not saying the app is stupid, but I don't want to make an account just for music. Five stars if this feature wasn't there."
"July 21, 2017","This is the BEST on-line music service out there. You can build any playlist you want plus get to hear music the matches your likes."
"July 12, 2016","I listen to Pandora when I just need a good song to get me through the days events or through a few work hard days at school to distress from all of that."
"July 16, 2013","I love this app however, I DESPISE the commercials! Yet how can Pandora pay the bills if I don't pony-up for a subscription for commercial free listening...but doesn't that defeat the idea of free internet radio? Consequently, I'll endure the limited interruptions...it's better than FM. I can select the style of music I'm feeling without having to slit my wrist from being subjected to the no talent, lack of common sense, Bieber."
"July 18, 2017","Great"
"April 29, 2015","So far I have never had it ask with on the Kindle app if ""I am still listening"" so that it a huge advantage to listening to Pandora on the computer. If anyone else has had a different experience I am curious to know about it--so let me know."
"December 30, 2013","Thanks Pandora for being a free app. It is really inspiring to be able to choose the music I love, which helps an accomplishing artist like myself to stay motivated. I play you both on my awesome sound system on my 27inch monitor, as well as on my tablet. I use my quad core computer and monitor n my studio, and my tablet when I am traveling around doing paintings and drawings of clients.  You're a great help to an artist, please stay a free app for me, You're and awesome group! Julie"
"December 27, 2013","I subscribed to Pandora to get rid of the ads and allow it to stay on longer. I was hoping it would let you program in some of your own favorite elements - I knew it wouldn't take a play list, which is fine - but it works about the same as the free station as far as what songs come up. Since I work at my computer, I am right there to like or dislike selections, so with diligence I can get a station to play a very specific sound. I believe with my subscription I also get to click on the likes/dislikes more times per hour. I would recommend the subscription to anyone who uses Pandora a lot and can take the time to ""design"" a station."
"September 15, 2017","Pandora Too many advertisements and they come up where it is easy to accidentally click on the advertisements. Free is good, but not when they put advertisements where you can accidentally click on them."
"March 29, 2016","I love it. I really like how you can type in an artist's name and hear their music and music similar to that artist. Also you can change artist at will."
"April 1, 2014","It's free everywhere - on my phone, in my car, on my TVs, tablets, computers at work, at home. Of course the ads are a bit bothersome but it's free. Sometimes a song comes on I am not fond of so I skip it - can't do that on the radio and it's still free. I love Pandora. The variety available just by entering an artist's or group's name is amazing - even somewhat obscure names will bring a good mix of music in that genre or style."
"July 25, 2017","It's alright."
"December 14, 2016","Pandora is fantastic. The music selection for each station is so enjoyable and creative. Listening to Pandora is loaded with pleasure."
"July 18, 2017","Love this app, great music"
"October 17, 2017","Wish we could have more stations, we've maxed out our 100"
"August 28, 2017","I listen to it all the time out at my pool. Good relaxing music!"
"November 15, 2013","It starts and stops at the weirdest times. I'm all happy enjoying my music and then it will stop. I'm not that happy about this. Also, it keeps ""suggesting"" that I up grade, which means a monthly fee. This maybe how they get you to upgrade, starting and stopping. I am going to look into other media."
"July 29, 2017","Used to be better before all the commercials and it times out way too quickly now. Thanks for selling out Pandora."
"July 27, 2017","Love setting up my own likes and groups."
"March 28, 2017","I love it!!!"
"July 19, 2016","I love Pandora more than any other app i have! They give me everything i want in music! They are totally Awesome. You should try this app! I love them!!!"
"August 6, 2017","Great!!!!"
"September 11, 2013","I am a music lover music makes me feel better when I'm mad happy sad and so and I love to listen to music when I do homework or I'm cleaning or when I'm bored and this app helps me listen to all my favorite songs for free I love how I can type in an artist like one direction or katy Perry and other artist I love this app and works really good so I love it very much it's awesome and that's why I would give it ten stars ifi could and take it from a teenage music lover I love this app"
"July 31, 2015","Love all the channels...... especially Shuffle because I can pick stations to shuffle. I have Pandora on my phone, computer, TV and tablet. My favorite station is Pop 80's and a couple that I created. Loggins and Messina and Peter Frampton....."
"January 31, 2014","We love making our own stations - like Disney for the kids. This way, they can listen to all the music from their favorite movies. Plus, mom & dad can have a station too. As many as you want with different genres. We can play it on our tablets, phones and TV. It's a win-win when cleaning the house or just wanting some peaceful background music."
"September 2, 2015","Free Pandora is awesome but you have commercials every Five or six songs. That's okay because it is free. You can pay and get no commercials. I've found some amazing bands that I would have never known existed. Thanks"
"September 7, 2017","Love it!"
"August 22, 2017","I love that you are able to create your own genre stations, just don't like all the commercials. I love that its free."
"October 20, 2017","Love it! Personalized listening. Use this in my car pretty much exclusively - beats paying for Sirius XM because I have more control of what I hear and don't hear. Also beats all of the commercials and chit chat on local stations. Uses very little cellular data which is excellent. I have the free version; there are commercials, but I don't mind as they are way less frequent than commercial radio.  I no longer have 15 minutes of talk during my 20 min drive to work -- can listen to more upbeat stuff to wake me in the morning, podcasts for interesting stuff, and more mellow favorites as I de-stress on the drive home."
"June 3, 2017","Great music you can pick music to whatever mood you are feeling it is a good pick me up when you're feeling down I am happy very happy with Pandora"
"April 5, 2016","The last update broke it. I only get a blue screen with pandora in the center and 7.0 in the lower right hand corner. After that it goes black sometimes locking up my Galaxy S5 phone."
"August 12, 2017","Too many issues with the app not loading"
"July 30, 2017","Love Pandora!"
"May 2, 2013","I love Pandora. It is very nice being able to listen to only music that you like. I originally subscribed to Pandora on my computer and really don't plan on using it on my Kindle. If there is any downside to Pandora it is that there is not as much variety as I would like. By that I mean that if you put an artist on Pandora you may only have a small number of that artist's songs available. Therefore you may have to listen to 5 or 10 songs by that artist over and over."
"July 13, 2017","no good"
"June 13, 2017","Good Apt"
"June 7, 2013","Its pretty great, but there were soooooo many commercials and adds. I pushed through it, but THEN they limited the amount of time you can listen on mobile devices, and I drive all the time so at that point it was stop using it or pay the $3 a month... I upgraded, and its better now but its still very irritating that they always do this ""are you still listening"" nonsense. My response is, ""NOT ANYMORE BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO DRIVE AND YOU JUST SHUT OFF MY MUSIC."" I still use it constantly though so at the end of the day I suppose that should say something."
"September 7, 2015","I've had Pandora on my computer for years. Recently downloaded to my Kindle Fire. Now all I have to do is figure out how to connect (again) to my bluetooth capable sound bar. Pandora is easy to use and to accept or reject various songs."
"January 23, 2016","Pandora is a great app....when I'm away from the Internet then the song's stops playing .....then I have to switch to a different app called Headphones Google play music. ...when the data comes on. ...the play music app works with Internet and without. .."
"October 13, 2017","Very good app"
"May 14, 2013","Pandora is free if you don't mine once in a while a no irrating comercial. I love it. Plus you can tell them what you like and don't like with the thumbs up or thumbs down. Plus this app give you more that what is on your DVD player. It tell you information about the artist. I love my music and I have many different types I like to listen to. This Pandora app keeps up with all of my likes and dislikes. It is like my personal disk jocky without the mouth and chatty conversations."
"January 1, 2015","Pandora seems fine as long as your taste in music runs to current and popular works. If you want something more eclectic, not so hot. Or perhaps they're targeting people under 40, with only lip service to older demographics. The diversity of content of people who want music that was popular prior to 1980 is fairly sparse, and basically lumped together based on the year rather than format. There's just no other explanation for putting Jerry Lee Louis and Dean Martin on the same play list supposedly geared to 1950s rock n roll. Of course, you can ""skip"" the Dean Martin song, but if you also skip the Frank Sinatra and Perry Como songs that immediately follow, you exceed your ""skip"" quotient with the ""free"" version. Basically, even with contemporary music, I find their alogrithms in need of either code writers with a better understanding of the various music genres or much tighter parameters. I have seen very little improvement in this during the past 5 years with ""stations"" I try to construct, so it gets longer and longer between the times I actually use Pandora. Do have to say that their ""Rockin Holidays Radio"" station pretty much delivered on its promise, so there is someone in programming that ""gets it."" Hopefully that person will have a larger role in the overall experience going forward."
"June 15, 2017","Wonderful!!"
"July 18, 2017","I have been with Pandora for years and enjoy the music channels I have set up. Would recommend for everyone !!!"
"April 20, 2017","love it"
"October 2, 2013","I've been using Pandora for years and I have I on all my devices, my Optimus and iPad. I have tried other music app as well, but I always end up going back to Pandora. I really love the recent changes they've made to it like the ability to add variety to your stations and being able to preview and listen to new albums before they're released. If you love a variety of music and want to be able to actually choose some your own selections of songs, you'll love this app. Pandora is one of those apps that you absolutely need o have on your device if you love music. There's no way you'll be disappointed with it."
"September 6, 2017","Love it!!!"
"June 12, 2017","Finally. Some Pandora love. Lets just hope Amazon keeps up with the updates. If theres one app that should be updated when need be, its this one."
"August 8, 2014","Every song I even think about listening to is on there! It's like listening to the radio but with limited commerical interruption. I have my favorite stations I can have and delete the ones, I don't want. Every genre is represented and you also can shuffle between radio stations. I am totally in LOVE!!!"
"May 20, 2017","Love Pandora"
"June 29, 2014","I love it when I can't sleep or want to hear new things. I use Pandora mostly on my Kindle and never on my phone. It is miraculous how you can tailor a station to what you want to hear and are exposed to like music. I have a lot of music downloaded to my Kindle, but use Pandora when I have a wi-fi connection."
"August 20, 2017","Good streams and variety of music!"
"August 17, 2013","I love Pandora! It is free ( at least for now tho' I heard a rumor that they were going to start charging, at which time I'll cancel) and you are able to bookmark songs and groups, build a list of ""stations"" to listen to, and change and alter items according to your listening habits. My taste runs pretty eclectic from an Eddie Cochran station to Mumphord and Sons. So give a trial run and I think you'll become a Pandora fan."
"November 20, 2012","I love Pandora! its my favoriot and most visited app. the only problem is you can only skip 6 times."
"January 7, 2014","I love Pandora and listened through the occasional commercials for free for years. Recently, I finally discovered how totally cheap a subscription is (just a couple of bucks a month!) and signed up as a paying customer. No more ads --- wish I'd not been so cheap and done it years ago.  Only down side: my girlfriend likes the availability of lyrics and has to sing along..."
"November 6, 2015","Absolutely amazing online music streaming app. Great variety with an exceptional ability to customize each specific playlist. Also has a great ability to suggest songs that you wouldn't normally listen to, but are a similar type of music as the playlist you're listening to."
"July 14, 2013","I love love loved Pandora because I could listen free to music all the time on my tablet. I got the update, wondering what would be different, and now I can only listen to 40 hours of free music on a mobile device. I can still listen on my computer but my tablet has better quality speakers. Now I don't listen to Pandora as much as I used to and that makes me upset. If I had unlimited free music like I used to I would give it 5 stars. You can pay four dollars a month to remove ads and have unlimited music but I not paying money for the subscription"
"January 20, 2013","Pandora makes listening to music such a pleasure. It isn't perfect, occasionally it will skip forward in the middle of a song I like and it can be repetitive with songs but once you start listening to it you can barely stand commercial radio. Unlike satellite radio you can set a station with any artist or song you want and a year subscription costs nearly the same as a month of satellite or you can get the free version and listen to their occasional annoying commercials. There is no talk or sports radio on Pandora but I love being able to choose the stations by songs or artists I like. You can also bookmark songs you like and buy them on iTunes which is convenient. They also tell you why they choose to play a certain artist on a station you choose although I don’t find their choices always make sense. For example I made a Coldplay station and it kept playing big band music particularly Bing Crosby. They gave some convoluted reason about percussions and rhythms but if you eant to listen to Coldplay you don't want to listen to song after song of big band music. And it would literally play song after song of big band music, I found this very strange. I resolved the issue by choosing a Coldplay song I like and making a station from that instead. Now I hear the music I’m interested in listening to from Coldplay and bands who actually have a similar style. The thumbs up/down feature rocks and so does the skip. For $36 a year you can’t beat it. Music you (mostly) love and no commercials. My husband listens to commercial radio a lot and he is constantly singing radio ad jingles without even realizing he’s doing it and it drives me nuts!"
"August 21, 2017","Have Pandora on Kindle Fire and PC, just added to cell phone to connect via Bluetooth with different vehicle. Works great."
"July 24, 2017","I just love pandora."
"August 2, 2015","Being from Europe I was disappointed, Spotify Music App. Has every music you will love, from every country. Pandora is for not for a European American, like me. I like different stations, I do listen to American Music, Pandora has also South American Music, which is not for me."
"September 30, 2012","How don't u people like this?! I love this app. plays song I luv and I think I found a great radio"
"October 11, 2017","am not technologically savvy, so I had help to add this icon to my fire tablet. it's free, so is the music"
"September 6, 2017","Cant seem to do without it. Cheaper prices here than any where else I can buy."
"November 2, 2016","I already had an account before I got it on the Kindle, but now I can't log in! Really, this needs to change."
"August 12, 2017","Great app"
"August 2, 2017","The best of them all!!"
"July 27, 2016","A few commercials. They need a replay button so you can listen to a song more than once. They claim they can't do that."
"November 24, 2016","I have a subscription to the ad-free version and like most of the new features in the upgrade, (yea for replay!!!!). One feature I wish I could opt out of is the new pulsing logo.The colors and flashing capital ""P"" literally triggers seizures. I work hard to stay away from triggers (no TV, no movies, no videos....hence the paid subscription to Pandora). Is there a way to opt out of the pulsing logo? Thanks Amber"
"September 21, 2017","Great app. Affordable and always plays nice selections from whatever I make up. Nice!"
"August 30, 2017","Stupid APP would NOT UPLOAD!! I turned off the Kindle 3x, still wouldn't work! BOOOO!!!😾😾😾😾😾"
"August 25, 2017","Ok"
"May 25, 2017","I thoroughly enjoy Pandora on a regular basis. Thank you for providing a variety of great listening music for your subscribers."
"October 12, 2017","Love it"
"March 21, 2016","Have listened to it for years- free, easy streaming that allows you to develop individual preferences. I usually like the song selections and have always been impressed by how well the songs seem to connect to one another."
"July 25, 2017","Great app!! Wish I had downloaded this months ago... We have this at my work and I love it! Why did I wait so long to get it for myself!?"
"March 17, 2013","Used to be the shizzle for the phone. Now they have so many ads streaming through that it will actually slow down and interrupt the song stream. WTF? And to boot, they're now asking you pay after 40 hrs every month. I used to play it in the car, at work, bike riding, etc. 40 hrs is a few days for me.  As far as the mobile app goes, screw Pandora with their 40 hr limit and endless ads. You have far too much competition for this crap!  Now, for the pc review. On the pc you don't experience the above issues however, there's still a lot of ads. UNLESS . . . you know a trick, like I do. And yes, it's completely legal.  For your home pc, Google ""Adam Haile Elpis"". Click on the first hit. Here, you can download Elpis which, is a free desktop client for Pandora. In other words, it is a program designed to play Pandora. Nifty thing is that it does two amazing things. 1- it allows you to have unlimited skips. 2- it will not download any ads. In other words, it simulates the pay service.  YOU'RE WELCOME!!!"
"November 19, 2016","I use it every day, especially in my car,"
"April 29, 2017","I enjoy Pandora music very much thank you"
"February 28, 2016","Great app ! I put in I wanted ""Frank Sinatra"" theme for my music. Every song that plays I say "" How do they know I like that song and artist?"". Great app, and the price is right, nothing. I do not even hear the occasional ad they throw in."
"April 3, 2013","Pandora has been with me since its inception and on a 3G connection on an iPhone it worked GREAT.  When I took the plunge into the world of Android and 4G I had a problem with Pandora not wanting to work or was very sluggish between songs. It seems they have rectified that situation and all is good now. I can drive just about anywhere and have my music playing non-stop.  A couple of things for them to think about. I would like to see the ads more geared towards the particular user that is listening to music... one that listens to 'nature' or 'classical' is a different creature than one that listens to 'rap', 'rock', 'pop', etc. Regional ads would be great too. I would love to know that my local convenience store that is just down the street is having a sale on some widget.  All in all it was a rocky start and I went back to listening to other services for a while until Pandora got their act together and got an update out that fixed their problems. Since then... smooth sailing.  Pandora ROCKS!"
"June 19, 2012","I have been using Pandora as a paid member, for years since before the 'app' came out. Now its everywhere, in my kindle, my iPhone, and even in a program form for my PC. Its my favortite App and Music Player. I have various moods for music, and by the entry of one song for the mood I'm in, it instinctivly plays other songs around that genre and style. Like sometimes I'm in the Lady Gaga mood, and then I listen to main stream dance pop for the evening. Other times I want to hear some Nickleback or Papa Roach, and then I am jamming to that and all simular songs. Another perk is it plays current new 'in' songs from that genre so I do get exposed to fresh music around my favorites selections, so its always expanding my musical horizons as well as keeping me saticfied with what ever mood I am in at the moment. I pay the anual fee for several years now, because.... who wants commercials? Why not pay them to help them operate their service, instead of letting advertizing agencies pay them and force their product in my face? I never hear commercials, which is one reason why I canceled my Satilight Radio service and switched to Pandora. ALSO it's MUCH cheaper annually than XM Radio, and can be heard on any internet device, unlike XM Radio, where only on registered devices. This is a great internet radio service :)"
"December 15, 2016","I don't see a whole lot of variety in the Trance and Techno genres meaning that as I listen for 2 hours to nearly 20 tracks, only 5 or 6 musical artists are played."
"June 20, 2017","Great music selections and so very easy to use."
"August 15, 2017","Love it"
"December 29, 2013","Here is a service that will play any song that is in their archive that you want to hear. They will even find similar songs to match to your interest. I started with Johnny Cash, and before I knew it through their recommendations I had many songs by many artists that they play randomly for me. I love it. And, they are adding more regularly. You can't beat this service and best of all it's free."
"October 23, 2016","Always playing my favorites and even introducing me to new music."
"October 12, 2014","Its a bit of a hassle to get the music you want --you can ask for it and they will eventually play it --but they play a lotofo what they want to play in between your music--and also turn themselves off ifi you dn't click and watch an add now and then--I would use Spotify if it would load on my KINDLE FURE"
"December 11, 2013","I mean, it's Pandora Radio...on your Kindle. What else do I need to say? It works just like the mobile app. Ok the one thing that comes to mind is that to close the app, you have to pretty much go to your Home Page and then hit the more options button on the top right corner and tap ""Quit"". If you tap the Home button, it continues to play in the background. No big deal, and its a little weird to me probably because I've only had the Kindle for a little over a month."
"January 18, 2013","anyone who needs free music Pandora is the one for you!!!!!!!Y'all really need to get Pandora.You can play any song no money this is awsome"
"November 9, 2016","Great music selection. Totally recommend this."
"March 10, 2014","I love the way it suggests other artists you might like and have found several that I hadn't really listened to before and really liked their music. And best of all it's free, you just have to listen to a few commercials but there aren't that many. For some reason when I listen at work it ""times me out"" but when I'm listening at home I don't get that."
"November 7, 2011","I love using pandpora and this app does the same thing. After some recent updates, they now have pop up ads that are a little intrusive but for me I use this the most when I am driving so I am not looking at the screen.  lag time in between songs is usually pretty good (not as quick as the desktop version with high speed internet connection) but overall not bad considering that I'm driving through numerous cell towers as I'm usually listening to Pandora. lag time can also be due to my Droid Pro, I have been having issues with it lately.  Nice album art when its playing (too bad it usually gets covered up with the ads) and very easy to use command buttons."
"November 22, 2015","It's so nice to have the music I want to hear without annoying DJ chatter & commercials! I downloaded this for a long drive but listen to Pandora even to & from the grocery store- best part...you pick who you want to listen to, from Abba to ZZ Top"
"February 2, 2016","The interface was obviously intended for a larger screen than the standard ""Fire"" tablet, so some of the buttons are a little too small. Otherwise it works exactly as you'd expect."
"February 8, 2014","I use Pandora because of the thumbs up down system and that the service itself is free. The app is good but it could use a little help with auto scaling and scrolling for smaller and square screens. Actually most apps today don't take this screen size limitation or scaling into account and that impacts my use of the app. Otherwise good."
"February 6, 2017","great music app"
"April 27, 2017","As expected"
"June 12, 2017","Too bad I can't give 0 stars because zero use is how much this is worth. Won't open, just says experiencing technical problems every time I try to sign in. Deleted it."
"May 23, 2017","Enjoyable listening experience!"
"November 19, 2016","Best music ever keeps my mine claim all day"
"October 29, 2016","After the update.. I can't skip songs anymore. When I watch the vids for skips they still don't come. Make this app great again by not touching features that don't need touching! And the ads are worse! I don't mind the commercials since this app is free but take away the ads! They are in the way!"
"October 17, 2017","Luv it!!!"
"April 14, 2013","Not the best app ive seen but its better hen other radio apps. The reason I'm giving it three stars instead of five is because it picks songs that are picked by other people that like your song and that's why its amazing but if you don't like the song you can either skip it or dislike it that's not bad but you have limited skips and everytime you dislike a song it skips it every hour of listening you gain some skips. And also you HAVE to have Internet to use this app."
"July 18, 2017","Can't beat it for free"
"August 4, 2017","Super app for us music buffs!"
"March 5, 2016","Maybe it is just the kindles we have? But it is a little buggy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. That said we are big Pandora fans and we use Pandora on all our devices. Just wish it worked better on the kindles"
"September 1, 2017","Love it I listened to it all day today."
"June 24, 2017","Great music station. i can listen to the music I like with limited interruptions."
"February 24, 2013","Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference."
"March 29, 2013","What can a person say about a music service that customizes one's listening taste into an intuitive music playback service? It's great and worth having, unless you're someone who likes to play the same personal collection of mp3's over and over again. Pandora allows its fans to add variety by accepting or rejecting tunes according to one's taste in music. In the end, you get a music channel personalized to YOU! How good is that!?"
"September 11, 2016","Great app for listening to music with! Just wish that there was more skips available. But, none the less great variety, and app!!"
"August 22, 2017","great ! ability to change music to match my mood when ever I want."
"June 19, 2014","I have always listened to Pandora on my PC. Now that I have downloaded the app on my phone, my lists and stations are all transferred. It's great !"
"July 12, 2017","Great!"
"July 17, 2017","Works very well in the app. Searching is easy and simple to use. Streams well on my tablet."
"June 20, 2017","Enjoy the many different types of music there is to listen to."
"November 17, 2015","I enjoy getting on Pandora. It allows me to explore different types of music and develop my own playlist. It allows me to sit back and listen to a group I might have overlooked previously so then I can go from there and experience different groups that are somewhat alike. I just don't like the ""ads interruption"
"October 12, 2017","Used to be awesome, now just like listening radio, unless you pay."
"February 29, 2016","Love Pandora forever.It even plays Kpop for me.Pandora would be my soulmate if it wasn't a music app,it got better from the last few years.I just wish ads were gone,and I didn't need to pay to skip G-Dragon's crappy music (don't kill me fellow Kpopers)"
"February 18, 2013","If I could give pandora ten stars I would.It is one of my favorite apps, if you like music this app is a must.It's worth paying the $4 to listen free of commercials.I have pandora on my phone, kindle and all my tv's at home.So I recommed to anyone who loves to hear a variety of music, sometimes you'll hear a tune that takes you back into time. So get it, you won't regret you did."
"July 14, 2017","The monthly Bill isn't bad can not pick the artist or the songs but still a good station"
"September 30, 2016","being of the ""older generation"" but absolute music lover, my daughter told me about pandora and i haven't looked back !! didn't take me long to purchase the ad-free version ($4.99 a month). it's fantastic to be able to have so many genre's at your finger tips and take it wherever you go. i really love the blue-tooth feature in car while traveling and having my music as i like it !!!!! a truly great product ......"
"February 21, 2017","When I try to play a station, it plays for one second and stops. Pressing pause and play has no effect. The menu says I'm listening to a station, but it just sits on the one-second mark."
"April 7, 2012","I AM CONSTENTLY PLAYING PANDORA. IT PLAYS TONS OF DIFFRENT TYPES OF MUSIC. I CANT THINK OF A TIME THAT I GET ON MY KINDLE FIRE AND DONT HAVE PANDORA PLAYING. EVERYONE WHOS LIFE REVOLVES AROUND MUSIC SERIOUSLY NEEDS THIS APP. TRUST ME U WILK BE GLAD U GOT IT."
"May 10, 2014","I received head phones for Mother's Day along with a suggestion for Pandora. I now live with phones on my head almost all day long. We have become so accustomed to TV, the computer and today's technology ""stuff"" .. I had almost forgotten the shear joy of LISTENING to music and actually HEARING the WORDS of the songs. With Pandora I can choose what I want to listen to .. it's truly wonderful."
"December 21, 2013","I love this app as I can listen no matter where i am. It keeps track of what i listen to and records all my thumbs up and downs and plays only music i will like to listen to (takes time but well worth it)"
"October 18, 2013","I got this so I could integrate my smart TV with my android tablet and use my tablet as a remote for the radio, and it does exactly what it is supposed to. I particularly enjoy being able to put in the artist or song and up it pops, though I get bored pretty quickly when the same type of music keeps coming. Still, it's a must have for those who enjoy 'listening' to radio!"
"July 26, 2017","Love it."
"August 1, 2017","Nice music, control your channel"
"January 4, 2014","I think the concept of Pandora is great, but I would like to have information about maneuvering through and being able to make it work for me. Where do you find instructions?"
"May 21, 2016","I can chose my own artist and listen to it in any room on different devices. Listen to it most afternoons when working around the house or just reading, prefer Pandora to TV."
"August 12, 2017","Good app"
"February 6, 2017","the bomb"
"January 8, 2013","I love Pandora!! You can build your own stations, for example 70's music and then have the opportunity to like or dislike each song. This allows Pandora to find more songs that it thinks you will like and has given me back songs from my childhood, plus new favorites. Also, it allows you to listen to comediannes and then supplies you with others with the same type of humor, which allows you to ""discover"" new comics. THANK YOU!!"
"June 14, 2016","I love Pandora. I tune in at bedtime and the music put me to sleep. I like the oldies so I tune in to an oldies station and I am good to go."
"July 29, 2017","Love the selections I can make. Sound quality is great for those moments when you just need some peaceful sounds to relax."
"March 14, 2013","I work cleaning horse stalls every day for 3 hours. I listen to several of the stations, commerical free. All station repeat the same music. I used a competor for awhile but even the fee based product dropped the wifi periodically. Pandora one - keeps me connected, with good quality. I get the signal on my IPHONE and play it on a Bose radio. In my case well worth the money"
"July 17, 2017","Love the music selection."
"October 20, 2016","Been using it for years, never been disappointed."
"August 30, 2017","I liked Pandro for a long time but Amazon Music is better."
"May 22, 2017","good"
"December 20, 2015","Love me some Pandora"
"July 24, 2017","Too many ads on Pandora now. It's almost like they inundate you with advertising so that you will pay not to have ads."
"January 10, 2014","I down loaded this music station because it was so easy and simple. They have all the songs and stations that you could evevy want to here.I like that you can even search the song that you want to listen to.I don't like that every time i want to that app on my tablet they asked me for a password.I would tell everyone of all ages it's worth your time to down load it."
"March 17, 2015","Very pleased to have the choices of music and easy access of hearing on my kindle while doing other things with the kindle or just time out by the pool. My husband and I like to dance to the music also. Convenient way to listen. Thanks to Pandora!!!!"
"December 18, 2016","Nice app"
"July 20, 2017","Works great on the HD Fire 8"
"August 30, 2015","Listen to it on the weekends, especially love the 80's rock era! Hardly any commercials to listen to, like you do on TV and the radio stations!"
"March 28, 2016","I added Pandora to my kindle when I went to the hospital for surgery. One of the nurses asked what music I had on because it was so restful. She said she loved stopping by my room. I am not a TV fan."
"January 30, 2016","Pandora is the best. Listen every day. They throw in so much music to compliment the original artist that you forget the original request most of the time. No other can bet this. I suggest anybody give this a chance."
"May 6, 2017","It's awesome! I love all the variety of all the stations! Thanks sooo much for such a great listening environment!"
"July 21, 2017","Great selections of a wide variety of quality music."
"February 12, 2016","Pros: -Very organized display of your playlists, artist info -User friendly interface"
"July 8, 2014","Now if I can just figure out how to get it on my car radio, instead of Sirius.  They had special 4th of July channels of various types. I loved the Classical one.  For everyday listening, I like the different channels in my genre. The SHUFFLE feature is excellent, so you don't get bored listening to just one album."
"December 23, 2015","If it was possible I would give this no stars. I've had to shut down my kindle at least seven times in the last hour because I dared to use this poorly designed app. My kindle screen doesn't work when I've used this app. It comes up blank but the music continues to play. I used this app with my old kindle and experienced similar problems. I thought it was the kindle, but clearly there is an issue with the app. PLEASE FIX IT. I love Pandora radio but I won't be using it until the issue is solved."
"November 12, 2015","Once you get the hang of setting up the ""stations"" it's a piece of cake, and you'll never hear a song you don't like. I love a lot of different stuff; and I like having a place where I can hear Bach and Styx in the same place."
"June 14, 2014","I find it easy to use and that is saying a lot with me. I am not a high tech kind of girl so I things simple. I just downloaded and upgraded it for no ads and it was smooth sailing from then on. I can use my phone or iPad or even my kindle and it works great. I get awesome tunes while sunning at my pool what could be better! Thanks Pandora!"
"September 16, 2015","Have listened to Pandora for several years on my computer, so decided to add it to my cell phone. It is easy to select different programming. I like that it tells the song, performer, and more information. I am a real fan."
"December 31, 2011","I keep this playing most of the time! while I cook, play games, search, or whatever! I can listen to whatever style of music that matches my mood."
"July 21, 2016","It doesn't work in Jamaica"
"October 19, 2016","been a loyal customer"
"December 14, 2016","Nice"
"October 5, 2017","So I have a iPod touch and a kindle and no data you can get a free premium trial for a month and its let's you listen to music that's like the music you listen to and if actually works."
"May 31, 2017","I love their wide variety in choices of music!"
"November 18, 2016","Didn't think I would like it, but I was wrong. I love it."
"August 30, 2017","A lot Of good music and different stations and very good reception."
"December 22, 2011","In the interest of full disclosure, I don't have a Kindle Fire. But, if I did, Pandora would be the first App I'd put on it. (I'm here investigating it for a friend.)  Pandora is the best thing to happen to music since the electric guitar was invented. I use it almost every day - at work on my PC or my iPod, at home on my TiVo HD (over my home audio system where it sounds awesome), and on the road over my Android phone. It takes a little tuning to create unique, individual stations. You have to carefully choose seed songs & artists and ""thumb up"" songs that match the station concept and ""thumb down"" songs that don't, even it you like the song. Otherwise, all of your stations start to sound alike.  Create one variety station where you ""thumb up"" everything you like and ""thumb down"" everything you don't like and Pandora will zero in on exactly what your kind of music is (and even describe it to you). That will be your favorite station (like having your own personal radio station). But also, create different stations for different moods or situations and ""prune"" them (using the web site) by removing songs from the ""thumbs up"" that don't belong there when a station starts to drift too much.  I pay the small annual fee to get no commercials. worth every penny."
"December 23, 2014","Great music application for cell phone, home system, etc. Pick performers you like and Pandora creates radio stations with similar music automatically. Very easy to use. Sound quality is excellent."
"April 30, 2017","Its a great way to listen to free music. It is great to find singers but there is evidently preferred artist because their songs play all the time."
"February 2, 2017","It works great on the Kindle Fire Without Amazon Ads except when it opens unexpectedly and plays music over whatever else I was doing instead."
"April 8, 2012","I have always loved Pandora Radio and was excited to have it for my phone. But a lot of the times it will freeze or I've also encountered issues where it doesn't fully play the song and skips to the next. AND THE BUFFERING! Forget it! I will have a perfect connection and this will still occur. The ads also freeze up the program, too, I feel. Hopefully they will come out with an update that fixes this, unless it's just an error I'm receiving with my LG Optimus S."
"February 17, 2014","I love Pandora!!! Its great and easy to use! Most music apps are confusing or take you straight to YouTube, but all the music is on Pandora. Just pick a playlist, artist or album and *POP* you jave your music! The only thing I'm don't like about Pandora is that when you pick an artist l, there's other artists on that playlist or such. Otherwise, I still love it!"
"February 4, 2016","Had no idea this site existed until a co-worker told me. This is a wonderful and amazing discovery. All my favorite songs and great sound quality any time I want it. Thank you Amazon and Pandora!!!"
"August 10, 2017","Nice app"
"August 8, 2017","Pandora is great like Sirius FM is great, but I'm sold on Spotify."
"January 28, 2015","I enjoy this app a lot with the shuffle feature and constant music. I was fine with the ads after a few songs because its a free app, BUT once the ads started interrupting and completely stopping the music all together is when i decided to use another app. It also likes to stop for no reason when i lock the screen after a song."
"August 30, 2017","I love Pandora. I like all kinds of music and I can program what I want to listen to . I wish I had gotten this a long time ago."
"March 13, 2013","a good product and good background music for work and play, able to select the type and kind of music you want to listen to instead of letting the radio station or DJ of that station to choose for you, more control of the music you want to hear and when you want to hear, to fit your mood at times. Unfortunately, the subscriptions can be costly if your taste is broad and wants it more than one genre, or one type of music station."
"November 16, 2016","I love listening to Pandora"
"July 13, 2017","Love listening to the genre of my choice, easy and convenient to use."
"August 23, 2013","I like the Seekers, The Carpenters, Keali'i Reichel, Asuca Hayashi, Marty Robbins... and a whole bunch of other artists that are no longer (if they ever were) mainstream. Very hard to find a radio station that plays ""my"" music. This app logs into your Pandora account and plays your music for you. No issues, just pure functionality. What's not to like?"
"September 15, 2014","This is another app that was purchased by one of my daughters. And therefore, she has said that this is an excellent app to have installed on either a phone, tablet, or something else. In actuality, all 3 of my daughters enjoy this app and are thrilled to be able to have access to something enjoyable like this everyday."
"February 23, 2015","YEAH!!!!!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I love music all kinds every kind of music. The great thing about having it on P. is I can do my Chair Arobics with the music I love at the same time"
"June 8, 2013","This app is so fun! It requires internet so you can't really play it anywhere, but that's the only really I can find. It helped me find new songs that I've never heard before and surprisingly I like those songs. The music range is so wide that you can pick basically any type of music, even instrumental and foreign. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't installed this yet. You won't be disappointed!"
"November 7, 2016","Great listening music"
"October 13, 2016","Great place for music"
"April 19, 2014","Pandora has a good service and exposes me to artists that I might not normally find. I like the ability to rate music I'm listening to, with thumbs down going away, forever. I wish there were a way to change that, though, and if there is I've not found it. The ads are obnoxious, though - not only do you have to listen to them but they pop up in app and are very easy to inadvertently trigger. Really guys? Can't just pick one way for ad delivery? Also kind've lame considering you, Pandora, do not pay a lot of the artists for the media usage rights, but we'll just see how the court case pans out on that one. I hope you get it figured out and survive because I really enjoy the service you provide."
"September 5, 2012","it used to work nicely on my G-Tab (honeycomb), but since this last update I only get a blue screen. hopefully this will get resolved soon? I am at a loss for how to rate this because before it was just fine. I will give it a one star until it gets working again. Update 11/29/2012: I restarted my tablet a couple of times and now it works just fine (again). Therefore, I am back to the 4 stars that this great APP deserves."
"April 2, 2014","As stated above ""The best thing since sliced butter spreads"" But seriously, I do like when they select a similar artist or song from what you have picked because you may discover a new talent that you may really enjoy....Peace and love !!!"
"February 20, 2016","I love pandora as I can have more options to play which music I want. Just wish I don't have a limit to fast forward if I want to fast forward a song. Otherwise I'm happy with it!"
"December 5, 2016","Of course I use Pandora everyday. It give such a great variety of music, music that is not played on my local radio station. I love it."
"June 13, 2013","I have this app on my phone and home PC but I have never seen the permission to send email to guest without your permission before till I started to install it here on my tablet. just as I was about to click to install there it was among all the other premissions. I canceled the install and went back to the Amazon app store description for Pandora and it isnt listed there yet. Must be a new permission. IM not installing it here."
"August 22, 2017","Appreciate the opportunity to select any type of music I like."
"August 11, 2017","I have used this on Sony smart TV and now I have it on my Fire"
"March 5, 2016","Doesn't work on Kindle fire at all. 😕 Need an activation code for Kindle fire.....can't find one. Useless without it .HELP"
"July 18, 2017","I enjoy listen and it picks songs based on my likes spot on!"
"September 5, 2017","Pandora is awesome!!! Don't know how I'd live without it!!!!"
"June 19, 2017","It's where all the music is at. The app work great. Thank you."
"December 22, 2015","I recomend this app for and to everyone.You keep your track right on this and it doesn't take much space up at all! it has old songs, new songs, and much much more :) please get this app.... you'll enjoy it"
"February 26, 2017","Pandora knows the music I love, and I don't have to do a thing but tune in and be entertained!"
"November 8, 2016","Awesome music !!!"
"August 31, 2013","I was very happy when I discovered the Pandora app for my new Kindle Fire. However I came to realize. It only works when it what's to. It works great for one day, and if you try to use it the next day. It freezes on you. So disappointing!"
"August 13, 2017","best out there"
"August 27, 2017","Great site, works really really good with the Kindle tablet."
"July 18, 2017","Good music station"
"August 25, 2017","I loved it"
"March 5, 2017","love this app because it has almost every song that you can think of like it's been so long if you are a Fnaf lover or song's that you might like"
"December 22, 2015","Always a goog balance in any genre."
"August 6, 2017","I love Pandora. I can't live without it. I've made many great stations but mostly listen to my Tool station."
"March 14, 2017","It is awesome I do my stretches to it and listening to my favorite music makes it easier 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍"
"November 9, 2016","Love this app. Use it all the time."
"May 11, 2015","Good back ground music, easy to program. I run it through my smart TV and into my AMP. I've had it shut down at times but I change the block of music and it works fine."
"June 3, 2012","Sometimes I'm in the mood for World, or George Winston-type New Age piano, or broader New Age stuff. So those are my current formats on Pandora! ""Followers"" can listen in, too. (I don't mean Facebook; Pandora has their own system.) Pandora's computers play stuff for you based on your initial stated preference of artist or song each time you're in the mood for something you haven't been listening to on Pandora yet. And you are able to vote each song up or down, or to skip the current piece. It's basically an interactive music collection, vastly larger than the records or tapes or discs you could or would store at home. OTOH it doesn't make you assemble and buy song by song like for your own iPod® either. They've scientifically analyzed recorded music based on elements like tempo, culture, mood, rhythm, instrumentation, even key, time signature, etc., and base their choices for you on the characteristics contained in your first choice, as well as on your subsequent votes. (They really want your votes too. If you go too long without voting, they'll stop and post a notice making sure you're still listening, and remind you they can't afford ""playing to an empty room""!)  The free service includes audio and even video commercials, even ones local to your market. I don't usually mind, in fact, as an old radio hand, I like how ""stop-sets"" break it up a little, especially in the absence of DJs or news. Some ads are targeted for your gender, too. But I heard a political ad recently, which I felt violated the mood. Also, sometimes songs or ads get cut off. And they do warn you this can chew up alot of your monthly MBs or GBs. You can pay to stop the ads and improve sound quality even more than what I find perfectly adequate for my laptop or tablet speakers, currently $36US/year IIRC, and I might do that, as this US election year promises/threatens to carpet-bomb us with ads of the worst kind yet.  If your screen is big enough they also send, with each song as it's playing, album art, artist information if available, and the scientific reasons why they think this song fits your format (though I'm not sure ""headnodic"" is a word!!). So I've learned a lot about music I've always wondered about... without the financial pain of buying discs or songs blindly.  One thing you can't do is request *by* format or scientific characteristic. I'm part Native American, but city-raised, so I just typed that into the box; but if you don't know an artist or song title, the system can't help you.  You can also get the service through [...], without this app, but I don't know how that would work out on a smaller device.  Long story short, this may be the future of music radio -- ""narrowcasting,"" even self-help."
"November 20, 2016","Love it"
"August 11, 2017","I love that you can choose pretty much whatever type of music to listen to."
"June 23, 2017","So much better than the radio!!!!"
"July 20, 2017","Favorite app for music great selection. Always recommend."
"September 2, 2017","Love it!"
"February 11, 2014","Pandora has delivered great music that I love with limited commercials> the Jazz stations are awesome this is great and I listen every nite to jazz"
"May 12, 2014","I have been thumbing up and down songs for five years now. Once you have spent time culling through the collection, it becomes a wonderful radio station that plays 90% of just what you like. Until you have put in that amount of time, it will play totally random stuff that has nothing to do with the song seeds you started with."
"July 18, 2017","It's just great. Perfect music selections. Easy to use."
"May 14, 2016","Pandora enables me to stream a huge variety of music genres on my Bose system at home and on the go on my mobile devices. I enjoy all types of music but Christian is my favorite. There are endless choices within that genre, something for every mood and taste."
"July 16, 2014","I even subscribed to the Pandora one over Sirius. $4.99 for Pandora, over $15.00 for Sirius per month. I don't like Howard Stern that much. I like to be able to skip a song if I don't like it, but do not like that this option is limited per day. Got it because my motorcycle radio's reception sucks. Crystal clear and integrates with my motorcycle radio from my iphone through a simple FM transmitter."
"June 26, 2016","Who doesn't love Pandora put! RIGHT!!!"
"June 23, 2017","Have not been able to connect with Pandora. site will not accept my information.Got tired of trying."
"August 15, 2017","Songs are erratic. Stop ,start, stop, start then ""playback error"". Would pay for a subscription if not for that. The music selections are great but the stop, start is annoying."
"April 18, 2016","Not as good as iheartradio but still good. Too many adds."
"November 9, 2016","Very good"
"August 14, 2017","linked to my Alexa and it's great!"
"February 6, 2017","Love, love, love you! Awesome! Keep getting better!"
"January 17, 2013","Like this app. Extra stuff that the so-called smart TV app doesn't have , like artist info . Good online radio ."
"November 17, 2016","Love it."
"November 18, 2016","Great"
"January 9, 2014","VERY nice! I am very pleased with how Pandora looks and performs on Kindle Fire. The only issue is that about half the time when I turn it on, it quickly shuts back off and I have to restart it (then it stays on), but I don't find that too be a huge issue. It is more pleasing to use and look at on my Kindle than it is on my PC. I really like it."
"December 20, 2016","My original music player, love this app!! Especially when I want a mix and don't feel like handpicking each and every song"
"May 1, 2017","App is all good. Even better than iphone. I dont get adds on while playing on fire."
"August 7, 2017","Really digging it. No djs yacking after every song. Thanks Pandora!"
"July 24, 2017","Awesome app great music that you want to listen to."
"August 11, 2017","Love it !!! My kind of music whenever I want it."
"September 18, 2017","Very good"
"July 18, 2017","great music and great listening lots of variety I love this app."
"November 5, 2015","Pay the extra for no ads! Support a great service! Have commercial free music of any genre you can think of, and can change it as often as you want. OMG I LOVE this ! It's ok on your phone, but hook it up to a good home stereo....WOW!"
"February 22, 2014","Pandora is my standby go-to app for online streaming. I love being able to read about the artists, and the 'similar artists' while listening. Your stations become more personalized with time as you click the Like / Dislike buttons. Its not the only game in town and it doesn't do offline saving/listening, but what it does, it does good."
"July 18, 2017","Unclear why I had to download dish music app to use it."
"December 5, 2013","Pandora is an App everybody should have. It's better than any other music App. It is free and you can listen to particular songs, genre, or albums that you love. We were looking for a real radio station with holiday music, when I thought, wait a minute, let's listen on Pandora. My sister had me install Pandora on her phone right then. It is great!"
"July 31, 2015","I love Pandora radio there's plenty varietys of music to fit everyones needs. I have one of the Bluetooth lightbulbs and I always have mine hooked up to the Pandora radio. It's the only music app I use."
"July 26, 2015","Perfect fit for my new Fire D6 tablet. When I exercise and walk the treadmill each morning I get a continuous supply of great music. I really like being able to select the type music I would like. For an hour each morning I get uninterrupted classic rock - Pink Floyd, Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc. Without the music I am not sure I could complete the arduous exercise, but Pandora makes it a pleasure. One just cannot beat it for the price."
"December 29, 2012","If you're trying to go back and discover the last track you listened to instead of swiping back you have to turn the kindle on its side and push the arrow button...not intuitive, not easily discovered unless you do it on accident.  Why is the app do boring and blocky looking? The iOS Pandora app is far more attractive, why not give the kindle the same sort of sleek offerings instead of something that looks like an afterthought?  The kindle fire he app store has been so disappointing in general."
"May 2, 2014","Whatever you want to hear, Pandora has it and will play it for you for free. You choose your stations, you create as many stations as you want and it all waits for your next listening session or mood or activity. With thumb up and thumb down option, you can eventually have a huge playlist of favorites only. Pandora is great."
"November 29, 2014","Pandora is amazing but sometimes the person your interested in, in music of course the he/she s music wanders off somewhere else. Say for instance you wanna hear Taylor Swift after a while it goes to lets say the band Maroon 5. BUT I would suggest it. It's free anyway."
"December 30, 2015","The GREATEST music app. available. Great selection of stations. Very few commercials."
"July 17, 2016","I love listening to the variety of old and new songs with very few commercials. What's especially great about Pandora is that I can choose the kind of music I like!"
"August 9, 2014","I love Pandora! Its my own personalized radio. it plays every song you can think of. so you make your own radio by typing in an artist/song and it creates it, then it also plays other similar artists. and you can add as many different artists on one radio you want, or you can make as many individual radios as you want also."
"December 26, 2014","In spite of any ads for Pandora, song selections are limited. Stations must be ""tuned in."" To get a station to lat the music you want it is necessary to pay attention to what you are playing, reject songs not of that artist or genre, and accept songs that are appropriate."
"April 28, 2014","As I downloaded for my 20 year old so I cannot truly give proper feedback. However, I will tell you that she continues to use it after many, many months. She sets it up on a Bluetooth speaker and seems to like it so I will give it 5 stars. If she had problems, it would have definitely been deleted! Hope this somewhat helps."
"May 25, 2017","Easy listening"
"April 13, 2014","I have been using Pandora for many years. I have created many of my own stations and added a lot of preset type stations from them. If you don't like what is on one station you will almost certainly find something on another. I use the free version but if you do listen a lot like my daughter, you might like the yearly or monthly subscription."
"February 2, 2016","Pandora is how I listen to most of my music. It has a huge verity of music and artists. It does a good job of guessing what other music I like and gives me 100 different artists or playlists at a time in my library to chose from. Plus it still gives me the option to skip or dismiss a song if I don't like it."
"August 30, 2017","Love, love, love pandora. I can never get enough of every kind of music I love. In the house on a walk and while I am mowing the lawn. It's always easy to get."
"June 5, 2017","Very good product i use it often."
"July 30, 2015","Large, intrusive display ads that got annoying but its song library is massive, and its programming works wonderfully. Extremely easy to use, but it's also very good at getting to know your musical taste. The ads are why I only gave 4 stars."
"September 2, 2017","Disappointed with Pandora's sound quality though the app works OK."
"January 6, 2017","Have it on my favorite channel all the time Nice Christmas 2016 thanks."
"April 5, 2014","I liked the idea that I could listen to my music virtually commercial free...the ones I did hear weren't yelling at me like the radio stations do. The only drawback that I found was that after a few songs, it stopped playing. When I tried to reload it, it wouldn't so I went back to my saved music I have on my micro SD card."
"November 11, 2016","ok"
"December 3, 2016","I'm really enjoy the music stations I can conjure up on Pandora. Hearing music I have never heard before is wonderful."
"July 25, 2017","Awesome!"
"July 2, 2016","Pandora would not accept me as a customer!"
"November 10, 2017","Love Pandora . We can listen to whatever we want whenever we want ! ❤️❤️❤️"
"January 30, 2014","It's free! I don't mind the commercials, as long as it remains free! Having my favorite artists so available is awesome. Very easy to use, too."
"March 17, 2014","As long as you have access to the Internet, you will have access to Pandora.com, which has a large database of available tunes. You can decide which genre you want and adjust it to play only what you want to hear. It will, however, make suggestions based upon your preferences. It's almost like owning your own radio station."
"December 29, 2012","How can you not love Pandora? It is so easy to use and it seems to play what you want to hear when you need to hear it. I have pandora on my computer, iPhone, TV and at work. Sometimes I want to hear a mix of my saved stations and other times, I just want to hear one. Pandora makes all this easy! Now, there are ads and I need to click on ""Still Listening"" every so often, but its free and I am ok with that."
"December 31, 2014","I used to love Pandora, until they decided to leave Mexico out of their service area. Now we get Spotify and Google Play and Grooveshark which, while not as good, at least they work over here.  Which brings me to my main question: Why are you offering this app to me if I can't use it?"
"October 29, 2015","Pandora is a great service. The varied number of songs available in any genre that you can name is mind boggling. I could never afford to buy all that music, but yet I can listen to it at any tine. Great stuff!"
"May 23, 2013","I'm a DJ/VJ. Subscriber to White-Label, Virtual DJ Premium, ASCAP, and was a subscriber to 3 other labels.  The industry should and is going down in CD sales with Pandora, Slacker, MusicTube, etc. and alternativesto.net but it's the era of making money in other ways like product placement and adds.  There is really no point to buying what we use to buy with advertisements on Pandora, etc. and Office Starter for example. And the industry is going that way, BTW.  Pandora is worth it. $36 for 1 year. Free if you want to take more advertisements. XM I can get 6 months for $25.  Everything is going open source. And the advertisements are getting heavy.  For all relating to Open Source/ie free/ the best website to figure this out is alternativesto.net"
"April 13, 2015","Whether on smart TV menus, bluray players or ROKU/Amazon Fire TV (or even cell phones/tablets, where I have it but don't use it) it works well-and I have found some artists I didn't know about on various ""similar"" channels that I have set up."
"June 23, 2017","Your awesome!  You are awesome"
"January 23, 2014","It is very nice to be able to look up songs and/or musicians. I have found music I thought I had forgotten. It is relaxing and uplifting to here such high quality music. Thank you !"
"December 10, 2016","I am enjoying Pandora's music very much! I like the variety and opportunity to create my own category or genre."
"November 30, 2016","when did they only allow one person to listen at a time?? used to like to have me and the wife in separate rooms listing"
"April 28, 2016","its good I love it its free and I don't care if there are ads its something I'm used to..... I love the music and they just know me taste so well....."
"May 27, 2016","Good. Easier to use than Spotify."
"June 16, 2012","This app lets you enjoy the Pandora music stations that you've come to love on your desktop or laptop computer on your mobile device. Once it's downloaded and installed on your device you can sign in and enjoy all the stations that you've created on your computer or make some new ones from your mobile phone. Any stations you create or songs that you rate on the mobile will be integrated with your computer stations so you don't have to miss a step. Next time you log on to your computer it will be right there. Or vice versa. Your ratings will also be accessible on both of your devices or any devices where you install Pandora.  Yeah, there are a few ads, just like on the web. But they're short compared to commercial radio. And you can always upgrade ($36 per year at this time) and you won't hear any ads at all. The music will be higher quality (192K bits per second) and you can listen for 5 hours at a time without ever touching your device."
"September 22, 2014","When I had an account with Pandora, I was listening to it 24/7 the apps ability to program what you wanted to listen to made all the difference in the world..I would recommend this app to everyone."
"May 25, 2017","Pandora is great, except why do we still have to deal with: Are you there? Hate playing to an empty room..."
"November 23, 2015","Great selection of music along with my favorites. Now I can't live without my Pandora!"
"August 30, 2017","I love my Pandora except when it stops to ask me if I'm still listening!"
"May 30, 2017","There are too many commercials but the music is good."
"August 7, 2017","Don't really mind the advertising on Pandora; it's the pauses and breaks that interrupt the service that is irritating."
"August 25, 2017","Good site for background music"
"June 30, 2014","I was in the move to just listen to music without much talking, so I tuned into Pandora and this setup really worked for me. I love listening to this station that allows me to pick what I want to hear, along with this station adding music they think I want to hear, which the songs they picked are great choices. I would highly recommend other turn in too."
"August 15, 2017","Even with the ads this is an awesome software product."
"October 22, 2017","Pandora works so nicely on my Kindle HD8."
"September 5, 2015","Love it but unless you purchase a subscription you will get commercials & there are restrictions on use"
"June 26, 2017","Could be better"
"September 4, 2017","love the selection"
"August 19, 2017","Just what I need for my walks."
"July 15, 2017","I love Pandora, but I like Tidal better."
"August 16, 2016","great app"
"January 8, 2016","Easy to use"
"August 18, 2014","I've always loved Pandora since day one! It's downloaded on all of my devices and I love to listen to when I sleep. I just don't like after every 2 or 3 songs there's 1 or 2 advertisements. I was paying for Pandora One so I wouldn't have ads but it just got ridiculous but I still love Pandora."
"August 24, 2017","""Are you still listening?"" Give me a break. To many of the same songs repeat way to often."
"October 26, 2016","Love it!"
"June 8, 2015","Like any good thing you would like it all to be ad free. But you can't have everything. Even the small amount of ad's with free pandora is not to bad. The site also offers you a great collection of music with any genre you can think of."
"September 23, 2017","and the cool part is that when you get a soundtrack,it plays some of the music, but it plays music like it and that's what makes it fun."
"August 6, 2017","Love Pandora app especially on shuffle mode"
"May 12, 2017","Easy to work with"
"February 24, 2015","I love the Pandora app, it performs wonderfully on my kindle fire hd. I would love it even more if you could give songs a thumbs up/down when you swipe down from the top. I tend to listen to Pandora while browsing the web or playing games on my kindle so it makes it hard to go back and forth; it would be so much more efficient with that feature."
"May 18, 2012","This review is for those who are not yet familiar with Pandora. Once you create an account, it is like running your own radio station. You create your own channels by typing in an artist's name, such as ""Beatles"". You now have a channel that plays ramdom Beatles songs mixed in with songs from similar artists like The Rolling Stones and The Who. The basic application has no fees, and in my experience only throws in a 20-30 second commercial after every 15 to 20 songs. Pretty darn good for free! I don't know if there is a limit to the number of channels you can create, but I have at least 30 of them. One of the best benefits of Pandora is being 'turned onto' artists that you didn't know about, that are similar to some of your favorites. All your channels are saved online and connected to your account, so they can be accessed on all your devices (computer, tablet, net box, smart phone, etc.) without having to recreate them. If you're a music lover, this is the BEST free service on the internet."
"January 18, 2013","I like it very much since I don't have a stereo right at the moment. I turn it on, on my phone and it sounds pretty good! Cleaned the house for 3 hours and had a good time jamming with Pandora !"
"July 8, 2014","I USED THIS AP ON THE FOURTH OF JULY HOLYDAY. IT STARTED OUT OKAY THEN IT GOT A LITTLE SLOW. COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE HOLYDAY BUT I WASN'T SURE. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY AND PERHAPS MY RATING WILL CHANGE. I HAVE IT ON MY IPHONE AND IT WORKS VERY WELL. WHEN I SAW IT WAS FREE ON MY KINDLE, I COULDN'T PASS IT UP."
"December 25, 2016","The streaming quality is just ok. Limited amount of skips to next song. Too many commercials. There are many much better alternatives such as Spotify and iHeart."
"December 9, 2016","After creating numerous artist stations I love killing time with playing my Pandora. The fact it's absolutely free it Can't be beat. A must have, your party on the go where ever."
"December 10, 2014","Just wish there were fewer ads as in the past when I had Pandora years ago. Seems like I spend a lot of time now trying to avoid them or tuning out. Will not pay that much to be AD FREE. Sorry, will use CD's or something else instead before I pay for ad free service."
"September 27, 2017","Love it could not do without it."
"February 24, 2013","MIX IT UP! I have yet to turn this off, it plays in my shack 28 hours a day, and only those horrible hours at work (and not even all of those) keep me away from pandora internet radio. Some of the songs that pop up are things I never would have owned, and I have tet to be disappointed. Pandora is what radio and cable USED TO BE! I don't know how they do it, but they need to keep doing it! (all night long)"
"February 24, 2014","Love that I can choose my artists and select different venues of music separately or mix them together as I choose Love that I can hear current songs or oldies Love that I can download it to my computer, my phone, my surface, literally anywhere. Dislike that I cannot always skip songs I don't like (only so many an hour), but I listen to this at work so this is a minor inconvenience overall great site I would recommend to anyone"
"December 28, 2012","Pandora is a great media outlet when I want to listen to a variety of music while working online or studying for my classes. It gives me an outlet of all types of music from Classical to Modern Country, Old Rock and Pop that I have listened to all my life. Type in an artist's name and a radio station will pop up with this artist's songs with an addition of songs similar to the type of music presented. Love it Love it..."
"December 27, 2016","I enjoy my music stations that play my favorite songs on Pandora and will someday get monthly subscription."
"December 26, 2016","Use it all the time. Room for improvement for sure but there is nothing like it that you can have for free."
"April 26, 2017","Love the app. Play it for my grandson's nap time."
"May 15, 2017","Use this everyday"
"December 30, 2015","I 💗 this app soon much I use it 24/7 I play music on it when I'm doing homework, work, and to put me to sleep. And if your not getting this app because of the adds you don't even notice them their quick. And it's FREE. 😆😉😘😍"
"April 15, 2015","I love Pandora and wish I had it on my car radio its so neat to chose your songs and the artist you love to hear. I spend alot of time changing channels on regular radio but thanks to Pandora I love listening on my phone, tablet and computer."
"February 7, 2014","With all the new music apps, Pandora is still my favorite. I love that I can pick my favorite artists for channels and Pandora never lets me down. I still use the free version being the ads aren't too frequent or too long. And Pandora always plays good music according to what you chose for your channels so you don't have to skip often."
"September 22, 2017","Enjoying all the artist I have put in to this point. Sound and selections are great."
"October 31, 2017","great product, smooth transaction"
"August 11, 2017","Great station, many music choices"
"January 1, 2017","I used to love Pandora and could listen on my Kindle Fire (5th generation). Suddenly, I cannot open the app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled a couple of times and disabled battery saving functions but only get the message: ""Waiting for connection. Try again?"" I can listen on my phone but not the Kindle. So frustrated!!!"
"August 15, 2017","Love the music and stations"
"July 27, 2017","I go walking at the ""Y"" about 4 times a week, and the music makes it so enjoyable!"
"December 12, 2012","i really enjoy pandora radio....i listen to it alot when i am out in the garage workin on my bike.............free is free including comercials....thats what pays for free, .....without paying for full service........i dont mind the comercials......everything is just silence filler anyway.....it is not my normal listening pleasure......just handy.....when im on the road i can choose my own special collection of cd's to listen to. thanx for free"
"July 31, 2017","Enjoy listening to a great variety of music with Pandora. It also helps me find new artists in the genres I like."
"October 8, 2017","Wonderful to find the easy to use Pandora app for Kindle! We listen to our Pandora station daily!"
"August 27, 2017","You have to pay for it."
"July 9, 2017","I love Pandora. I listen to it all the time. I love being able to add a thumbs up for a song if I like it, but I can remove it later if I get tired of hearing it. I also enjoy that there are several reggae, dancehall, and soca stations that play recent music."
"October 14, 2014","I was very disappointed at all the advertisements that came with the Pandora music app. And to be asked to pay $4.99 per month to keep the advertisements off? I don't think so. I really do like my I Heart Radio. I guess I should have just stuck with that. But, I gave it a try."
"September 8, 2014","I liked it alot, but starting to be repetitious to a point of looping that I know what will play next.  Also a suggestion, in the words of song , below the song writer (s ) are listed, the year of that song's creation would be perfect, and more complete , pleez work on that.!!"
"October 7, 2015","Love this streaming app! The algorithm lets you hear new music to expand and exlore different tastes and genres. Excellent interface and smooth transition between different platforms. Great app for music!"
"March 24, 2017","Its does not let me go in but still my brother has it and its good"
"August 5, 2017","It's perfectt"
"April 7, 2015","Pandora is a great app for those of us that do not have all the gadgets to download music to. I just loaded it on my phone and absolutely love it. I will be putting it on my tablet next. I just put an artist or a or a genre of music and Pandora will play that type of music for me. This app is a must have plus it is free :)"
"November 1, 2017","When I'm working I put on Pandora and my favorite music which is the Michael McDonald radio station and it plays for 5 to 6 hours with my favorite songs"
"May 23, 2017","Takes me where I need to go every time... musically speaking."
"December 29, 2014","I have been using Pandora for free for 3 years and I love it. My only complaint is that lately the advertisements are becoming more frequent and if you have a station set for a long time, songs start to repeat alot. To fix that just delete the station and make a new one."
"December 10, 2015","The good: great selection of songs.. The not-so-good: algorithms that don't quite get it. And how many songs you can skip per hour...get the free version first!"
"November 2, 2015","I hate this STUPID app because I am trying to put In MY EMAIL AND IT IS NOT SAYING THAT I CAN STINKING LOG ME IN RIGHT NOW😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 READER BEWARE DO NOT BYE THIS APP!!!! No seriously DON'T BYE THIS APP YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED (Very)"
"January 14, 2014","I love this app! Now I can listen to music anywhere I go! You can comment on songs, look up the lyrics(without going on the internet), and best of all create your on stations. The only thing that keeps me from rating it 5 stars is that it has too many adds. I realise you can upgrade to Pandora one but it is expensive. I would recommend this app but if you despise adds this is not the right app for you."
"August 23, 2017","It said I can not use Pandora at this time. It did not say why."
"November 13, 2015","So happy to have Pandora on my KindleFire! I was afraid I would have to download a new music program, and new music. But Pandora already has my list of favorite music, so I'm just tickled pink!"
"July 8, 2017","I like to carry this music around"
"December 22, 2013","I'd like to encourage everyone to listen and download this program. It is a great listening program for everyone. I enjoyed choosing the kind of music I enjoy most."
"September 15, 2015","Gabe me commercials in another language based on my zip code instead of my language choice. I found it highly stereotypical. And borderline offensive. I pick English as my language but because I live in a certain zip code in Los Angeles County it has all spanish commercials."
"November 16, 2015","Pandora makes Gracenote look like Chump Change, Full Spectrum, Broad Beam and the Music isn't so bad either, With 360 of pulse pounding music, it is sure to even wake up a MUMMY or TWO, so with a 1 being the lowest and a 10 being the highest remark, I grade Pandora, a 999 ZILLION PERCENT excellence award, SO A BIG THANKS TO ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS AT PANDORA, Sincerely, John Adam Rendo'n <<<((({{{ J A R }}})))>>>"
"January 8, 2017","Pandora is great for listening to music but OCCASIONALLY it can be like the radio playing the same song you've ""thumbs up"" over and over again."
"March 24, 2016","I wish I could listen to all the songs from a certain singer , group etc not only some over and over . Otherwise I put it on shuffle and listen to the station the whole day . Thanks"
"October 12, 2017","Love it!"
"April 1, 2012","Contrary to what some of the spotlight reviews have mentioned, I've nothing but good experiences with this Pandora android app.  Connection has been good with my T-Mobile 4G network. It usually buffers for 10 seconds and the song fully plays. I've experienced no hiccups with this app. It may depend on your network, location, and signal strength  The interface is very user-friendly. There is a full size image for the song/artists and then the familiar bottom bar -thumbs up, thumbs down, pause, stations, and next. On the top right corner, there is an ""i,"" which lets you read a short description on the artist and the option to look at the lyrics.  For the most part, the music is of good quality. Playing the pandora music through my headphones and car speakers, highs and lows are still distinct. It's not the best, but definitely passes for radio quality.  Still a solid option for music streaming."
"March 24, 2017","Love music"
"October 29, 2015","We like that we can make the channels our own by rating them. We use it on the TV, PC and Amazon Echo. Thumbs up that you like it or thumbs down and it never plays it again. We think it's great!"
"November 17, 2016","5 Stars nuff said.."
"July 25, 2017","Use it everyday!"
"June 1, 2016","Awesome simple apps, such a great fun!"
"November 15, 2011","music lovers will love this. personalized radio. works really nicely on the kindle too. can access stations you make on other devices too...like your web browser or phone"
"July 5, 2017","Great app!🎶"
"November 10, 2016","Great"
"September 20, 2016","We have used Pandora for a few years and I recently added it to my cell phone for use in the car. In my opinion, it is absolutely wonderful. The ability to have the kind of music we both enjoy is what our leisure listening time is about. The commercials are very few and if it should become an issue with us, we will opt for the non-commercial version"
"November 17, 2011","This is one of the most used apps on my Android phone and tablet, providing streaming music to my device. The app allows you to make channels based on your music preferences, but not necessarily letting pick individual songs. This is a free app so there are ads showing up on the screen, but they are not too intrusive.  This works well for me where there is good Wi-Fi or 3G service.  Recommended!  CFH"
"July 31, 2017","I love being able to pick my own music. Pandora is the best 😊😊😊"
"September 16, 2017","I love this app. How I can replay songs and let the app know what songs I do and do not like. So easy to look up stations."
"September 4, 2017","Regardless of the artist or bands, the variety is superior to turning on the radio."
"December 27, 2013","At the touch of one's fingers, you have your own personal music station for your favorite genre of music. You can save the songs you've listened to, and even purchase them right off of Amazon's music hub. So awesome. This is a must for music lovers."
"October 4, 2014","I enjoy peaceful music as a trigger for sleep so I entered Jim brick man which gives me a channel of piano music. I especially like the sleep timer I can set for an hour of music"
"June 16, 2015","You have to love Pandora. I know they push the commercial free product, but it's free music with playlists you can customize. Nothing to complain about here. They also seem to be doing a better job at narrowing down you're likes."
"October 29, 2016","Easy to use with a wonderful catalog of music."
"January 16, 2013","LOVE MUSIC AND COMEDY WHERE ELSE CAN YA GO TO HEAR IT ALL WONDERFUL IT'S AMAZING AND MY PEEPS LIKE IT TOO!!!"
"August 26, 2017","Great listening music."
"August 3, 2016","I love having my Pandora app on all my devices. It's so easy to use and helpful when you don't have any other way to enjoy music."
"October 7, 2016","Great music from bands I remember from 60's 70' and 80's Of which many albums I have lost in many moves over the years"
"August 14, 2017","I still get to listen to ADS!!! How do I get rid of them---while I'm PAYING FOR THIS SERVICE?"
"August 22, 2017","Excellent variety of music to select from - old & new"
"January 3, 2017","Pandora has been a great source of music for me. It is very user friendly and offers a great variety of music at no cost."
"April 5, 2017","got it working took a year"
"August 13, 2017","Outstanding, not to many commercials, and free."
"June 26, 2017","Love it!!! Plays the music I want to hear without all the talk."
"April 9, 2017","I love Pandora. Easy to use, rarely buffers. bUT YA KNOW IN ONE OF THE PICTUES AT THE TOP IT HAS TØP UM YeSsS StAy StReEt cLiQuE |-/"
"October 28, 2017","Love this app, works well on the Amazon platform."
"April 9, 2013","Pandora plays a wide variety of what I enjoy listening to the most, plus songs and bands I have never heard before based off the genre it selects from I listen to are very enjoyable. I am not a paid subscriber since depending on the device I am listening on has little very little to no commercial interruption. Like to see Pandora offer music videos as well, with and without a subscription."
"December 22, 2013","I like the app of Pandora but lately they are giving a lot more commercial and sometimes when I am listening to their music start getting interruptions as lagging and is not my Wi-Fi, since I only have the problem with them but for a free app and music is good."
"November 13, 2015","I completely understand where the name comes from as I download so much music from hearing it on the App. It is Pandora's box and the elusive Rabbit hole combined. My wife and I both love it."
"July 3, 2013","This is a great app, but i took the one star away because of the ads. They always get in the way, and as soon as I touch the screen, bam there's another one that covers the whole page. It gets annoying, and you have to pay like 3.99 a month just for no ads. Ridiculous. So yeah this app is better on a tablet or a phone with a huge screen so it doesn't cover the whole screen...but otherwise it's awesome. Doesn't really lag unless it's having a bad day...Galaxy Express i437"
"January 16, 2012","Overall a nice way to play Pandora radio on your mobile device while doing other things like reading or browsing the web. This review is more for people that know and enjoy Pandora radio for the web already. If you already don't like Pandora for whatever reason, you're not going to like the app, obviously.  Previously gave it 3 stars for lack of certain features like the ability to edit the Shuffle. Used to be a bummer to have to log into Pandora web just to change the ""QuickMix"" station list, especially considering that my preferred device for Pandora, my Kindle Fire, would just redirect to the app when I would try to use pandora.com on the silk browser. Recent updates have added this missing functionality and more nice features--which seemed to have made it hang up once in a while, but that got fixed too-- and the Pandora app is now everything I wanted from it, so it has earned two more stars! Way to go, it is about time!"
"June 10, 2016","I am a pandora subscriber since 2010 ..oh free app I guess for the phone.. haha have yet to use.. through the puter I use daily.. in fact right now.."
"July 28, 2017","Great music at no cost."
"January 20, 2012","if you had trouble changing the station(on the Kiele fire) then try go down below to where the home botton is and hit the botton in the middle with lines or the one that looks like a list and it will give you options. just play around with it and you will find it, or if you just change to the station just hit the back botton.   now yes there are advertisements that play after 3-4 songs but the only way Pandora will be free is if they do those advertisements. they only last about 30 seconds.  i have left my kindle fire on all night once with Pandora playing and it did not die. if you leave it playing but hit the power bottom the screen will turn off but music. still play letting you save more battery power.  Pandora is not good nor bad it just depeneds if you really want to PAY for the best servise. if you want free music of your choice on you kendle fire then maybe it is not so bad, but if you want the best then sure you can buy it."
"December 28, 2016","The choice of music is unlimited and easy to listen to on the computer, tablet or other internet medium."
"January 23, 2014","Works for me since local radio is all country. I like smooth jazz like the WAVE in LA. Not there anymore and I miss certain things. This helps fill the gap."
"August 29, 2012","This is a great application made for those that already use Pandora radio. It is perfectly integrated with their online system already set-up, so if you are plugged in online in a browser this application works great.  Problems you'll find if you use the free version of Pandora: -The advertisements frequently pop up into a large portion of the screen and are hard to close but easy to open. -You cannot alter much of the information about a particular radio station (where music comes from such as artists, songs, e.g.) *EDIT* -It is not possible to get a scrolling list of previously played music. You can only view the one you are listening to at the moment. ^ This is now possible. They have fixed it and made the application even better.  My qualms with the application, but it is good nonetheless."
"August 12, 2014","This app used to be good but lately, its been pretty annoying; running in the background eating up my data plan ehrn I thought it was shut down. Plays the same 5 songs in a row on my phone but when I listen yo the same station on my pc, now all these different better songs play. I don't mind the commercials but if I can't get it to shut off when I close the app w/o the need to force close, I might have to let it go."
"August 11, 2017","Love listening to music I like"
"October 26, 2017","GREAT MUSIC CHOICES"
"April 26, 2014","Pandora is great. I use it personally, to enjoy the music I like, but also professionally. It allows me to have at my fingertips music for all tastes. As I visit clients, each can enjoy their favorite music with just a few clicks. And once that choice is there, I can refer to it again and again. Thank you, Pandora!"
"January 29, 2015","Love Pandora! Keeps me entertained while gardening! While working in my yard I pause only to dance!!"
"November 18, 2016","music at my fingers.. love it"
"May 24, 2017","I adore pandora..I can't wait to try their I limited streaming service to avoid commercials!"
"September 18, 2017","Wouldn't accept me at this time."
"May 10, 2017","Love it and use it all the time. Thank you best ever. The only thing i dont like is the commercial."
"August 29, 2015","I was amazed at the selection of music available for no cost to me. I am truly happy my niece got me started with Pandora. My future sure will be a lot happier having all the music surrounding me, I like to turn up the speakers and let it flow throughout my home. Thank you Pandora and my the Lord bless you."
"July 19, 2017","It's ok as long as I can listen to music I listen to ke"
"March 14, 2015","The music fits whatever mood I'm in. I just put in one of my favorite artists, and many selections come up that fit that style, as well as the times, of the artist I've chosen. I really like it. The commercials are quick and minimal. Hard to believe that this is free!!"
"June 24, 2017","All types of music!! Love it!!"
"August 4, 2017","Love Pandora music!!"
"July 22, 2017","works ok and it's free to stream on T-moble"
"August 26, 2017","To much time buffering"
"March 27, 2017","Awesome"
"July 27, 2017","Great except for when you have a multiroom audio system and you try to play two different stations, pandora does not allow this on one account."
"June 26, 2017","Nice radio, frequent ads"
"July 24, 2016","LOVE PANDORA, HAVE MY RADIO STATION SET ON AVENGED SEVENFOLD, 5FDP, DISTURBED, ALTER BRIDGE. I LOOSE MYSELF LISTENING TO MY MUSIC."
"January 6, 2013","I had previously downloaded Pandora for my computer and found its music selections far superior to another free Internet source. I then upgraded to Pandora/One to take advantage of higher fidelity and eliminate ads. When I found I could get a Pandora download for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 "" I jumped at the chance. With the free app from Amazon I now have two sources for quality music: a fixed desktop computer and a mobile Fire tablet."
"January 2, 2013","I love having this app on my kindle. It gives me the opportunity to listen to gospel music and worship God while I've got my hands busy. And I tend to listen to classical music with my headphones on as I read the Bible and other books! I use my Kindle as a tool to better myself so I like the fact that Pandora is an online radio station that I can customize my own channel with out loading my computer with lots of memory!"
"July 30, 2017","Love Pandora.Even my great granddaughters love asking her questions.Love all the music options."
"July 29, 2017","Easy to use app"
"July 17, 2017","I love the way I can stream whatever music I like!"
"July 18, 2017","GREAT MUSIC SELECTION"
"July 7, 2017","Just as described! :)"
"April 20, 2017","Love it"
"May 3, 2017","I absolutely love Pandora! It allows me to hear what I want to hear when I want to hear it without commercials or other interruptions!"
"November 3, 2017","All the goldie oldies."
"August 1, 2017","I prefer ""Google play music"" it has way less commercials,but this is a change of pace. I like how they keep track of the thumbs up songs and make a custom station.I pay for Amazon prime music and use it most often"
"January 30, 2015","The free music portion is great and the app has few to little glitches, but the app isn't quite at the quality of some of its competitors. They need to offer more choice music rather than suggested music, or just music of similar nature to what I requested. Between this and spotify, I choose spotify, but this is still an app worth getting."
"October 18, 2017","have it on 3 of my devices"
"July 14, 2017","great app for music"
"July 22, 2017","easy to load, fun to listen too"
"January 23, 2016","It is a great radio alternative. I like that I can choose the type of music that I enjoy. It has commercials however, I am not turned off by that one bit. I will keep listening and submit a 30 day follow-up review to complete my initial exposure to this type of media."
"May 15, 2017","Love it!"
"September 26, 2017","use it all the time"
"April 17, 2016","Regardless of if my headphones work of not- and regardless of my internet- the music cuts out and will skip at random, although the ads work just fine. However the selection of music is very nice and varied."
"April 23, 2017","Love it"
"July 20, 2017","I love the app"
"July 24, 2017","Love my music"
"December 16, 2014","It's good But some times it doesn't put on the song you like or not the right song but it has a awesome 4 stars and I think it's pretty good but if you get mad go on youtube. But it plays by it self when it turns off and you can shut it off without putting in the password. Like I said it has good features thanks for reading my interview"
"March 3, 2016","I would have given a better review of Pandora , but my music gets interrupted by someone's greed by charging me for free ads . if it is truly my station then allow me to have ads if I like . if not please , let it be without them . otherwise great concept !"
"September 1, 2017","Works well!"
"October 17, 2014","This is an awesome radio station that is free!!! It loads really smoothly on my kindle and I love how u can read,play other apps etc. While listening to your music. I know u can't exactly choose the song u want to listen to but it helps for me to discover other music that I might like. U can also skip a songs if u don't like the one playing."
"August 6, 2014","Love Pandora ! All I listen to ! I have never had such an experience listening to a station that sends you all different kinds of music that lifts your spirit all day long and the choices you can make to create your own station !! I never listen to the radio anymore or CDs best invention ever !"
"June 10, 2013","Finally I can listen to the kind of music I really like! I am just using the free app, so have to put up with commercials, but that's not a big deal. The only 'negative' - and this could be because I don't have the right settings - is that it only plays for about an hour before it shuts down and has to be manually restarted.  I will recommend Pandora to all my friends."
"May 27, 2013","Have liked Pandora from the moment I downloaded it. Fell IN LOVE WITH IT, once I discovered the pay version with no commercials. While there are other ""free"" radio apps...none offer the selection of genres, artist that Pandora does. One example..go to Iheart radio and put in Boy George.. has nothing ..BUT WI T H PANDORA I GOT CULTURE CLUB RADIO..THE SMALL YEARLY FEE IS WORTH HAVING NO COMMERICIALS AND THE BEST POSSIBLE SELECTION."
"August 18, 2015","I have used this app for years and I have always loved it! For some reason this app has not worked this past week. Songs will attempt to load and then a commercial will come on. I can't get any music to play. What's the issue?"
"March 2, 2016","Doesn't play in the Turks and Caicos Islands. That sucked!"
"November 30, 2016","Pandora is apparently not for seniors as it does not have easy readable words to navigate through it. I have now struggled with the new set up. Many times it is not functioning and it is very difficult to navigate through it, just try to delete a station from ""my stations"" and you will see what I mean."
"May 25, 2013","My opinion of this app was that it's no different then when i would listen over the web on my laptop... but then I received this message while listening, it said that I was approaching my 40 hours a month limit on my Mobile device ): I think that's a unrealistic limit to give people, but there's nothing I can do about it. Just thought I would put that info out there, so people are aware of it.. since I was not."
"February 5, 2016","Got to do the thumbs up thumbs down till its dialed in, but when its dialed in its great..... Even the free version..."
"February 10, 2013","Anytime I can listen to music while I'm doing something is fabulous. Now I have the choice of my phone or my kindle! My computer speakers do not work so now that I have this app, I can take the music from room to room and not have to mess with turning it off on my phone or turn it down & then up again or off & on on my phone. Makes life so much simpler."
"August 13, 2017","I LOVE PANDORA....."
"August 7, 2017","Great free music app"
"July 31, 2017","It's okay, it gets of task of the music I asked for."
"May 3, 2017","App works well just like on android tablet and ipad air."
"November 29, 2015","I use this app daily. I love it but wish the option to shelve tracks was handier"
"June 13, 2014","Installed this on my phone so I could use it in conjunction with my new radio I installed in my truck. Wow, what a great music service. I am considering cancelling my XM radio subscription."
"August 11, 2017","So much enjoy Dino piano music radio...several artists also play Christian music."
"April 18, 2015","I love Pandora. I like it better than other music downloads because I can combine my favorite stations and listen all day long without repititions."
"December 30, 2014","I give it a two at best. On Android the app rarely if ever works right and more often than not you get a popup that says ""Pandora can't find any more music, try changing channels"" on every single channel even letting Pandora choose one. And on the web it's recently become totally unusable as it now plays ads THROUGH the music nonstop. And it's it's same stupid ad for some health insurance company over and over over and over. Might be time to kiss this one goodbye. Looks like Pandora just got too greedy."

"December 30, 2013","I loved the Pandora app. When I first got it, it was completely free with ads. The ads were not frequent so that was fine. I established many stations and enjoyed it immensely. Then one day I opened the app. It said UPDATE AVAILABLE"" so I touched the update choice. What a mistake. It told me that Pandora now allowed a limited amount of listening hours. The amount was 20 hours. I was very upset. I am totally disabled. I depended on Pandora each day .It is very hard to lay down and do nothing all day. With Pandora I could change the genre throughout the day as my mood changed. If you've ever had to endure a day of silence ,with no one to converse with you may have a glimpse of an idea of how unnerving it can be. Music has always been a big part of my life now more than ever. I find solace in music. It occupies my mind and distracts me from the reality of how my life has changed. Everyone has heard of the power of music. It is true. It can lift you up,it can calm you down, it can entertain you, help the hours pass quicker or you can choose a genre that will help you meditate when you just need to disconnect. 20 hours is nothing for me. I am usually awake that long each day. Once the update installed it said I had reached my maximum for that month. I had to wait 3 1/2 weeks to listen again. I wrote to see if they could help. I don't have any disposable income to upgrade so I was offered 10 more hours...well that's an extra 1/2 day. So I waited. When I was able to listen again ""for free"" I noticed there were more frequent ads now to take up more time. I had asked what about all the hours not used by listeners each month. I bet not everyone uses their free allotment. Perhaps they could draw from that to help provide More time to those who need it. No response. The UPDATE NOW message was a deceitful ploy to force you to pay for something that ,when you joined ,was free. I often wondered if I hadn't updated maybe I would still be listening for free. So, now I listen to other music apps. I can choose my music,make play lists, etc. and they are completely free. I have also since learned that certain types of apps. including this one do not need to run at start up. This allows them to monitor everything you do. If you have personal information,saved passwords, whatever ,they can gain access and even worse share your info. Do the other stations have the clarity of Pandora, no, but I will continue using them because they are truly free, no veiled traps. I originally would have given Pandora a 5 star rating but I remove 1 star for being deceitful, 1 star for putting a limit on an app that was free and unlimited with never a mention of in app purchasing until the guise of an update was posted. I remove 1 star for increasing the frequency of ads once the limit was attached,reducing actual music time. I remove 1 star for their lack of interest in working out a solution that would allow someone who had grown to depend on their product to literally get them through each day. A way of life they could never understand and I don't wish it on anyone. I have never asked for a hand out but when I asked about all the people who don't use their max and what happens to that time, instead of saying they hadn't considered that or they would check or would even explore a solution they quickly said they would add a few hours and that was that. We were done. Discussion closed. For being so quickly dropped after being a listener for about a year I remove 1 star for disrespecting a customer who was evidently in need of their help. So Pandora you end up worth 1 star for the time I was a listener who thought it was wonderful of you to provide this service for free,although I hadn't known you were secretly monitoring my network usage and gathering information. It's a shame we couldn't work this out but there are always other fish in the sea."
"December 27, 2016","Have only used Pandora a couple of times lately but enjoyed the music a lot. Easy to use with a good selection .Pandora adds to my music pleasure in a good way ."
"July 18, 2017","Great option for listening to my songs that I like."
"July 28, 2017","love it"
"March 25, 2014","Lovely - all my favorite old school concert pianists, some lovely vintage recordings turn up as a nice surprise, and of course, Scarlatti wrote enough pieces to keep anyone happy for a very long time. Interrupted by loud commercials now and then, but it is free, so cannot complain, and if I wanted, I could purchase it and avoid the ads."
"July 30, 2017","Use it every day."

"January 5, 2017","UNABLE TO DOWNLOAD, NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MY DEVICES"
"April 7, 2013","I like Pandora because of there song veriety but the 3 stars is because  1. Other songs show up more than the radio station Songs which forces me to skip then when my skips run out and a horrible song comes on I have to go to another station and listen to another station and deal with it again  2. I have read reviews of Pandora and most songs are not complete only one song occurred that was it  I'm mostly taking the song issue more than the complete songs Pandora stop picking your noses and fix these problems so we could keep listening and give you guys positive reviews its more simple than you think to do it I would be more than happy to delete and start listening to slacker etc"
"October 4, 2017","All the music I WANT to hear!"
"August 21, 2017","Very good."
"November 11, 2016","I would give Pandora 5 stars they keep me updated with new music and artist I never heard of introducing me to new sounds I probably wouldn't have heard of."

"May 16, 2014","I really like having the Pandora app on my phone. I can listen to different stations without having to have a traditional home or car radio. I like that I can take it anywhere with me. I also like that I can go in and out of stations to find a song that I like or want to hear. If I don't like the current song I can just back out and then go to another station."
"July 15, 2017","Great quality sound"
"July 20, 2017","Like it"
"August 7, 2017","Love it"

"January 23, 2017","Depending on what station you listen to, sometimes the songs are very repetitive. I do enjoy Pandora and have listened to it for years and will continue to."
"May 30, 2017","I love being able to listen to the music I like when I want it"
"May 4, 2015","Fantastic App. Bigger choice of various music styles and artists than anyone could hope for. Especially for anyone who likes to hear songs that all have a different tune, and vocalists that don't yell and scream. It's available at Pandora. Plus an endless list of instrumental music. (My Favorite)"
"November 14, 2016","Favorite for music."
"May 15, 2017","Very good a great selection"

"August 12, 2017","this app is the best! oh, also, this is Madeline S. I go by maddie. this app can play sad, happy, romantic, calming, and inspiring songs! if u don't bye this app, you'll regret not having it! to me, it's a must have!"
"December 4, 2012","okay so I was new to Pandora when I first got this app. I figured it put in about five minutes. the User interface is really easy to use. since they updated it a few days before I wrote this review it is on a serious incline. it has a ton of features from music variety to smoother connection, and in some cases higher quality sound. it is one of the best music apps around. don't listen to all the hatred because their reviews are outdated or they are biased. seriously. don't hesitate. its free and there is nothing unlimable about it. even the adds are bearable. and there are ways of skipping so gs you don't like without wasting skips. ;-)  get it or regret it. I would buy it if it was five dollars. that's how good it is. AMAZINGNESSSSSSSS!"
"July 18, 2017","Love it."
"July 28, 2013","This app was an amazing adaptation of the web based Pandora. It was simple to set up and use and played a lot of good songs. The problem came when I logged out of it one night to charge my Kindle, (it drains your battery very quickly and won't charge at all even when no music is actually playing), and I couldn't log in the next day. When I click on the Icon, the title screen comes up, but it won't load pass that stage. I tried deleting it and downloading the app again but nothing will fix it! I hope I'm the only one that has this problem because it is really a great thing, but I just wanted to warn the next person who gets this that this problem might happen to them."
"June 28, 2016","We love pandora. Listen to it all the time. We recently had the opportunity to compare it to satellite radio and we prefer pandora hands down."
"May 12, 2017","I love it. Its easy to use an i enjoy the songs . Thank you"
"March 6, 2014","Thank you for makimg pandora it has and still is helping me with alot of things. So have this idea that I think that you should try. Ok so it could be a special that comes for a week then comes back 2 months later for a week. The special should be that we can have a station that is called my bookmarks and the station should be about where you can listen to your bookmarks in any order and you listen to just your bookmarks.  I hope this sounds interesting to you so I hope that maybw you can try it out if you dont lile it you dont have to keep it   THANKS, a listener...."

"July 18, 2017","ok"
"January 21, 2013","I got the free version and decided to upgrade to Pandora One. The commercials eventually got to me and I couldn't take it anymore. Enough about that. I have really enjoyed making stations and listening to music I would play if I had it, much of which I do own now. The links to buy the music make it simple to expand your collection. I like being able to insert comments and read what others think about the songs and artists. I got this app for my Mom's i-pad and it doesn't have half the flexibility as the one for the Kindle. I even got her Pandora One thinking it would add more usefulness, it didn't. My only complaint is there is only three ratings for the songs; like (thumbs up), dislike (thumbs down), and neutral (do nothing). I wish there was a really, really, really (you get the idea) like the song."
"July 25, 2017","I truly Enjoy Pandora Music as depending on my mood I can listen to whatever type of music I want."
"September 3, 2016","I have loved Pandora for years, but I have always used it on my office computer. I never thought to download to my Kindle until I got an email offer. Loving it!!!"
"July 5, 2017","Fair"
"June 26, 2013","I thoroughly enjoyed Pandora for about a month. Then all of a sudden I couldn't access. It just seems like it is constantly in scan mode during the daytime hours. It returns a message that my station will be back in a minute. At night I can access. But that doesn't help me at work during the day. If I could access it more regularly, I would give it 5 stars cause I love the concept."
"April 29, 2017","Love Pandora!"
"June 16, 2017","Ive used Pandora for a few years now. I like the whole idea. I just wish I didnt have to pay for it in order to enjoy the other perks"
"May 24, 2016","I love the selection of songs on the Chris Stapleton radio. The shuffle play is great because I get to hear music I am familiar with but also am exposed to new artists that I wouldn't otherwise hear. I love listening to Pandora."

"February 4, 2016","Great when it works, which is rarely. When it DOES play it stops when my Fire locks. Now it won't even do that... play button doesn't respond. However, the advertisers will be pleased as ads are all that will play."

"October 21, 2017","get this. pandora fades out songs at any point in a song to put in a commercial. most of them are to upgrade pandora. the rest are local area companies, which in my area is about 4 companies so every 10 min, i get to hear the same commercials. booooo on you pandora. the commercials on the screen where just fine and with all the free music options out there lets be honest, Pandora showed itself to be a fail. deleted and dismissed."

"September 17, 2016","Very good collection of songs and I don't have to pay extra for them. I like the format of presenting songs that I might find similar in nature.I learn about and might even purchase titles that I hadn't been aware of."

"October 15, 2017","Music that I love"
"January 6, 2016","Was unaware I had even started a week-long trial, 3 month later I notice that my card is being charged monthly yet I hadn't used Pandora at all during that time period. I reached out to Pandora and they told me they wouldn't refund any of the charges because of their Terms and Conditions. Left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Not going to use Pandora when I can use Soundcloud instead."
"September 6, 2017","Absolute best app for music. Plays my personal picks at home on wireless speaker and in the car. Music nirvana!"
"January 24, 2014","I absolutely love Pandora!! I listen to it all the time and I can change the music to what ever I'm in the mood for"
"August 7, 2015","Update ruined this app. All it does now on every station is tell me &#34;we've run out of music for this station, please try a different station&#34;.Which I do and then it repeats all over again. Really disappointed. Really liked this app. Used it all the time..."
"July 12, 2012","My Pandora was working wonderfully for awhile. I constantly heard a song that I had ""thumbed up"" so I decided to ""thumb down"" it. It skipped and within half and hour I heard the song AGAIN. If you thumb down a song its supposed to never show back up. Also, it seems that there is a limited amount of thumbed up songs you can have. My biggest complaint is that the app signed me up for the free trial of Pandora One without my permission. I wasnt going to use the free trial until commercials and all the things Pandora One gets rid of really started to annoy me. This app is slow on my phone (Motorola Defy) and drain my battery on it and my kindle fire. I have to listen to music to go to sleep to block out noises (I use earbuds too), so I truly have no other choice."
"November 1, 2017","Pandora is the greatest invention of this century. I love that it connects me to new music and artists. It is all I listen to at home."
"September 28, 2017","this version of Pandora is better than my android phones Pandora app."
"July 21, 2017","Really use it."
"July 18, 2017","I absolutely love it."
"February 27, 2016","Way too many ads. Like 2 or 3 in a row without music in between. And a lot of the songs sound nothing like the related station they're on. So I'm not sure how they select those. Overall I prefer YouTube."
"June 22, 2017","Very pleased"
"December 22, 2013","I love this, easy to use, and selection many different sample of songs that we all can listen to and buy a actual songs or Cds!"

"July 20, 2017","Paid for ad free, still getting ads."
"January 3, 2014","Who doesn't love free music? I know I do. The commercials don't even bother me. My problem is that sometimes I want to listen to a certian artist not artists that are similar to them."
"April 2, 2017","And what's there not to like?"
"September 12, 2017","Nearly right on with the choices of tunes selected on a channel I made. Alas, when listening through the Echo there's no way to say thumbs down get this song off my channel but other than that, it's been right fun having my own personal channels of Wishbone Ash and King Crimson."
"October 3, 2017","I enjoy the music"
"January 28, 2014","I love Pandora. I appreciate that there are no commercials or over-the-top DJs spouting off about things nobody wants to hear. Pandora is just music. I have a station for every possible mood: from Slipknot, to Sting, to Yoga Radio. It's as versatile as I am. The ability to create stations by band, song, or genre. I like having the option of ""thumbs down"" when I don't want a particular song to be part of my listening experience. The variety is fantastic."
"September 5, 2016","I like being able to listen to the music I want to hear."
"August 9, 2017","great"

"August 3, 2017","I love Pandora!"
"April 28, 2012","I have a paying account with Pandora on my desktop computer, and have had one for years. I don't like the blasts of 15-second ads you have to put up with when you have a free account. I was delighted to learn I could put Pandora on my iPhone. That app is free, so you can't beat the price! I have the iPhone with me everywhere, which I definitely cannot say about my desktop, so with this app I am using Pandora far more than I ever did before.  As for Pandora itself, I like that I can set up many different ""channels,"" and Pandora will play a constant stream of similar types of music within a given channel. I can also change channels anytime I like. I often play a channel with rousing music first thing in the morning to wake me up, and a channel with soothing music while preparing for bed."
"October 26, 2016","NOTHNG BUT GREAT"
"July 13, 2017","Luv Pandora"
"April 5, 2013","To many comercials. I do like the fact that I put in the Beattles and got a station with 70's music.What's not to like about that. The best music erra in the last 50 yrs. But the advertisements put me off. I do understand that if it weren't for them -I wouldn't be getting a farout station. My 12 yr. old grandson loves pandora."
"December 29, 2014","Simply the best as you can make your own stations from comedy to oldies. Cheaper than satellite radio endless commercials."
"April 4, 2016","I love it"
"April 16, 2017","It won't let me in"
"September 9, 2013","i am really really thinking about signing up for the permanent, no commercial one, because I simply love this. I was switching back and for from this to Songza, because was stopping my service after 30 days of listening, and cutting me short, I guess because I listened to it too much, without signing up, but I think that has been discontinued, now Pandora is my #1 .....thanks Pandora, and I will be signing up for commercial-free listening soon"
"March 11, 2015","This format allows me to listen to the music of my favorite recording stars without interruption. And I can't really comment about Pandora without saying that I find it so much better than YouTube which now employs the irritating practice of dividing albums into sections - sections which , when one presses PLAY ALL, Don't play in their entirety."
"January 7, 2017","Pandora is so enjoyable!! I selected it because a friend told me about Ian Tyson radio. Then I found out how great it was and have added several other stations."
"April 13, 2017","Works amazingly guess that's why they call it amazon?? Bad joke lol"
"October 14, 2013","This app is perfect for when you don't have a lot of tunes stored on your device or you want to listen to something you don't have. It's a great way to discover new music based on what you already enjoy. The suggestions make sense and I'm very happy to have this. Being an avid music listener, I tend to get bored of what I have easily. Pandora has helped me find some of my new favorite artists and discover old ones I've never heard of before. Great App!"
"March 10, 2016","I like being able to create stations and shuffle them. I learn about a lot of artists I wouldn't have known about any other way. I wish I could select specific songs. Doesn't seem to have some artists when I search."
"May 29, 2017","Enjoy the music but it quits playing for no apparent reason - no ad. This started when they changed their web page."
"September 8, 2017","Great. Thank you"
"October 28, 2016","Why can't I get this on my BlackBerry anymore? I'm sad now. :-( Yes I have an older phone, but don't hate. I like the app. Here lately it is playing too many of the same songs over and over. I might have to learn how to use the sleep function. The app is good at ""guessing"" what you might like."
"October 11, 2016","I love having good music in the background while reading, studying or just working on any project and this app fills that need admirably."
"October 28, 2017","Wish you could replay the song if you like it. The app has some limitations compared to other online music services."
"January 26, 2017","Only plays one song at a time and then I have to unlock my phone and open up the app to get the next song to play. Annoying."
"November 4, 2017","Love love pandora"
"May 20, 2017","Thank u"
"January 24, 2017","I absolutely LOVE Pandora!! I listen to it while I clean house ... exercise and especially when I work in the yard Gospel music is the best!!"
"August 18, 2017","Love it!"
"April 28, 2017","Have been listening to it for years. Love it."
"July 18, 2017","Great selection in music. I listen to various genres and Pandora has not disappointed."

"May 23, 2017","I love listening to Pandora!!!"
"March 24, 2013","Not sure if the permissions changed with the latest update or if I just never noticed, but why does Pandora need access to my personal info and the ability to send emails without knowledge? And not liking the whole ""play two songs then an ad or two"" set up. Not even the radio does that. I'm thinking it's time to go back to an MP3 player and download my music. No ads, no permissions, just me and the tunes..."
"November 9, 2016","Almost unlimited choice songs"
"August 21, 2017","i enjoy listening to my favorite musics before and during work. thank yoy"
"April 23, 2014","No conventional radio station responds to your personal preferences. Pandora does! How cool is that? Seriously, I am still learning how to use this app. I am not a music junkie so this is a first for me. I do not do the iPod and headphones thing, but this app for my Android is just great. There are so many choices!!!"
"October 11, 2015","I really enjoy Pandora - the selection is outstanding - this weekend I enjoyed listening to the Jazzmasters and it was simply the best. The other selections are great but this weekend it's JAZZ BABY!"
"February 14, 2014","I have to say Apple radio is better than Pandora. I really hate to use Pandora anymore because of the ads. If I wanted to hear that many ads I would just listen to my local radio station. The visual ads were one thing, but the audio ones are just annoying. I advise everyone to delete Pandora for the sake of your music listening hours."
"June 21, 2016","Love listening / to music"
"September 7, 2017","Love love love"
"April 20, 2014","I LOVE Pandora, and this app works great! All the features you love on your tablet! Works like a charm. If you can think of the artist or music, chances are they have it!"
"August 6, 2017","Love having choices!"
"November 6, 2013","I found Pandora only recently and at first loved it. I even paid the fee to get the enhanced service without commercials and longer stretches of music. Maybe its because I started listening to it more often at work that I started noticing this: Pandora regularly cuts off songs before they're over. At first I thought they were just chopping off a few seconds at the end, but today they cut off a four minute song after playing it for only 30 seconds. I've really noticed this when trying to use their shuffle feature - it seems a lot worse there.  When I first found Pandora I thought it was awesome. But the whole point of it is listening to songs you like, and a service that cuts off songs you like while you're right in the middle of listening to them - it's becoming highly irritating. In the end, great idea, but I can't recommend them. Certainly not for money, and if people just want to listen for free, well, you get what you pay for."
"July 4, 2017","The best musician"
"February 18, 2016","Thanks"
"January 15, 2017","Play's the music that I like to listen to when I want to . and create my own station's of what I like. Thank you Pandora!!!"
"February 20, 2015","I love this app. The music sounds great. It is very easy to use. I would highly recommend this app."
"June 7, 2013","This is the best music app as far as radio is considered. There are very little adds and you can listen to anything you like. Lets say you like Queen, The Beatles, or Insane Clown Posse. Type the name of any band in, and you can listen to that band and other bands like the band you typed in. If you listen to ICP expect to hear Boondox, Twiztid, Cypress Hill, and much more. For another instant if you listen to The Beatles, expect to get Beach Boys, the Byrds, Dave clarck 5 and many more 60's bands. Last example is Queen. On the Queen station expect to hear, Boston, Adam and the ants, Electric Light Orchestra, and more great 70-80's bands."
"July 21, 2017","Pandora is great, but it tends to repeat songs. It would be nice to have the opportunity to go through and select other songs."
"April 25, 2017","I love this it is so good even thought you have to listen to ads it is great their is every artist I want even if I don't like them"
"November 4, 2014","I love Pandora. I have a sedentary job that allows me to listen. Pandora helps me get through the day with the music that I enjoy!!!"
"August 28, 2015","a zero if i could write it. They don't seem to take into account what i like and don't like. Also, there are song lists for certain subsets of out population but not for others.. For example ""dinner with ladies of song"" but there is not a male version. the CEO is on the liberal New York Times board and I have no doubt this affects his judgement. Stay away and go to Songza or another site."
"July 28, 2017","I LOVE PANDORA. I listen pretty much every day. It's awesome, definitely give it a listen!!"
"November 7, 2016","Love this game!! Very relaxing."
"April 12, 2016","Ever since the last update, the app gets stuck on the ""Loading. Please wait..."" screen and won't play any music. I've contacted Pandora customer support and I am waiting to hear back.  Update: Pandora support helped me figure it out. Hint: A hard reboot is worth more than a dozen soft resets and Resetting to factory defaults =/"
"August 30, 2017","I love pandora!"
"April 19, 2017","What's going on with Pandora upgrades? Where is the OFF button for when I'm done listening on my phone."
"June 27, 2017","nice"
"February 21, 2015","It's o0kay but I don't play enough to rate honestly. I thing I do not like about Pandora is that when I want to hear a song I want to hear it...not a list of other songs before I hear the song I requested in the first place.  L. Cannon, Augusta, GA"
"October 5, 2013","Unable to download completely on my tablet . Shows downloaded but would not open. Kept showing app but did not open. Update: usererror, son educated me and app works fine and is very enjoyable !"
"September 4, 2016","very enjoyable I like being able to select the music that I love and so many artists to select from thank you Pandora."
"July 21, 2017","If you pay to listen to music, but have no control over what's next, nor do you own it, you should at least have the lyrics."
"March 1, 2015","Also not too friendly when you open it and the way it tells you it doesn't work in your country"
"May 14, 2017","👍🏻"
"February 14, 2013","My experience with Pandora has actually been quite nice. My first use was on their mobile app. It took me a little bit of time to learn how to signup and setup my account, and it was a bit annoying, however after that the experience was great. The technology behind Pandora really predicted some really great music for me. I really loved how I could discover new tracks. In fact, even though other services have other features, thus far, Pandora has helped me discover the most music. The app feels solid, nothing brilliant, but it does what I want it to do, play music. It has a modern look, with slight bugs but it doesn`t really matter. Great service, and must try app!"
"November 1, 2014","Pandora is a great concept looks easy to use. It downloads and opens quickly on my Nokia phone . But then Pandora does not work. I get the Pandora logo with a message stating it is having trouble playing my next selection. The low rating is more for the lack of diagnostics than the app itself. I cant rate the app because I can't get into it !!"
"August 21, 2015","have to keep uninstalling It on my phone about once a week and reinstalling it so that it will work in my vehicle. don't know if this is a phone problem or a Pandora problem or if Pandora is just trying to get me to buy the updated version as in Pandora 1, But if that is what their trying to do, it's not going to work. If I can't get the free version to work, I'm surely not going to pay for it."
"December 24, 2015","Pandora is great!"
"November 3, 2013","Awesome way to listen to your favorite artists! I dont know how I lived without Pandora!. Its the first thing I turn on before I head into the kitchen to cook. I love that it stays in the genre I prefer."
"February 7, 2017","very good apps"
"November 2, 2012","I'm increasingly disliking Pandora more and more everyday. Just this morning Pandora crashed on my phone five times before playing a full song, and the night before was a constant crashing battle on my tablet. Then the ads for the nonpaid version are overwhelming, and all too often uninteresting material, but the full version is now FAR too expensive for what little control the user actually has for me to even consider paying. I used to love Pandora."
"May 5, 2013","One of my favorite apps. Only negative things I can this of are that the thumbs down, and up are close by each other, so toddlers accidently press the wrong button. Also, it can get a little repetitive. I hear a lot of accoustic, or live versions right after the original recording of a track. It would be nice to be able to skip more songs, and not have to pay to get rid of adds, but it is understandable, and could be worse with them. They aren't as easy to accidently hit as on some apps, but I did still pay to not have them. I think it was worth paying, so I am not interrupted by loud adds. That can be kind of embarassing at a stop light."
"February 28, 2014","Pandora does an excellent job of playing the music I like. It is better than a theme dedicated radio station because I can mix types of music, such as country and blues. I can take it anywhere on my kindle. Commercials are few and unobtrusive. Superior to subscription satellite radio, this is the best music option for me."
"January 28, 2014","My grandchildren have been telling me about Pandora for quite a while but it's just since I received my new Kindle that I have actually tried it. I love being able to select the music which I enjoy the most while not listening to music I don't like as well. The pop ups are annoying and I understand I'm able to pay eight dollars a month and not have them but that is too expensive for me on a limited budget. How about discounts for seniors???"
"March 15, 2014","I enjoy being able to find songs that are not played on the radio any more, and to focus on my favorite singers. The visual ads are not too annoying but the audio ones are."
"May 3, 2017","Great music selection, really helps pass the time."
"January 31, 2014","Pandora is a wonderful way to hear the music YOU like. Whether it be a particular style or by a particular artist. It even gives you other music ""similar"" to the favorites you pick. You can set your IPad up in any room where you might be working or lounging and with a couple of clicks you have all the music you most enjoy playing for hours or just a few minutes if that is your choice. Great Stuff!"
"August 11, 2017","Great selection of music and good sound"
"February 16, 2015","It was great for the first four months. After that all h - e with double hockey sticks broke lose. Couldn't log in due to tech difficulty. Ridiculous amount of commercials."
"January 6, 2014","One of the things I love most about Pandora is how one artist leads to another, introducing me to music and musicians. The fact that I can access it anywhere has helped me make it through road trips in the car and spinning at the gym. I only wish their play list for some of my favorite artists was longer/deeper. That is a serious limitation that I hope their growth will enable them to gradually overcome."
"November 14, 2016","I have found new music that I have fallen in love with because of Pandora. I don't hear the same songs over and over again."
"June 21, 2014","I enjoyed reading the book. Got it right after seeing the movie, Captain Phillips. I actually enjoyed the movie more because of Tom Hank's acting (last 20 minutes of film was tremendous). Books give a little more detail, but in this case I didn't miss out by just seeing the movie. However, the book was worth reading."
"September 20, 2015","Dont pay attention to the excessive ads, skip limits, and cutting the song off halfway through and Pandora is a awesome music app. I have enjoyed my time with Pandora and no one does music playing better. I recommend it to anyone who has ears."
"September 30, 2017","great"
"November 4, 2017","Pandora is simply awesome. The fact that I live six blocks from this awesome place makes it even better. Good job Pandora.."
"August 15, 2017","Always works and a very stable app. The music playlists are good and with the ability to remove songs is a strong plus."
"July 31, 2017","Wow what a great musical listening experience!"
"January 2, 2013","My wife introduced me to this system, she listens to it in the morning when she isn't in the mood to listen to radio and the yelling commercials. I recently started doing the same thing, and really enjoy being able to select the music I want. Thanks Pandora."
"October 20, 2017","I love hving my choice of music wherever I go!"
"August 20, 2017","I listen to Pandora practically everyday. I really like their feature allowing me to create stations around various genres and bands, so if a song pops into my head (and I know the band/singer doing it) I can create a station using that name and Pandora will play more of their stuff along with similar music from other artists. Great to have it playing in the background in my office while I'm working. Two thumbs and two big toes up."
"November 12, 2016","Really just started listening, but I really like it."
"March 19, 2016","It is the best app ever since I was born"
"August 13, 2016","I love this app u can get all your favorite music in one place but you can't request songs can like them and they will show up on your thumbprint radio."
"May 18, 2015","Too many commercials and dead space. Good for stumbling across songs that I then purchase from a music site and add to my MP3."
"May 23, 2014","Love this app. Would love it more if there was a search capability to find older music or artist. Being a member of old school, there are older tunes that would flow nicely in todays musical mix! I know there are people out there that could mix older tunes with today's music to create a beatuiful and relaxing experience"

"December 7, 2016","Okay. first this is a great app to have. I loved it when I was living in the USA. But now I am living in France and the app does not work here. I miss mu music that I used to listen to. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix it to were I can listen to Pandora's music again."
"January 14, 2014","I thoroughly enjoy the music and there is a great variety. Very easy to listen to. Love it and would refer it to others."
"March 25, 2013","Pandora is one of the best things that I ever had on my computer. To be able to listen to the type of music that I enjoy is remarkable. The music selections that are played are everything that I truly enjoy. Very rarely do I ever have a thumbs down on my ratings. I would highly reccommend this to any music lover. It is just like magic. Puff and the music that you love is there."
"January 8, 2014","I love this app. I'm still a little be too new to my way around Pandora, but what I know about it I enjoy. Perfect for when I am reading a news article, enjoying a new book or just browsing the web. It is going to take a few more days for me to learn my way around it, but it isn't difficult. It is rich with ""customizing"""
"August 20, 2017","Great"
"November 15, 2012","Great app, simple to use and gives me songs I actually really like. The only problem is the menu button does not seem to work for me so I have to press pause on a song and hit the home button on my device instead of being able to press 'quit'. Please fix."
"March 26, 2013","i love this app! but only the paid version. the ads in the free version are annoying beyond words. i like how you can customize your playlists, discover new artists in genre you like. i haven't listened to the radio in years because i'm sick of commercials and how they beat all songs dead by repeating them every 3 songs. so discovering new artists and music is now done with Pandora. i do wish they would allow you to skip an unlimited amount of tracks, esp when your a paid member. it doesn't seem fair to force you to listen to songs you dislike or are not in the mood for.  i highly recommend Pandora!"
"July 25, 2015","I love Pandora!! It allows me the chance to pick the music style I want to listen to and make a channel that plays similar music. I find new artists that I had never heard of before everyday. If I don't like a song they are playing all I have to do is give it a thumbs down and it disappears from the playlist. I have channels I pick to clean house by, dance to, and just hang out to. Love Pandora!"
"September 1, 2016","Boomer E is an intelligent conservative sports caster that knows football specifically...and Ice Hockey...and NY sports..."
"August 7, 2015","Pandora worked great until yesterday. None of my stations are available on my kindle fire HD. I had the same problem on my iPhone, but that is now fixed. When will it be fixed for the kindle?"
"June 24, 2014","The music is good, the thing is easy to use, there aren't too many radio interruptions, maybe three per hour. The thing I don't like is it asks for your age and gender. Suggestion: put the wrong gender down so if your a man you don't get all of these &#34;single woman&#34; pop up ads and women vise versa."
"November 29, 2015","Great app for listen music"
"July 24, 2013","It's great that Amazon has the Pandora app for the Kindle and Androids. Getting it from other sources means you can get modified code. So far I haven't found any Amazon apps that have been bloated or modified."
"March 17, 2014","I like Pandora Radio, even if it has commercials. I'm able to have several stations. some times it keeps playing music i don't love, but don't hate, but it irritates me after 3/4 song. Now, the advertising has gotten overwhelming the only thing is that Pandora radio is mostly music and half of the advertising is not heard. I do enjoy the new sleep timer, very convenient."
"November 10, 2015","Nice choice of music and channels. However, while using my mobile device I'm asked every few hours if I'm still listening. At home I'm never asked throughout the day if I'm stlll listening when I use my blue ray player. I do enjoy the music, Thank You.🎶"
"July 22, 2017","great"
"June 14, 2017","Easy to use"
"July 11, 2013","DON'T download if you want to listen to what you typed in. You won't always get what you expect. Anyways, this app us AMAZING! You can listen to music while you are playing games or even if you turn off your screen on your Kindle Fire HD! Live it!]...] Was this review helpful?"" I need other people to see this. Thank you for reading!"
"October 21, 2013","I think this app is amazing. I love music and this app let me listen to all the music I love. I strongly suggest that if u love music, down load this app I promise u'll love it. The only thing I wish good change would be for the user to be able to replay the whole song instead of just a sample or wait till it comes on again, but otherwise I love and I hope u love it too! Lol"
"November 8, 2016","Love."
"November 10, 2014","The latest update has eliminated song lyrics, a HUGE miss. Also, I was paying $36 a year, $3 a month, for Pandora One. Not a bad price for no ads and a higher quality stream. Now, they want $4.99 a month, a HUGE 166% PRICE INCREASE, with no annual payment option. Thanks, but no thanks. Given Pandora's limited song repertoire and excessive ads and commercials, it's just not worth it. it's time to move on. There are better options out there."
"January 7, 2014","Great station with many selections for any flavor your looking for. My favorite is Gospel music and Jazz, it will also let me pick my favorite songs that I can listen to at any time, get on board."
"July 3, 2017","I have adhd and this is perfect for when I can't choose a song. Needs to have unlimited skips if you have it for more than an x amount if time though"
"June 18, 2017","Use it all the time. Don't need radio."
"March 6, 2016","I am able to listen to my favorite artists and songs for hours. A simple thumbs up or down button expanded my listening pleasure by Introducing similar types of songs and artists."
"March 6, 2016","DL this about 4 times and it still won't play"
"May 15, 2015","Love the music and I don't mind listening to the short commercials."

"January 10, 2014","The world sure has changed. I wish this stuff had been around when was a kid. Remember all those dang cassette tapes and later CDs we lugged around? This app is a a straight up free juke box."
"February 5, 2016","Just get Spotify..."
"August 31, 2017","Needs more skips and more variety"
"September 25, 2015","I've been a fan (and user) of Pandora for years. So far, I've created about 20 stations, based on genre or artists. I play Pandora on my phone when working out, in the car when traveling, or on laptop when I'm just sitting around the house."
"November 8, 2015","Love it. Much better than iheart radio"
"October 3, 2017","Damn good music, you can pick and choose. Love it"
"January 11, 2017","Pandora gets me through my work day. I love the variety of music. Christian rock is my favorite I like the fact that its free."
"October 17, 2017","I get all my music varieties without any hassle. Listened to songs I have not heard in years."
"September 26, 2015","I like this app, especially the ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" rating scale. What I would LOVE to have as an option on this app is to stream the radio versions vs. the explicit versions of the songs. Overall, I'm very pleased with the app."
"February 17, 2016","LOVE IT! It really assists me in finding other artists that are in the same genres that I like listening to. However, when I just want to listen to that ONE artist - I can not.  It is awesome 99% of the time. xoxo"
"October 3, 2017","Easy to use"
"September 12, 2016","Love the music. I need not say more."
"March 29, 2014","Easy access to music I enjoy no matter where I am. Sometimes car radio reception isn't too good in our area, but I can get good reception on iPad and kindle fire driving on bumpy roads and in poor reception areas . Also easy to carry around the house or while outside. Makes listening to music you enjoy so easy."
"July 27, 2017","I love Pandora. I've had it for ages, it's literally the best internet radio station!"
"January 31, 2017","Have"
"October 16, 2017","Working on acquainting myself with it."
"July 18, 2017","Nice mix of tunes. Easy to use."
"July 18, 2017","It does not work we have Pandora on another device which is great but on the fire it does not work"
"June 18, 2015","What did we do before Pandora?! I can choose a music genre a listen to ad free music. I often find music that I had not heard before that quickly become one of my favorites. And I can listen to this great music while working on my laptop, tablet or stream it through our TV. What's not to like?! Thank you, Pandora!"
"January 18, 2014","I chose 5 stars because Pandora provides free music. They have any artists you'd like to listen to and when you create a station you're able to add another artist to play on that same station. You can also like or dislike any song which helps Pandora know what you like. However, if you don't like commercials, then you need to purchase Pandora which I believe is very cheap. I would recommend this to anyone who likes music."
"November 5, 2015","My only problem is the lack of a timer. I would like to set it to fun for, say. 1/2 hour and then turn off. Then I could go to sleep to music. I really like the huge selection of artists I can hear. I also like hearing it on my blackberry while moving around."
"March 23, 2016","I have a blackberry classic and when I got this it took forever to install and then when I tried to sign up the top bar covered the username blank space. Please fix this, I love Pandora."
"June 29, 2017","I hare that it is not working for me but it really is a good app that you guys made it has some really good music"
"November 15, 2016","It works great on my kindle."
"November 7, 2017","Love it!"
"October 23, 2011","I have been a Pandora fan since its very beginning, and had it on each of my BlackBerrys before switching to Android and the Droid Charge. It almost always picks mosaic I love from my seed songs and artists and I can't begin to tally the number of artists I discovered on Pandora.I've tried the copycat services, but they don't even begin to compare to Pandora. I believe the difference is that Pandora has humans do the categorizing rather than a computer. If you are serious about music --- it is the center of my life --- you must get Pandora AND sign up for the paid Pandora One subscription. Out is definitely worth the $35 of you listen even a fraction as much as ii do.Out is the only service I pay for other than Sirius, but that isn't really about tykes music."
"September 21, 2014","I listen to music based on my mood. I love the flexibility of how Pandora chooses my music. They play songs that I have long forgot about. I love the troops down memory lane. Thanks!"
"October 30, 2015","I would give it 5 stars but I dont like that you can only skip so many songs per channel and I thought that when you bookmark a song it goes to a folder that you can play at any time. It doesnt though. Other than that, I like it so far. I have only had it for a week."
"October 7, 2013","All I get is a blue screen that says Pandora. That's it. So I'll be going on over to TuneIn Radio. Get it together Pandora -_- ..... Get it together."
"September 1, 2017","You can pick any type of music or artist anytime for free!"
"December 1, 2016","I personally love pandora, the interface is really user-friendly and they offer a huge variety of music genres I really would like to add the mood option that other music services offer like google music but besides that im really happy with Pandora"
"November 13, 2015","I love how you can make your own 'stations"".A large selection from; New age to comedy to rock to rebel country!"
"June 15, 2012","come on people! stop being so friken stupid! Did you know that paitents is a virtue? Did you also know that if the people that believed the stupid retarted impatient people who rated this app badly because of the adds d not possess this virtue? well its true. the adds are not that long, you can listen to your favorite music and discover different music, and guess what... its all free! the adds are fine they are not that horrible they last like 1 minute to at least 20 seconds. and if you run out of skips just make a new channel that is basically the station you ran out of skips for. please listen to me and use your common sense. This is why I rated Pandora five stars. Sorry for the long post."
"October 27, 2013","I give three stars because I have kindle (regular)and when I go on trips I never get to here music so then I will tell give 5stars if u have cellphone   Ok so u want Pandora it's free free music!!!!! Get out of here that is awesome how u get free music and pulse I have my kindle for almost a year restarted 3 times and still saves my account only if u sigh on the same account"
"February 23, 2014","Haven't been using for too long (maybe a 1.5 months), but already love it. The smart radio station feature is quite good. It gets better the more you use it."
"April 20, 2017","Too many ads or it would get a higher rating."
"June 10, 2016","Love it! Love the suggested music, wonderful muic!"
"October 21, 2016","I love the music and if u get the app u get free Amazon coins and you get free 50 dollars to spend on your Amazon apps"
"May 3, 2017","Love Pandora have a station for every mood"
"July 20, 2016","The app constantly tells me everytime I sign in that they are experiencing technical difficulties. I wanted iheartradio however amozon does not have it. I settled for Pandora and at first I loved it now however not so much. I have a kindle fire and it just never wants to work on it."
"November 8, 2016","Pandora is so easy to use. I love that."
"January 8, 2015","Words cannot describe my joy with Pandora. I am constantly learning about new music I would never hear about otherwise. The paid version is well worth the price. By indicating what you like and do not like you channels will get more and more tuned to your taste."
"November 16, 2016","It's okay"
"June 13, 2017","I love Pandora...I have lots of stations for every mood and occasion!"
"June 7, 2016","Its Pandora and works great on a kindle and fire tv"
"October 5, 2017","I have only have had it my kindle for 1 day, but so far I am impressed!"
"August 26, 2017","One of the best song apps"
"July 20, 2017","As a music lover,I listened to Pandora every where I go,Pandora you get my vote of 5 stars 😊"
"November 30, 2012","This review is not about the quality of the music or the ads. i spend long hours on the computer and i like to have some nice background music. My dogs like having it as well.  I connect it to my stereo for a quick streaming experience. I used to play it on my iPhone, but then used my fire so i won't need to disconnect every time i got a phone call.  The main problem is that the app will stop playing when there is a Ad. This happens less frwequently with PandoraOne, but still happens each 30 - 40 minutes. A hassle since i need to turn off the app and then re-launch it.  Not sure why this still not fixed."
"August 21, 2017","I love Pandora I will don't like the commercials how much would it cost to have Pandora a month"
"January 14, 2017","I was a real novice & found this to be quite easy. I can now take my favorite music with me wherever I go. Thank you, Pandora."
"September 16, 2017","Enjoyed"
"July 22, 2017","C'mon its Pandora what else needs to be said?!?!?!?"
"January 30, 2017","I listen all the time..They play a great variety of music that I enjoy. .With very little commercial interpretations..."
"July 9, 2015","Its perfect, you cant go wrong with a radio app that is so easy to use and you get to pick your genre. I have found many other genres of music that I like through Pandora. It has helped me expand my musical pallet. I have tried other radio apps but I just use Pandora now. No need to fix it, if it aint broke:) JUST DO IT!(R)"
"August 23, 2017","ive had pandora longer than amozon and its allways been great"
"July 22, 2017","So when I downloaded this app, I found that it's conveniently possible to have it play in the background, on your phone. I didn't mind the idea of watching ads, because it's a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow. But if you ask for music from a certain band, it will give you a 1/6 chance of hearing that band, a 2/6 chance of hearing a similar band, and a 1/2 chance of hearing a band that is nothing like what you asked for. But that's not all; the graphic ads pop up randomly, overtop 3/4 of your playlist navigation, which often causes any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music, to send you to another ad. I wish the annoyance ended there, but for every minute of music you're given, willingly or not, it gives you a minute and a half of pop-up video ads as well. Trying to flip to another song only results in it informing you that you're not allowed to skip songs, if you try more than 3 times an hour, and forget useful buttons like ""rewind""; if you try to tap the track to hear something again, it only puts a "" like/dislike"" on the track. I was unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten seconds over again, MARKED THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN, and my attempt to change the thumbs down mark to a thumbs up, when clicking the previously listed song, put a like on its album, didn't take the dislike off the song, and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I didn't want to be hearing. In essence, I wasted twice as much time listening to ads and songs I didn't want to hear, than hearing music I actually wanted, AND I gave these twits my e-mail for that lovely opportunity."
"November 22, 2014","What can I say? Great app!"
"July 22, 2017","Its okay. Used to pay for it. Finally stopped paying for it. Supposedly they offer unlimited skips. Which they said they had before. They still probably don't. Thwy let you skip 5 songs and say sorry we know you're sucker and paid  for this but we aren't lerting you hear just what you want. Here are a few songs that are free that suck listen to them. Oh you made a Dave Matthews band station? Sorry you'll hear 3 then have to change it hahahahahhahaha."
"April 3, 2015","Listen to any type of music. Should have this installed in cars"
"November 17, 2015","nice"
"December 3, 2015","I use Pandora a lot at work. I can skip forward to a new song. It would be nice to skip back. I find it a bit clunky and hard to figure out how to maneuver. Also hard to figure out how to close the program."
"August 17, 2017","Excellent, no commercials, no disc jokeys, no depressing new...just the music I enjoy."
"November 16, 2016","Many música to listen love it."
"July 24, 2014","Easy to work with and the variety of music is great. I join the subscription for no interruption or ads so it is great."
"March 5, 2014","I love this app it plays a great mix of music and has way fewer commercials than the radio and I wouldn't be able to make my commute without this app"
"January 14, 2014","I like the variety of music Pandora has to offer, but do not like the fact you're limited to how many times you can zip through songs within a specified amount of time. I also find, at times, it takes several minutes to log on to Pandora. When I want to listen to my music, I want it to be NOW, not later. Thus the reason for my two star rating."
"July 22, 2012","Do you hear commercials when listening to free local radio? Of course, so why all the complaining? There are a few more commercials than before, but not that many and far less than local radio, and you can pay to have none at all. You can get a great varity by entering you favorite artist, then choose some preset stations and choose shuffle all stations. And the best thing is my car stereo has bluetooth and I listen to pandora with my phone and it plays through the stereo, I've had very few lost connections with 3G and rarely have songs cut off like others have said, but it does happen on occasion. I also play it on my home computer. Its free and I love it."
"April 7, 2015","This is my favorite music app. It works on all of my phones, tablets, tvs & computers. The kids have their playlists and I have mine."
"October 22, 2016","Love it"
"October 8, 2017","Just great, LOVE it!!!"
"September 5, 2017","Love love love pandora"
"October 30, 2017","As expected"
"May 11, 2017","Turn on as soon as I wake up in morning"
"August 27, 2017","One of the best stations to listen to."
"August 28, 2017","It's ok but they seem to play some songs over and over and over until I am sick of songs that I once loved. Other songs that I have liked rarely get played."
"March 26, 2014","I like being able to pick my own music and listen to the artists I grew up with. It is great being able to play just the kind of music I like and the commercials are very few. The app also plays longer than the Pandora does on my computer. There I have to keep going and indicate I am still listening. I like that I don't have to rush over and hit the Yes, I am still listening."
"October 26, 2013","We love Pandora. We create our own channel by giving song a thumbs up or down. They program ""learns"" what you like and will start to play the songs and artists you like. You can make multiple channels so you can switch between genre whenever you like. The kids even have a kid friendly channel. We did go commercial free on ours. Just personal choice there."
"December 31, 2012","I use pandora ALL THE TIME. great music, lots of variety. seems like your channels get more crazy the more channels you have. for example, christian rock started showing up on my coheed and cambria station after i added a b. reith channel. its kind of neat, but sometimes a bummer because channels can start to sound the same after a while. you do have an ad's free option if you purchase a yearly subscription with pandora."
"January 20, 2017","I give Pandora a 5 because it's so easy and to me the best music of all time all categories. Thank you Pandora."
"October 30, 2015","We enjoy listening to Pandora ,especially Amici Forever. We bring either an iPhone or iPad out in the back yard in the afternoons and relax with Pandora. It's also enjoyable while driving. The music choices are many."
"March 14, 2017","Love how u add other artists to my station"
"September 26, 2016","This is great for listening to your playlists at the gym. I usually switch back and forth between reading and listening to music when I'm on the treadmill at the gym. With Pandora, I can do both with just my Fire tablet. All your Android devices can have the same Pandora settings, or you can create a different account for your Fire and have a different music mix."
"October 21, 2016","I love this. Almost as good as Sirius XM. And no charge!"
"June 8, 2017","I love Pandora I love listening to music😉."
"August 12, 2013","I absolutely love this radio. It plays tons of similar tracks that are exactly what i want to listen to. I would recommend it for some one who is more open minded about music, not as specific because it doesnt always play the song that you are wanting to hear, however it might play a song that you dont know that could be better. Its great for some one who is wanting to widen their musical horizons."
"July 26, 2017","Great variety of music love pandora!!!!"
"January 3, 2017","Great, can listen to what ever I want to when ever I want to."
"February 18, 2015","Anytime I can hear my 80's music - its a great day! Love Pandora!"
"August 15, 2014","Pandora.com is a wonderful way to personalize the music you want to hear. No more random music you don't like. Create radio stations for your own personal taste and mood. I love it!!"
"October 23, 2016","Love Pandora. I listen to it at work also."
"June 19, 2017","I love the variety of songs."
"November 2, 2017","Pandora is simply a very great idea I like it as I use it right now but one day as the monthly price goes down I might purchase a membership with Pandora"
"June 27, 2017","so far so good I like the mix of music keep up the good work"
"November 22, 2013","Pandora is nice/fun app to have on your kindle fire. If you like music......you'll like this app. You can can listen to your favorite songs /any time you want to."
"June 11, 2017","I refuse to sign up for a plus membership."
"August 24, 2015","I love this app and all the music it gives me, that I actually enjoy! But, it constantly has problems for me with not completely starting. I'll open the app and it will close. Even after restarting the tablet a few times it still does it."
"May 7, 2017","I love that I can use this on my Apple TV and my Roku. The fact it mixes up all my favorite types of genres I like listening to."
"October 26, 2014","I love pandora. But in the last 2 days when I try to log on it just says &#34;we are experiencing technical difficulties.&#34; I know I entered my email and password right because I wrote it down on a piece of paper, and when you type in a letter it shows up until you type in the next letter. And I entered it at least 15 times. Same with the e-mail minus the hide the letter part."
"August 11, 2017","Great source for all genre's of music."
"August 30, 2012","I love pandora app because it has every kind of usic on it and if your in the mood for lets say, country, they have all kinds of country songs, even on the radio. If you want to hear all of your radio selections all you have to do is push the shuffle button and you can hear all the songs you want. Before I got the pandora app I was thinking, 'Is it one of those radios where you have stations like 98.7 and 95.5. Is it a kind of radio where you can't pick your songs, author or genre? Totell you the truth, you can choose your own genre, and author(s)put you can't pick the song. Pandora doesn't have station either, which I'm thankful for."
"November 23, 2012","I don't get Pandora available on amazon cause of that you YouTube app were you can download music from YouTube to your amazon tablet or phone with wifi but on Pandora you have to have wifi to even listen to it!!! I prefer the YouTube app over Pandora any day!And I think you will to! So don't install this install the YouTube app!(PS.THE YOUTUBE APP IS TOTALLY FREE NO TRICKS! PS. JUST SEARCH YOUTUBE ITS THE FREE ID ONE) (PPS.HOPE YOU LIKE THE YOUTUBE APP!)"
"May 1, 2017","Listen to it all the time without interruption"
"April 19, 2016","the app doesnt open up let alone play music...having the same problem with youtube, both are on fire tablet....i have a 4 year old Motorola photon phone that streams with NO PROBLEM....."
"March 29, 2016","This is a great resource for those who desire good quality-godly music."
"November 11, 2016","I cant get it to work on my pc-sometimes it works and others it doesn't or will play a couple tunes then stop. Very frustrating for me."
"December 23, 2015","My Pandora won't play on my Kindle Fire. I know that Pandora ids usually one of the best music radios that let you customize what you want to hear. However, this time it was poorly excuted on my tablet"
"February 28, 2012","Pandora App on Kindle Fire works like a charm!. Love the interface and Pandora's way of recommendations of music I listen to. I can see the Album Art and details about the artists. Streaming quality is pretty good.  FYI - The pop-up Advertisements are there (Apart from regular Ads between songs randomly) as this is the 'free' version of the App and it bothers me at times as I cannot Skip tracks when Ads are present but I can live with that for now knowing that it is a free Application.  I also like that you can let Pandora stream music in the background while I do other things on Kindle Fire. It is a nice way listen to music when you are connected to Wi-Fi."
"June 24, 2017","Love pandora!"
"December 22, 2016","I love Pandora Media. It is one of only a few stations that plays Oldies but Goodies music for us senior citizens."
"January 31, 2017","Like this app."
"April 21, 2014","I rated it why do I need to write a review? If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is."
"February 21, 2014","Pandora is a fine service, but I hardly ever use it, as I have too much music and media around my house. There's no time to be into all of it too often."
"July 17, 2014","This app is so awesome, I was at a cookout with family and no one thought to bring music and luckily I had my Kindle Fire HD and downloaded Pandora. Instant music and the fun really began. Everyone was singing along, dancing, laughing and really enjoying the day. The day was great thanks to Pandora !"
"September 19, 2016","I have used this for about 3 years. I just tried Spotify and deleted it after 10 minutes! This app is soooo superior. The premium is the BEST and well worth the price."
"April 19, 2017","Love my music"
"March 9, 2014","The only thing I wish Pandora would do is if I want to listen to a certain group, band or artist, it would only play that artist and NOT artists like them."
"September 29, 2013","I liked this app a lot. It is great for listening to music on a mobile device and it stays signed in to your account. My only problem with it is that it picks songs for you based on the station you create on it. You can't actually pick the song itself, so there are some songs you don't like on it. Pandora learns what you like and don't like by you giving the song a thumbs up or down. Overall, it's a great app. I would have given it 5 stars if you could pick the song!"
"October 22, 2016","I love Pandora and listen only to Pandora."
"July 28, 2017","I got email asking for 6 month trial for the top of the line super duper (where when you ask for a song, you actually get that song) - and it doesn't work that way on my lap top, and it didn't convert to my phone/tablet - I now get advertisements for the same thing there. How many $9.99's do they want from me?"
"August 4, 2012","I don't know what to say that probably hasn't alreadt been said in praise of PANDORA on mommy KindleFire. Name an artist and voila, you have a ""station "" that will deliver tunes by that artist and similar artist. One caveat, if you listen a lot (and I do) you will soon recognize the limit to the tunes by your rave artist that will repeat. Usually these will be the songs you would expect on a ""greatest hits "" album and often that is exactly where they come from. But hey, if you get bored with the repeats, quickly create a new station. This app can't. Be beat for a source of tunes for your KindleFire or other aneroid device."
"February 9, 2016","Love Pandora"
"September 21, 2016","I love it"
"September 15, 2017","WORKS WELL"
"October 4, 2017","Great music."
"November 13, 2015","Pandora is like the best thing ever in my life. If I don't have Pandora on my day will not go well. I wake up to Pandora and fall asleep listening to Pandora. To be able to listen to whatever station, and to 👍your favorite songs is awesome. #TeamPandora"
"January 5, 2014","This app is amazing free music and You get to take your favorite station There is so much to love on Pandora I personally love it me and my sister are obsessed with it I use it when I'm bored or I just want to dance around And also I use it when I really don't want to listen to apps music so I turn on Pandora and listen to music instead of the Music on the app Hope you get Pandora and I hope this helped bye"
"April 24, 2014","Love Pandora!! Keeps me entertained at work, but also many other times of my day! Best thing ever!!! Variety at it's best :)"
"October 8, 2017","Couldn't live without Pandora. I have given up Series for Pandora where I get to choose what I want to listen to"
"January 25, 2017","Need to become familiar with it so far it seems great! Nice to Listen to music of choice."
"October 3, 2017","Love it just wish there weren't so many commercials."
"June 17, 2017","😊👌👍"
"June 24, 2017","Great app"
"May 5, 2017","Product received just as promised"
"August 22, 2013","You start off loving it and the world looks beautiful, but then it starts messing up. It will stop mid song and move on another, or it will just stop playing and you have exit and start again. I could tolerate it if these instances were few and far between, but they're not, and once they start happening they keep happening.  That's not to say you shouldn't use it, because let's face it for free music listening it's pretty much your only option, but know that you are at some point going to be yelling at your phone over it."
"June 2, 2017","Great for a free app, repeats songs more often than expected but all in all pretty good."

"April 29, 2015","It's amazing. I had heard before about it but never gave it a try.... I created a couple of station and it's amazing how it plays the songs I want to hear.  Just make sure to 'like' the songs you want while they are playing and with time the station will be very accurate playing the songs related to that station."
"June 10, 2017","Great for children of all ages. Soothing, quiet or peppy dance music."
"January 2, 2015","This is so cool, especially being able to mix up the music, and have no ads but also get recommendations to listen to now and then."
"June 30, 2017","good"
"February 6, 2017","Not bad."
"October 24, 2013","Who does not love music? This app is starting to be more and more popular than ever, and it's even becoming standard now with recent vehicles purchases. Easy to install and easy to use right of way."
"March 6, 2016","Beautiful music, excellent selections and the ability to give a thumbs up or thumbs down so they can make the music suit you even better. It's a great addition to my computer!!"
"April 1, 2017","Great Music app. Long time user."
"May 16, 2017","use it from time to time"
"October 25, 2013","I've switched over to iTunes Radio for the most part but still use Pandora for the kids on the morning drive to school. Pandora does the best job at sticking to your specific genre selection (kids, halloween, 4th of July) than any other streaming service out there. Great job but too many commercials for me to use as my main streaming station."
"June 25, 2015","LOVE, LOVE, LOVE PANDORA!"
"October 31, 2016","Great!!!!"
"July 15, 2013","I undersand that ads are what makes it free, which is why it is still a four star, but a new add every time you skip, or change station, as well as every three or four songs seems a little much. Interface is pretty good. If you add enough variety the stations do an decent job of fitting your tastes. Eats up data if you are not on a wifi network, but that is to be expected."
"June 13, 2017","A+ Great Product"
"January 2, 2014","MY DAUGHTER PUT IT ON FOR ME AND I DID NOT THINK I WOULD USE IT BUT IT IS A GREAT WAY TO LISTEN TO MUSIC. YES, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE."
"December 27, 2014","The premise is wonderful... if you like this, then you may like this. I have made a lot of stations for myself, However when I select shuffle the stations the program seems to play the same few stations that I started with, and along with that, the same songs from those same stations. If I could eliminate that glich, it would be five stars all the way."
"August 1, 2016","just not for me"
"November 3, 2017","Only use pandora and Facebook Messenger,,,that’s all I use"
"October 11, 2016","The music selection is great and it's never boring. Love it."
"June 20, 2015","I love to listen to this station, it has all the choices of music for anyone personally my wife and i listen to contempary christian music and most of our favorite artist are on there and even similar music we have not heard but now are fond of."
"November 29, 2012","Below, you will find my old review for how the App worked on my first gen Kindle Fire. With regards to my Kindle Fire HDX, I would say that performance and functionality have gotten a whole lot better. That said, my taste in music services has changed. I would recommend instead, either Songza or Spotify. Still, Pandora is a pretty solid offering and the app is several times better than it used to be.  ***Old Review 2012*** This app used to be a good one on the Kindle. Now it plays two songs and just stops. Completely Useless. It's part of the reason why I don't subscribe to avoid having ads. Based on other reviews, they don't seem in a hurry to fix this, so why bother upgrading? Bad Business.  Update (Same day): So after posting this review, I removed the app from my Kindle Fire and then re-downloaded it from the App Store. Now it appears to be working as it used too. So I've changed the rating to reflect this.  Another Update (Same day): So it appears to play the songs without any problem, but when an ad pops up, the app just stops and you have to quit and relaunch to get it going again. So even a reinstall won't fix this. I'll reiterate as mentioned before, Bad Business!"
"February 24, 2015","Love this app great music many stations to choose from"
"June 12, 2017","Overall happy but I do hope they allow for more skips for non paying subscribers."
"May 25, 2017","Awesome"
"April 28, 2012","I finally loaded the Pandora app the other day on advise from my daughter. After reading lots of bad an so - so reviews, I was skeptical, but didn't think my college student would steer me wrong.  I created a variety of stations among different genres and have beenvery happy with all my choices and most of Pandora's too. I haven't had to give many thumbs down. Even stations I've created that I thought would be just to try out, have become some of my faves!  The brief commercial breaks aren't a problem at all.  If you are on the fence like I was at first, give it a try, I believe you will get addicted like I have."
"January 9, 2017","Pandora always supplies the dopest jams for me during my workouts in the gym. Thanks Pandora!"
"May 23, 2017","Love it"
"May 31, 2014","This streaming station is great for finding music you like. The kids like it to when searching for disney music."
"May 23, 2017","Great app. To bad there so many commercials ."
"April 30, 2017","doesn't work for my needs"
"January 1, 2015","I love Pandora because it gives me free music but it has a lot of inappropriate content so if Pandora would warn you before saying things that they shouldn't it would be 5 stars but they don't so I say 2 stars and I recommend that parents with young children should not download this app!"
"November 2, 2014","I enjoy Pandora as a whole. But it recently stopped working on both my android and then my kindle, support send to uninstall it and then reinstall it. But I think by doing this I lost all the current stations I had from the first installation. So I'm not happy about that. But over all I do like Pandora."
"July 19, 2014","A nice service, but too many ads and interruptions on the free side. If you can afford the PREMIUM service, Pandora is THE leader in high-quality audio delivery."
"June 27, 2015","I hate the commercials"
"March 28, 2017","good for night time when i have my 3 year old son listen to contemporary christian, contemporary gospel, or nature music."
"December 1, 2014","I hate it when you have to sign in with your private information in order to be able to even use the app. I literally hate it!!!!!"
"October 14, 2015","Dependable. Delivers what I need. Classical longer pieces don't exist, though."
"May 22, 2016","I love love love love love love love love love this app. Accept one thing:needs an update coming out?  Thanks for giving me music that I can listen to anytime!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍"
"November 1, 2016","Great app"
"November 3, 2017","Didn’t order"
"May 27, 2017","Easy to use and great music choices."
"March 22, 2017","Still too many ads"
"November 3, 2016","All that I expected."
"September 7, 2013","Had used Pandora on my PC for several years. When I got my Kindle Fire & saw the Pandora app available I downloaded it. I had no problem playing it for a couple hours after downloading it. However when I tried to close the program nothing worked except a hard shutdown. When I tried to restart program nothing worked. Very, very disappointed!! Other programs on Kindle worked. Everything BUT Pandora...what's up?"
"May 27, 2013","I've been taking my Kindle into the kitchen when I preparing meals and doing dishes. Nice to enjoy music while I work but it seems to cut out and there is a lot of dead air space."
"June 10, 2014","Love to have music of my style at my fingertips anywhere around my house. This is a great app.!!! Highly recommend it."
"May 25, 2015","I love it you can listen to any music you want andbits fast and easy but the one thing I hate about it is that you have to have wifi and I have wifi at my grandma's but not at m yt? Houde so when I need it most I cant use it I wish they would make a version of it without using wifi thnk!!!!😁😁😁"
"February 16, 2014","Too many lock ups and advertisements. Id be listening while on the treadmill and it would just go silent for long periods of time."
"September 1, 2017","LOVE MY PANDORA! It's intuitive, got a fantastic selection and always work."
"August 18, 2017","I am a senior,when I trouble sleeping,I use the earphones and before you know I am ready to go to sleep,when need something to go to memory lane "" my youth"" l play the songs from my time and just relax ,l love having Pandora."
"May 23, 2017","Great app and very easy to use."
"August 17, 2016","Love it!"
"December 29, 2013","I have loved Pandora for the last 5 years. This software/app seems to be doing great. I'm new to Amazon products & have previously used Apple products & the PC desktop icon for Pandora. I'm a Pandora One user(annual small fee, no commercials, better feed...) great re: creating own channels & auto customization based on what you like, don't like."
"December 19, 2013","Pandora is like radio my way. Almost as good as an ipod. I wonder why they chose this name, you know with that box and everything that came with it. That name should have been saved for something bad."
"May 20, 2017","Amazing app, better than Spotify"
"July 28, 2016","music is my life.I l-o-v-e music sooo much.it has every music in the world.you HAVE to get this app.you and I love music."
"May 5, 2017","good product"
"February 17, 2016","I love Pandora! I listen to comedy in the morning, dance while I'm cleaning house. The variety is great and I get to try out new artists and genre for free. Keep up the good work!"
"August 17, 2015","5 STARZ"
"November 1, 2017","The ads are the worst. It's difficult to delete the stations."
"January 31, 2017","Can customize who you want to listen to by giving thumbs up or down. It's free! Would like the lyrics to more songs."
"December 5, 2016","Pandora always has such a good selection of artist and their music. Whoever does not have this app should get it, you will be very pleased."
"July 3, 2016","love the music"
"May 16, 2017","Love the music"
"December 28, 2012","It is so handy and generally good that I wonder what I did before this was around. I less frequently listen to my recorded music now. The items I would suggest be added are less of a criticism than ways to improve the service. Of course one limitation is that not all past and present music is included in their library. That is a major issue and one I know the folks at Pandora are constantly trying to mitigate by signing new contracts. Cache would be nice, on par with Slacker. Other than that I think they are doing things right and will be around for a very long time."
"April 25, 2014","Pandora is fabulous for anyone who loves music. The novel idea is that we control every piece we hear. By choosing the artist, or title of the piece we enjoy, (or group of artists) - we are then gifted with our choices and also other pieces in the same genre. Additionally we can choose to shuffle through our entire list or stay with one choice, whatever our mood. I would encourage everyone to experience this for themselves. Best of all it's free."
"October 19, 2016","I love Pandora radio!"
"August 15, 2013","I was introduced to Pandora by a friend and fell in love with it. I constantly listened to music on it. then one day I was cleaning my room and had been listening for a while then an artist that I do NOT like came on I tried to dislike it but the song continuedbto to play so I tried to skip it but I had already used the 6 skips in one hour the app is a great idea yet very expenseive and sucks battery I would have made this a five star review yet I just couldn't because if all the troubles I've had with this app."
"June 25, 2017","Awesome"
"August 25, 2017","excellent app"
"October 4, 2012","One of the greatest apps around. I have the paid version and love it. I use it on my Kindle Fire, my iPhone, computers, T.V. and my blu-ray DVD player. Works great and provides just the music I want, easy to set up, create stations, and use."
"January 29, 2013","It works great on my Droid. I love that it will play my favorite artist and then suggest other artists that have a similar sound. I have been able to find new artists that I love using this."
"January 30, 2017","I liked the way were you can listen to any radio you want"
"November 15, 2016","Very enjoyable! !"
"August 9, 2016","Fair"
"November 18, 2016","love it"
"July 18, 2016","Good App"
"August 8, 2014","The more I express my likes and dislikes on each of my stations the better become the selections Pandora picks for me. I love that I can listen to it anytime on my phone: working in the garden, walking in the morning, going shopping, etc. I highly recommend it. It's easy. Even a 69 year old grandma can set it up!"
"August 14, 2016","My stations are available where ever I go! I have a quiet instrumental station for my classroom, oldies for me, mariachi for taco night, Neil Diamond for my heart, praise and worship for my spirit, Raffi for sing alongs...LOVE PANDORA!"
"April 28, 2014","Pandora is the most anti-consumer, anti-artist radio service the world has ever known. Here are a few highlights you can expect with your Pandora player:  1. very few songs played over and over and over and over again 2. only run the player on one device at a time 3. extremely expensive for what you get - spend the $36 a year on 36 single downloads and you'll have more variety and better quality.  DON'T USE PANDORA!"
"June 27, 2017","I love it. I tried spotify. Sticking with pandora"
"October 25, 2015","I have listened to Pandora for years and enjoyed the music. Recently, however, it appears that the listener is being pushed away from free listening toward the premium pay listening. I receive about 80% of a song before Pandora switches to another song. Very annoying. I am switching to another alternative."
"December 22, 2016","The best radio on the internet."
"November 17, 2014","I really like Pandora and I listen to it daily when I am at work. I can have every genre of music that I enjoy and it is very relaxing and helps me stay focused. When I can get away with it, I choose Pandora over television so when I am alone in the house, you will find Pandora playing at my home as well. It is my station of choice."
"July 15, 2017","its amazing"
"October 23, 2016","It's just great"
"October 14, 2013","Pandora creates ""stations"" of music similar to any artist you submit. ""Peter Gabriel"" for instance will create a station of music by that artist and others Pandora deems similar such as Pink Floyd and Sting. This can be a good way to discover music you like but might not have heard yet. It is well worth paying the upcharge for Premium service to get rid of the commercials."
"February 12, 2015","I don't use it any more but it is free music"
"June 6, 2014","When I first got this app I was happy with it. I had all the stations I wanted and it was easy to navigate. Then after about three months it came up with a update that required you to have sign in. I tried it, it worked, I got in and was happy. Then the next day I tried to sign in with the same password and sign in but it said there was a sign in all ready existing to that password."
"May 14, 2015","I am extremely unhappy with your inclusion of Facebook on your website. While I have an existing accout with them, I like to have the choice as to whether or not I include them in my day to day life. If you are going to mine my data, at least be subtle about it.This will cause me to use your product less, rather than more. Thank You, Karl Kunkel"
"February 18, 2014","Pandora one is awesome. I recommend it to anyone too lazy or without the time to download music. It's efficient and convenient."
"May 24, 2017","Wonderful tangos I love it"
"October 1, 2017","great service and great music check out jw.org"
"June 29, 2014","I love music and Pandora provides me with music that I like. It also exposes me to music that I've never heard before which turns me on to musicians and bands that I wouldn't ordinary hear that I end up liking. It provides an avenue that I can somewhat steer towards the music that appeals to me. I listen to Pandora on a daily basis and have for a few years now. 5 thumbs up for Pandora! Thanks!"
"February 24, 2013","I love the freedom to setup my radio with a wide variety of music genres. We got the subscription service so, all music-no ads. We use our radios, phones, mac and PCs, we love Pandora."
"June 30, 2013","It's popular but only streams at 192kbps. Mog and Spotify have it beat by le a long margin by streaming at 320kbps. There is a noticeable difference in sound quality."
"November 25, 2013","I love Pandora on my PC home and office and now love the Pandora App on my phone. No need to buy music when you can get it all for free."
"May 7, 2014","She goes everywhere with me such as to the gym, shopping, and walking the dog. I love her style; in fact she has many! So far I've listed over 15 different ""styles"" and use her ""shuffle"" feature so that I'm never bored with the same tract line-up. Pandora is easy to customize and user-friendly, especially for this techno-challenged user. Kudos to Pandora's creators!"
"September 26, 2015","I enjoy listening but I've looked around after ""liking"" quite a few songs I can't figure out how to make my own station. I suspect that is a pay for service. I don't listen to music on my devices because of battery like."
"September 13, 2015","Downloaded and installed quickly and easily on my Kindle Fire. Already use Pandora on my PC and smart Blue Ray players, so I already have an account and personalized stations set up. Pandora is a real pleasure to listen to. With a decent pair of headphones on the Kindle Fire, the sound is excellent."
"January 14, 2014","WOW! I'm impressed! It took me a couple of tries to find my genre because I guess I like a lot of them But once I typed in ""pop rock"" the first song to pop up was my favorite song in The whole wide world. The second was I song I loved but couldn't figure out the Name. The only thing I have to criticize is that there are a lot of pop up ads but you can Fix that by upgrading but it costs money. GO PANDORA!"
"November 3, 2014","We absolutely love listening to Pandora. We can set up our own listening likes tabs and enjoy the music. The app is on our TV and I turn on Pandora and get wonderful music to listen to that plays throughout the house. I highly recommend this to everyone who likes listening to music."
"August 27, 2017","lkjhgfd"
"November 28, 2012","Love Pandora! Have it on everything that can have it lol. The sound quality is great on my kindle fire hd. I love all the features and don't mind a commercial for 30 seconds every now and then!"
"April 3, 2016","Pandora is great,but it does not give me free downloads.so I got Amazon prime for 100$ a year, now I get unlimited streaming for music movies games books tv shows,yes prime is awesome."
"October 4, 2013","We have instances of this service running on iPad, Android, Samsung Smart TV, and several Windows operating system computers. I'll put it on the nearest sound system quite frequently, and the most recent download, the one for my Samsung Galaxy IV lets me plug into the radio on my truck and play quite good audio on the go. So far, this has not made a big dent in my monthly allotment of gigabytes of download over Verizon, in part because most of the time I use it on devices attached to my home network either via Ethernet or wirelessly that are served by high speed cable based internet service."
"December 1, 2014","Besides the fact that they get you in then prod you to step up to paying they stream good music for the most part. New artists or seldom heard artists are appreciated when they get your taste in music down and I have a quite a diverse taste in music, the tunes roll in."
"October 27, 2015","This is a great app WHEN it's working. I keep getting the ""we are having technical difficulties"" almost every time I sign on. It's frustrating when I want to listen to music and can't. I'm almost to the point of deleting the app cause it stays down more than up."
"November 15, 2016","Good"
"November 7, 2015","I love pandora, it's one of the greatest inventions ever. I get my favorite music with exposure to new, similar artists. The only con is the adds are annoying with the free version but it's to be expected."
"June 16, 2016","This is the best music app"
"December 8, 2013","Easy Access to music I love! I'm amazed at what I can do with Pandora... still learning! on my phone..computer... I'll put more here after I've used it longer"
"May 19, 2017","We enjoy this app and it's versatility. We can program several ""Favorite"" stations and enjoy our music from several situations. With a remote Bluetooth speaker we listen at several locations----home, patio, with us on vacation and more."
"May 8, 2014","Amazing song app. It gives you free music to on the go! It works if your device is on or off with headphone or not!You can pic stations to add to your wonderful list. Every artist or track you love will be with you at all times!Some artist to search:Bridget Mendler,Kanye West,V.I.C Radio, and others!~Pandora supervisor"
"May 23, 2017","I have just started using Pandora and it's working fine. Need to learn more tips about using it."
"January 28, 2014","I don't have to pay for music anymore . Let . Me tell you . There's a audio recorder app that's for free on my kindle and you can record Pandora music then you can listen to it without WiFi or Pandora cause it immediately downloads on your device. I want to give it 10000000000,000000000000,00000000000,00,00,00,00,00,00,000,000,00,000,000,,,0000,00000 star's."
"December 27, 2013","I was excited to see that Pandora was available for my kindle hd after being an avid user on my pc. I have become very disappointed with this app because of a constant loading issue. It will work a couple of times then it won't load. I've deleted/downloaded this app so many times it's becoming a chore. Please fix this! Don't make me go back to iheart radio!"
"October 9, 2015","Pandora is Great! I love all the variety of music it has."
"February 19, 2013","I remember listening to Pandora and hearing an ad every 3 or 4 songs, now it seems as tho it's 2 songs, then an ad. If I JUST had an ad, skip a song, it has an ad again. Annoying, but, it's free. As for the songs, I'm a fan of Industrial music and it seems as tho Pandora only plays songs by 6 or 7 different bands. I KNOW there are more Industrial bands out there! It serves it's purpose, it keeps my niece dancing on bad days, but the amount of ads is getting insane. It isn't driving me to upgrade, it's driving me to find another service."
"September 4, 2017","Pandora is a good product, but in order to get the best quality, you must pay for use."
"October 27, 2016","Love it!!!"
"February 24, 2014","I loved Pandora when I first got it several years ago. It was easy to use and I loved the variety but then it disappeared and I couldn't get it back. I tried the help line but it did not work. Recently I got a Kindle Fire and tried to connect with Pandora. They still had my email but I couldn't remember my password (its been at least a year) and thought I clicked on ""forgot my password"" I haven't heard back. I'II"
"February 7, 2014","Pandora is a joy to use and an incredible value for free (with ads) or for a small monthly fee (ad-free). I love that I can create multiple ""stations"", specify a few artists to ""focus"" the programming, and just sit back and enjoy the surprising and almost always spot-on results. A refreshing change from my downloaded albums, annoying commercial radio, and horribly repetitive satellite broadcast options. Love Pandora! Thank you. Pandora."
"April 6, 2015","I have Pandora on my laptop and my TV and truly enjoy listening to the genres of music that I select directly and indirectly on my ""stations."" I recommended the program (app, etc) to family and friends this week. It is a great way to check out new music and artists you have not heard."
"February 3, 2016","I love Pandora asks have it on all my devices. Recently it just won't play on kindle. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and the troubleshooting tips they suggest. Nothing works. Not sure if it's the app or its comparability with kindle fire so one star rating for now."
"November 22, 2016","It's the best, have on all my devices, 6 plus Roku TV, Thank you"
"November 3, 2017","Very good, you choose what you want to listen and very little commercial like it"
"December 6, 2012","You should have pandora on all of your devices. You never know when you will feel like certain tunes. I love listening to holiday music to get in the Christmas spirit and I love listening to spa music to relax. love variety."
"February 9, 2014","I upgraded to Pandora|One and I absolutely love it!!! Being able to choose both genre and style of music I want to listen to; and choosing songs that I don't want to hear again, is absolutely fantastic! It is well worth the monthly subscription fee, and not nearly as expensive as other internet radio options. I highly recommend this to any and all music lovers! You won't be disappointed!!!"
"September 13, 2017","I have to have WiFi in order to use it so I've yet to be able to use it all . Not even in my car and the car came with it !"
"April 12, 2015","I really like Pandora as you can find a station based on your artist. If you give the thumbs up for songs, they tend to play them and others like it more often. The commercials are fine and not very long so they aren't really a problem. I like that you can also purchase a song that is on as well right from the app. Would definitely recommend it."
"October 7, 2015","Link via iPhone or Kindle Fire. Sometimes a lengthy pause between selections but that is probably the Time Warner internet connection. Fidelity is enhanced by linking iPhone or Kindle Fire via a Bluetooth speaker. Comparable to Prime Music although Prime Music is better in that I can access my playlists"
"November 3, 2017","Listening to Pandora is awesome. Just wanna get in the groove. Better than drugs."
"February 12, 2017","I think it is cool and it helps people go to sleepand it cool for people at Eng age and for tron people for partys"
"April 29, 2016","Would give it a better review, but unfortunately 2 stars is about all it deserves right now. Almost every time I try to log in I'm told ""We're experiencing technical difficulties"". Once that's fixed would have no problem giving it 4/5 stars."
"May 17, 2015","Great music app."
"May 9, 2013","I love that I can ""create"" a radio station to MY taste in music, and not have to listen to a lot of the bull pucky crap they call music nowadays. GREAT app"
"January 24, 2014","love all the music, the artist, and such on this app! you can listen to pretty much anything you want! love it"
"August 20, 2017","I love it and listen to it everyday. You can pick and get all your favorites all the time! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"
"October 29, 2015","I have a couple of stations created off of some of my favorite artists. EVERY song on there is incredible - takes me back many years and I can listen to it endlessly. Quality of the songs is excellent, and when compared to other music streaming apps such as Slacker Radio, Pandora is without peer."
"June 9, 2014","I love Pandora and have been using it for years on my laptop and iPhone. It's best feature for me is the ease of accessing such a wide variety of music from every era and from many artists sometimes new ones that I have not been familiar with. It is easy to use and was easy even when I was a new computer user many years ago. It updates with new features on a regular basis and the updates are always value added without big format changes."
"January 4, 2015","Haven't used it very much yet; but, like it very much."
"March 1, 2014","I love Pandora bcause i can lesson to all my oldies without having to change CDs. Pandora play all the oldies that i have'nt heard in along time.I lesson to Pandora on my walk with the dog, or when i go shopping or cleaning the house, the music motivates me,all-in-all I LOVE PANDORA. I rather lesson to Pandora than the radio. Thank you Pandora One.I would tell or text all my FB family n friends about Pandora One."
"August 1, 2013","Best app on the market for all things music. Great place to listen to the oldies, funkie, rap to pop. Highly recommend for anyone who has a tablet, smartphone, laptop and even desktops."
"December 9, 2016","I love pandora and use it all the time but they need a larger variety of music on each station. I know exactly what songs I am going to hear any time I go in."
"April 9, 2015","Having your favorite tunes organized in the palm of your hands whenever you want it is just plain awesome! I have my work out tunes, my relaxation massage music, my driving music and dinner music all organized. Love it! And the price is right! I was very disappointed when my other phone could not get Pandora! I'm glad I have it on my phone again!"
"February 17, 2017","It does not work. I tried to send an email stating this and could not get it to work also. Please help me."
"September 7, 2013","It took a while for it to first start up but the app is working fine now, easy to navigate and of course; still the only downside are the ads, but that's because I'm too cheap to get the paid version. XP"
"January 12, 2014","Love Pandora! It let's me create my own music stations, jazz one minute Christian music the next. And what's cool about it is if you ""like"" the song by pressing the thumbs up icon, the next time you choose that station they will play your favorites, so pretty much guaranteed to hear your favorites in that time frame.  I have the free standard version, and that's good enough for me, I don't mind the occasional short ads, I highly recommend!"
"October 19, 2017","didnot order this"
"June 7, 2017","Love it. Have it across all my devices."
"July 29, 2013","I selected ""Pokey LaFarge"" and that was the artist first played. But since then I get only music similar in style. Also, had to go to ""contact"" to get password fix and it took two tries."
"September 24, 2014","Free unlimited music of your chose. Great for any mood any occasion any time any day. The perfect music app for music lovers"
"December 19, 2013","works great on the Kindle, on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and on my computer at work. I love being able to make my own stations."
"April 10, 2015","it would be way better without commercials, and no I'm not willing to pay for that privilege."
"November 21, 2016","Wonderful, wonderful station. Thank you and God bless"
"December 18, 2015","Love it wish it was able to play offline."
"November 20, 2015","So got this app a week ago and sarted it up and everything seemed to work as expected except that the music would not play and I couldn't pause or skip...very disappointed please fix! Would like to enjoy on my kindle."
"March 18, 2015","never tried it, wouldn't know"
"October 8, 2017","great entertainment"
"January 11, 2017","I listen to Pandora all day when I am home."
"May 14, 2015","Works well on data."
"January 9, 2017","I love listening to Pandora - I always hear many of my favorite songs on a variety of Channels! Such an awesome app!"
"September 7, 2013","I got the free version of Pandora and am loving this Pandora music experience, I listen to music via Pandora rather than the radio now because it is able to select music that I like. I can give it thumbs up or thumbs down to each music and Pandora will remember my preference."
"July 21, 2014","l like this app because it provides all my old school rock and heavy metal. You can create your own stations on any music you like and publish them for the community. What I really like is you get a bio about the artists you choose to hear. And it's really interesting on how they were formed, played together and made history. Pandora will select the song for you based on the genre you select. Great App."
"January 13, 2014","Pandora has the largest collection of music on the web. I love how you can customize your stations and the service can adapt to your preferences. The commercials are short on the free service and not too obtrusive. I have had few technical problems and I use it on my computer, Kindle and cell phone. I have a BA in Musicology and I sincerely love this service as it reminds me of all the great music I studied in college."
"May 1, 2017","i wish you could download music for free so you can listen to it offline."
"November 22, 2015","I appreciate Pandora for providing a variety of music to enjoy while I work at the typewriter. Their addition of commercials takes away from the enjoyment. I take advantage of the free music. Probably, if I paid for it, the commercials would go away."
"December 4, 2013","this app is great. it runs smoothly and is just all out awesome. I deffinitly recommend Pandora one but buy that nonlinear ratherthen on your device. it only gives you the per month payment option when the per year option is a better deal. The one thing it needs is more ways to sort stations like by genre or have a favorites bar, or playlists. that is what would make it even better then now. I hope people can understand what I'm saying. anyways, that's it!!"
"August 6, 2012","I don't really mind there being ads but some of them are about sexual enhancement etc. I don't want to be seeing/hearing those certain ads with my family around. the worst part is those types of ads you get while the music is playing, you cant close them! the close button simply does not work and opens the link as if you'd clicked on the ad itself. I understand I'm using the free version of Pandora but there should be a way to disable those types of ads while still being able to listen to my favorite songs that have slight profanity in them. other than that, good app."
"February 6, 2015","Sometimes this shows you bands/music you've never given a chance. Turns you onto new stuff while listening"
"January 23, 2014","I use and like Pandora and am a paid subscriber; really like accessing it on the Fire and plugging into external powered speakers or my hi-fi. Initially I found this app to be annoyingly unstable: If I tried to log into my Pandora account when first turning on the Fire, I could usually get in but sometimes it timed out before I could complete the login process or I'd get a message telling me they're experiencing problems. Anyway, there must have been an update at some point because the app has been trouble free for quite a while now and I really like it. I particularly like that there's a ""quit"" option when I want to stop it, as opposed to completely logging out. After using the ""quit"" option, when I want to get back in all I have to do is select Pandora from the Fire carousel and the app launches with no need to sign in. The alarm clock function is probably my favorite thing; very cool to wake to your own programmed music channel. Good stuff!"
"February 3, 2016","Love the options to choose from. I was mainly looking for some relaxtion music & was surprized to find the different type of music out there to choose from. I love it!"
"July 27, 2017","I love this app this may not be helpful but I do not care bye : ) !!!!!!!"
"December 20, 2013","App downloaded quickly and easily with authentic Pandora screen. I could comfortably navigate the site as I would through my PC."
"August 20, 2014","I love this free version. Although, it may become worth it to get the monthly subscription so I don't have to listen to the ads."
"May 20, 2014","Switch to Spotify! You can download fave songs to listen while on the road/etc. without burning up data!! Internet radio is also an option and it is more interactive, ex. gives suggestions for different stations, singers, etc. in a fun visual way rather than boring old commercials. You have to upgrade to premium to download the songs but it is worth it!"
"January 30, 2013","........that you have no control over. If you like Rock, Country, Electronica, Pop, etc, you pick the category and the songs begin to play. You cannot tell the app what songs you would like to hear. In other words, this works just like radio stations that plays genres of music that you like. You may not like the song that is currently playing, so you can switch to another station or just wait for the song to end and hope the next tune is something you like."
"June 22, 2015","Goodl"
"January 6, 2016","This app freezes up if we add a new station. Then when I reinstall it, it freezes up after playing one song. I have reinstalled the program four times in one day. It works fine on my ipad, but not on my Kindle fire. Is it me or a problem with the app and the Kindle?"
"August 20, 2013","I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to set up a station with my favorite artists! I am a country fan and while I enjoy all the different artists, I have ones that I really love and Pandora allows me to listen to them more often. I haven't explored all the options but am enjoying learning and listening. Thank you!"
"May 22, 2016","Couldn't get it to work on my new Kindle Fire. I really like Pandora and the amount of music you can listen to, but I'd be better off using my computer or phone t use it."
"November 14, 2013","I get exactly the music I want with Pandora's ability for the user to choose their own ""stations"" and listen to their favorites, as well as the regular broadcasts."
"May 2, 2014","I started listening to Pandora years ago and they would not only play the songs by the artists I picked, they would point me to artists I had never even heard of which led me to buy their music and thus expand my music collection. I will keep on listening and hopefully hear about even more artists whose music needs to be heard."
"May 11, 2016","I always had an Pandora account & I recently went back to it. It's like the songs that come on they instantly know what I like to listen to. GREAT APP!!!"
"April 28, 2017","I don't care for Pandora for this reason; You create a station with an artist. I thought I would only be listening to that particular artist. Unfortunately, Pandora takes it upon themselves to add other artists that they consider to be of the same genre. I am passionate about my music and I resent having a computer tell me what to listen to. For instance, I may want to listen to Bob Dylan only, there are a few Dylan songs and then suddenly I'm listening to Bruce Springsteen. Can't stand that. I would like to pick my own music which is why I stick with ITunes."
"September 20, 2015","When I downloaded this app, I thought it would be fun. But everytime is says I have to make an account to listen, it will not let me. And I have tried this every day for the past two months. So I deleted this app."
"January 7, 2015","My only wish is that I could turn it on and leave it on all day instead of having it cut out and wait for me to notice."
"September 3, 2016","i love pandora being able to listen to all of my favorite artist its awesome. i dont like how oi have to listen to the same commercials everytime i hear an advertisement its the same one over and over again"
"January 13, 2013","I love pandora for it's innovative and versatile service's they provide in their program. I love being able to create my own station's, music I want to hear the music I grew up on. Thank's Pandora, Your Awesome..."
"January 9, 2014","This app is designed for the true music lover. Works very well on Kindle Fire and is easy to set up. You program the music you want by artist and Pandora takes it from there by providing that artist as well as like-sounding artist. So you can discover other interesting artists you may not be familiar with or have heard their latest music."
"March 28, 2015","Pandora is such a pleasure for anyone to enjoy. It doesn't matter what type of music you or I enjoy because it's available for our enjoyment. From easy listening for me to what ever is your choice, it's always available. What more could you ask."
"September 18, 2017","We absolutely love Pandora. It is great while reading, talking in the living room with family and friends and just to relax. A good tension reliever. Oh yes, enjoyable music with good choices of performers."
"April 28, 2016","Love"
"September 26, 2017","Easy selection, decent collection. I would like some more songs because occasionally there is repetition."
"December 31, 2012","Pandora, choose your station. Customize the station. buy the music. share the song with a link. the lyrics can even be looked at on some songs. don't like the song, thumbs down. or you can move the song to somewhere else. i like the commercials. i have the free pandora. any station, clean, explicit. doesn't matter and pandora tells you if you are listening to the clean version of any song.  music and comedy. something for every age. must have. i have this on my kindle fire. i find that this works very well indeed."
"November 16, 2014","This is a very good app. I can listen to ridiculous music like the Goofy Goober Song, to real music you'd hear on the radio, to music from the Harry Potter movies! The only problem is if I use it while playing Minecraft, my Kindle either shuts down or glitches badly."
"March 16, 2013","I have gotten many apps for my kindle and my ipod touch but, I have never found an app that I enjoy as much as I enjoy Pandora!! I go and pick the music I want and just sit and listen to my hearts content. Thank you so much for this app. I have my own radio stations and no commercials to interrupt my music. A must for everyone on every computer, kindle, tablet, phone etc. Can't say enough."
"December 29, 2014","Absolutely awesome, I lke almost all generes of music, but the blues are my favorite. Recently I heard of this site from my son, I'm like a kid with a new toy. Thank you so much, for having set this up for those that have a common love of music. Keep the ""great work "" Mark D. NY..."
"October 29, 2014","I can't believe they let me download this app when it isn't even available in the UK. As soon as I opened it it has a warnine screen saying it is not available in the UK. And I LOVE Pandora don't get me wrong. But it was a big letdown after getting my hopes up that I would finally be able to get Pandora in the UK. Total bummer."
"December 27, 2014","Utterly incredible I can get all the music in all the genres for free. How come now one ever told me this before.. no more messing around with iTunes or cranky ipod down load... its on my computer and even better on my kindle. Easy app to get.. did nor need SS#, blood type name of first grade teacher or prom date top get... Stunning, amazing, I love it"
"May 19, 2014","I love Pandora and how you can create your own stations and a million different kinds. The only thing I wish you could also select would be soundtracks. There are so many soundtracks I'd love to listen too, even if there were similar soundtracks thrown in. A little trickier than a genre or artist but not impossible.  No complaints otherwise."
"February 19, 2017","I really enjoy Pandora, daily, with all my favorite radio stations. I love the Shuffle feature! My biggest complaint is that it pops on at any time without clicking on it. This problem only happens on my Kindle Fire HD 8, which I have to Shut Down when I leave because Pandora may come on and use up all the battery. I do not sign out to end the music, only ""Quit"" because it's very difficult to sign in. I don't know if this is a Pandora problem or a Kindle problem. Update 4-16-17: After the recent Pandora update, this problem has finally been fixed! Much improvement with this last update, too."
"April 9, 2015","So many music apps out there but Pandora is far the best!!!"
"April 19, 2014","It would be nice if you could pick your specific song list like grooveshark but it's still an AWESOME alternative to commercial radio!"
"November 30, 2012","Pandora has a great selection of music that can be listened to anywhere. It also allows you to create your own stations and then scramble them to get a wide variety of music."
"August 23, 2017","Great!!"
"December 4, 2016","I truly appreciate and enjoy listening to Pandora. Please keep it free radio. My love goes to the crew. Thank you! bjs"
"November 19, 2011","I've been reading waaay too many whines from kids who don't like the commercials. THERE'S AN ANSWER, CHEAPOS. Pay a piddling amount for a year of commercial-free Pandora and help the company stay afloat. You'll also get a great-quality stream. The only reason that Slacker may hags fewer ads is that (a) they can't find the advertisers and (b) they haven't burned through their capital yet. Meanwhile, NOBODY beats Pandora's Music Genome algorhythm at sussing out new music you'll love. They're easily best in breed. FIVE STARS. Try it and if you love it but hate the ads, pay the piper. You won't be sorry."
"May 16, 2016","I like how is personalizes the stations, and I love thumbprint station, but I hate how it limits skips and dislikes one the free version. Also the adds are annoying."
"December 11, 2016","Love Pandora!! Can listen to my music on any device and in even in my car or on TV with DirectTV!"
"May 8, 2017","I can listen to the music I like. I like to listen to music when I am heading to work. I just put on my headphones and listen to something relaxing."
"October 3, 2017","Love it!"
"December 18, 2016","A real treasure. Wonderful selections that set the mood and allow the listener to get lost in the music."
"November 9, 2017","my favorite way to listen to music now."
"May 19, 2016","I truly enjoy the hands off approach to music. I am a musician and love the selection of tracks, especially those from bands I have never heard before. great idea, keep up the great work."
"October 22, 2014","Pandora is the best thing since sliced bread. Being able to customize my music choices is fabulous. No bummer music. No out-of-sync songs with my listening mood. My musical tastes are wide ranging but I hold high standards when it comes to listening to any genre. Pandora provides a way to get the best of the best. Gotta love that!"
"December 27, 2014","Not familiar enough with the phone yet, but 1. would like it's own app instead of going thru amazon app, 2. too many ad's, 3. too many suggested 'other' music I might like, 4. choosing other songs by an artist vs. just what they want to highlight, 5. Music does not stop when I turn off my phone, and 6. not easy or friendly or simple to navigate around the Amazon/Pandora app."
"February 28, 2014","You can't complain about the price, but I would like it so much better if you didn't choose other artists for me, or if you would at least allow me to weed them out. The best I can do is drop 1 song at a time, and that just isn't adequate. Most of the music you offer, however, is really great, so I gave you the 4 stars. Thank you."
"January 4, 2013","I just recently purchased the Pandora app since I have a Pandora account that I have been using on traditional computers. Pandora will continue to play in the background even if the app is not open and you are working on other things. In addition, I started to watch a movie trailer while Pandora was playing. Pandora actually muted itself while the trailer was playing and picked back up right when the trailer was over. I didn't have to do anything! What a smart and convenient app!"
"August 21, 2017","Ok"
"April 5, 2017","Great music!!"
"February 10, 2017","I really love it. I got Pandora for my husband and he is very happy with the music that he selected."
"July 10, 2013","Thought it was free music? Not. I guess nothing much is free (apps)on the Kindle fire, but I'll deal with it."
"May 17, 2017","I'm using it, but I don't know how."
"June 12, 2015","Pandora does not work any more on my Android phone. I used their service for about 6 months then it stopped working. I contacted them and they are unable to figure-out what is wrong. I am cancelling my service and going with another provider."
"February 16, 2014","I had Pandora on my Ipod but when I went to put it on my kindle it asked for my password. I wasn't sure if I had had a separate pass word for Pandora. Was it my password for Amazon? This was confusing so they did not load it onto my kindle however they seem to think it is on. I am not sure how to go about getting it now. I do like Pandora on my Ipod"
"October 13, 2012","I always have and always will love the services Pandora provides. I get to listen to newer songs by the artists I adore and never have to pay a penny for it(unless I cannot live without the song in question)! And the way Pandora is set up for my Kindle Fire HD is far superior to the application on my iTouch. This version hardly ever freezes and does not deliver choppy music. I think there are far less bugs in this version. So, in short, great product that I use daily."
"January 10, 2014","I enjoy using Pandora and I encourage everyone to down load this for free app for the inter net ENJOY!"
"June 11, 2017","A convenient and pleasant source with or without ads."
"February 6, 2014","My husband has thousands of songs in his library. This allows me to customize the music I like and find like artists I might enjoy. Having a ball using Pandora."
"July 5, 2017","Pandora is life 😍😍😍💕can't say enough !!"
"July 18, 2017","Still listening? costs a star, could be longer between the question pops up again. Don't mind the commercials."
"September 9, 2012","Pandora is honestly really great. I've literally been using it for a solid 6 months straight, it's that good. And I don't get these reviews saying that commercials interrupt the songs, cuz they don't. You'll get like one commercial every 3 or 4 songs with little pop up ads. while listening. And since my kindle's on lock most of the time when I'm listening, or since I'm doing other things like playing games or on the web, it doesn't matter cuz I cant see the ads. I like this app a whole lot, and ill probably be a loyal fan for years."
"January 7, 2012","this app does its job: delivers the Pandora experience on kindle fire. free tunes customized the say you like without having to micromanage your playlist. i sympathize with other commenters who complain about the ads, but I really cant get upset about that for free music. would be nice to have greater variety in them so I didn't hear the same REI ad twenty times an hour. one issue... every few songs, it has a tendency to pause for a couple seconds in silence, as though the buffer hasn't caught up. hopefully they'll fix this with an update. but for this, would give five stars."
"September 8, 2015","This app is so amazing I would recommend it to everyone free music and it's just amazing."
"December 3, 2015","I love being able to customize my music. Pandora is very easy to use, and you can skip a song if your not sure you want it or not at the time it first plays. Makes for great variety on road trips"
"August 22, 2017","Love how you can add to or create a channel to fit your preferences."
"September 27, 2017","Glad I could put it on my Kindle"
"December 27, 2013","So I downloaded the app on my new phone, happy because my sister had it on her phone. So I clicked on ""make an acount"" and I put in all the information that I needed and clicked ""make acount"" a second later a message popes up saying ""thank you! But sadly we can not accept your a application at this time"" I've tried over and over again but it still happens ever time!"
"June 2, 2016","greatest music selection available."
"January 8, 2016","I love this app and would love it more. But lately it won't play any station on my tablet regardless of the upgrades or not... I use the lullaby stations to help my son sleep at night plz fix"
"September 18, 2017","Better than listening to the TV."
"March 25, 2014","I just don't understand how it works and how to make it work for me. The preset selections seem to be good enough."
"May 23, 2013","it keeps coming on by itself and I am not sure why. The song choices are not aways my favorite. I wish I had more control of that but it is nice to have music i don't have to buy."
"January 13, 2015","Difficult changing stations."
"September 18, 2017","Pandora is Great! I have the free plan and I can choose the type of music I like and listen for as long as I want absolutely free. It's wonderful!"
"November 4, 2014","Good selection of music. Not always easy to see how it works on other devices, but very easy on my Kindle."
"October 9, 2015","Wow, what a nice free service!! I can't believe I just discovered this thanks to my son!! I love the music and can change it, give thumbs up and thumbs down to the ones I wish! This is the next best thing to the invention of the remote! Love, love it!!!!"
"June 7, 2016","I just enjoy the convenience of it. I can also leave it on while I'm away from the house for a few hours - it's nice to hear music in the house when I come home."
"September 18, 2017","Bad connection..keep losing the connection..continuous buffering"
"June 20, 2014","This app provided me with a source of peace. I just set a time limit and zone out on the sofa. I love switching in between my selected genres without having to worry about being stuck with an unpleasant song. I can either skip it or dislike it. It is also great for when I'm doing other stuff. I just turn it on and put it off to the side whilst I work. I thoroughly enjoy this app."
"March 24, 2013","Excellent ap. I can play the music I like and thumbs down the ones I don't. Can't say anything negative about it. The ads are sometimes a pain, but for a free ap, what do you expect? I recommend it to my friends."
"January 13, 2015","Great product and service"
"August 29, 2015","It's good to have all my old favorites to listen to. I have been a listener for a few years now. The only negative to Pandora is it seems to mix stations with other favorite channels. Such as the B52's and Jethro Tull on the same channel."
"September 12, 2017","Fabulous as always. So thankful to have an awesome music app for my Kindle. I have Pandora on every device in my house."
"August 8, 2017","Easier to use and the playlists I can actually listened to from beginning to the end"
"September 25, 2012","There's a lot of reviews saying that this Pandora app has some issues, but I personally have found absolutely none (Fix your device?)  This app allows you to listen to music that resembles a song or artist, and often the artist itself, with a few commercials between songs.  Sometimes I might get a completely random artist, but those can be 'banned' on the station, unfortunately you can't be rid of an entire artist, only a song.  From what I've experienced, this is an app that must be had."
"July 18, 2017","Grsat choice of music"
"January 4, 2014","the pop up advertisements, I feel like I am using NetZero from back around the turn of the Millennium. I understand that if you pay for a subscription that those pop ups go away, but in this day and age people need to save $$$ any way they can, so why pay for something when you can keep the free version and just tap the pop ups away every single time they come up."
"August 29, 2017","Excelente"
"December 9, 2015","Pandora needs a back button!"
"January 2, 2013","I have this on my both my internet TV and my tablet. The music choices usually (but not always) stay true to the type of music played by the original artist you've chosen. Surprised, though, that there is no choice for Beethoven or some of the other Classical greats, but it may be that my search capabilities aren't that great when searching for artists and music. Even so, it's a great way to add the kind of music you like."
"April 22, 2015","I love this app, I love that you can change channels and search for channels that is great because you can listen to different artists and music. On the down side you have to pay for add free listening but sometimes the adds aren't even bothering. Overall it is a great app and I recommend it."
"October 10, 2017","Best music app by far! The genres, options and settings are plenty! Easy navigation and almost always plays the music I actually like!"
"December 7, 2014","I love Pandora but... it keeps playing songs that don't even relate to me station I'm listening to! So I'm listening to Imagine Dragons raised and I hear Taylor Swift or Paul Cardall!!!! And it only lets me skip songs 5-6 Times an hour on each station!!! This is why I u, Pandora a 3-5!"
"June 21, 2017","This app is awsone, it keeps track of your favorite music. Thumbprint is awesome and I also injoy shuffle. Been listening to Pandora for over 5 years now."
"December 26, 2012","I like that it lets me add several artists to one station so that it gets a better idea of what to suggest. I don't like that in the beginning while you are ""teaching"" it what you like, you can only fast forward so many times. And even though you can't go back and listen to a specific artist/album like in Spotify, it's suggestions are still much, much better. So if I want something possible new mixed in with what I like I use Pandora."
"December 15, 2013","I listened for hours several days this week to the Christmas station, hearing wonderful songs, with some suggestions from me, while wrapping gifts and sitting by the fire. I love Pandora's varied choices for me. I am never bored, I often sing along, and if one they choose is not right for my mood at the moment, I can delete it and get another one immediately. The ads are few. And finally, its free! What's not to like?"
"February 2, 2014","I love this app! After you've made a couple stations and have thumb-upped or thumb-downed a bunch of songs, you can just put it on shuffle (which I love) and just relax and listen to music. What I also love about this app is that you can go to your home screen and play games and still listen to music! Which is why it has a 5 star rating from me. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes music!"
"October 13, 2017","Needs the replay function added like the iOS version has. Other wise it’s as good as the iOS app"
"May 29, 2017","keeps me company and I enjoy their library of entertainjment"
"June 30, 2013","I've used Google Play, Music 365, IHeart Radio and Pandora, and I have to give the overall nod to Pandora, even with the ads. If you're looking for stations that actually play the artists you want (assuming that they have a moderately substantial catalog of at least 30 songs to their credit), you have to use Pandora. The best streaming music service online, and it's free if you don't mind the occasional 15 second ad."
"July 27, 2016","Love the fact that I can select the type of music and it just keeps playing an assortment of the same type of music."
"May 14, 2014","When I first discovered Pandora I was ecstatic about being able to hear m favorite songs with nothing else interrupting it. Ony one week and I can't get to my favorites because they are always pushing crappy music into my phone that I can't get rid of unless I shut my phone off and start over."
"December 26, 2016","It was ""busy NOT AVAILABLE""?"
"December 3, 2014","Great app for fantastic music!!"
"February 27, 2013","The free appliction works great but a little crude for the Kindle, on the ipad it is fantastic.. I love it and bought a subscription to pandora."
"March 11, 2017","The best radio app ever made.😀😀😀😀😀 I listen to the music I love from the comfort of my own home.😜😜😜😜😜😜😜 Five stars.😎😎😎😎😎😎😎"
"October 11, 2014","Pandora has the best stations I've heard so far and their website is wonderful to navigate. You can collect albums and songs from your favorites and they even have stations that are created through your favorite song or artist. I have Pandora on Roku and enjoy it through my television, computer and Kindle. I love the music. Music choices seem endless and if you want commercial free and ad free music, the subscription price is amazingly low."
"December 14, 2015","Love Pandora!"
"May 28, 2015","I'm sorry but way too many adds.I just can't use it anymore.so I use spotify.I am actually listening to it while I review.and I can tell you there where no ads for a whopping 15 minutes.compared to Pandora that is such a big difference."
"June 7, 2014","I enjoy the unending possibilities of music. I can listen on my own time with my 'own' stations which I have created. I travel and love not being dependent on a sound system anywhere. It is an answer to television and I feel great for not just wasting time on 'dippy movies'. I can fill my mind with great music!"
"December 23, 2015","When I get on I hit register for free then I do what it tell me what to do then I hit sign in then it tells me. &#34;Thank you for your interest but unfortunately Pandora can't get to you"
"September 12, 2017","Love being to choose the genres and artists that I like to hear. Also like the ability to change song, if it's one I don't care for."
"December 10, 2013","Hey you, yes you! listen up! PANDORA IS A MUST HAVE. I literally live on Pandora. I play it no matter what I'm doing, it's on. You can personalize your station(s) by clicking the thumbs up. You can create stations by genre of music and the artist. For example, my favorite is Carrie Underwood radio. For any of those musics lover's out there; Get Pandora Now!!! It is amazing. I cant even say anything bad about it!!"
"November 16, 2016","It's on POINT!"
"November 25, 2013","This is a great service. I was slow to com to use this program. But this allows me to choose music I enjoy, especially right now, Christmas music. Curiously, this version has only occasional ads. The smart phone app is annoyingly riddled with ads--visual and voiced over. If I had first used that Pandora, I would never have loaded on my Kindle Fire. This is lovely and the ads are a minor annoyance."
"November 9, 2016","Love Pandora❤️ So many music selections."
"May 10, 2016","I tried numerous times to log in every time I put my birthday in and tried to insert the year it wouldn't let me scroll lower than 2002. Very frustrating"
"November 24, 2012","I Love it. Pandora plays any kind of music you want to hear. IT's great MY email Address is CTS0656@COMCAST.NET. Kim O'Connell is my daughter. I don't know what to say about Pandora except how good it is and how much i enjoy listen to all the music.Suzanne O'Connell"
"March 14, 2013","Sounds great playing on the Kindle Fire HD, I have used Pandora in the past on my lap top, or Pc."
"November 2, 2013","I started getting political (and other) advertisements that interrupted both my music and any games I was playing. I have not positively isolated the source of these ads. When I do that application will be deleted permanently and I may reload Pandora. I could not skip, stop, or delete these ads except by Shutting Down my Kindle. I am filing a complaint with AMAZON and KINDLE SUPPORT.   I have really liked listening to music on PANDORA that was from my school years. That is why I gave it two stars. However, I will NOT have any application that includes advertising that is this intrusive on my Kindle."
"August 21, 2017","Personally care for Pandora more than iHeartRadio. I seem to be the minority."
"July 18, 2017","I could get to listen to my favorite Christian station,songwriters and worship leaders.very inspirational and encouraging."
"February 28, 2017","I love this app,but I wish all the time with out a free trial we don't have to be online all the time .....but so far this app is great"
"February 16, 2014","-I am SarRev, I review all hot or interesting apps.-  Pandora is the best thing since sliced bread! Sometimes it plays songs we don't like or know, but, it is meant to introduce us to different songs and our likes. So sometimes that might no be so convenient for us, but, Pandora can't read our minds. This app works great, it plays (mostly) your favorite music, and I HIGHLY recommend it!"
"January 12, 2014","I find Pandora media service to be my most used app on my smartphone. I can listen to ""Classical Study"" while I read, do projects and study online or at my desk. I find it helpful that Pandora feeds me with so many different selections, I never get bored. It is like a radio station just for my style.  Sincerely, David Hall"
"June 8, 2013","You can listen to music for as long as you want! I use it all the time like right now I'm listening to over the rainbow ( love the song) I recommend that you get this app and it's free so if you don't like it you won't waste your coins or money. I recommend it to music fans. Pick any genera any song and it's there. If you don't believe me try it for yourself. ITS FREE!!!!!!!!"
"October 20, 2017","It's good but I wish it would stick on topic more is I put a artist I would like to hear more of that artist"
"October 29, 2011","I have been an avid user of Pandora on my PC for a while now, and I have been more than happy to add it to my recently purchased Galaxy S2. Easy interface and good sound quality. No sound brakes using T-Mobile's ""4G""."
"August 26, 2013","This is a great free radio service that is just right for EVERYONE. There is really nothing they don't have to entertain your mind, with every type of music."
"April 15, 2015","Pandora is a great app it lets me pick the station I want to listen to and has great music but the only down side I see to this is that you need WiFi access but if it didn't needed WiFi it would be a good seller over all this is a great app : )"
"September 13, 2016","TO MANY COMERCIALS SINCE IT BECAME MORE POPULAR BUT LOVE OTHERWISE. SOME STATIONS SEEM TO PLAY THE SAME CAROSOUAL OF MUSIC BUT THANKFULLY YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 100 STATIONS."
"February 10, 2016","I connot find the exit button anywhere on the new update. Why is this. I have to sign out and sign in everytime im on pandora now. Please fix this. I love the app and rate it 5. Just fix."
"January 2, 2013","I really enjoy listening to music and I like the idea that you could chose the artist you want to listen to. However, if I type a specific artist I hate the fact that you listen to one of their songs and then a different artist comes on. They don't play the songs from the artist you choose consistently. They'll play one song but then go to a different artist and then back to your artist....I don't really care for that style. If I put in Prince, I only want to listen to his music...."
"August 7, 2015","I've tried most of the streaming music apps and this one works best for me and my preference for classical music. My only complaint would be that it tends the treat ""new age"" and classical music as the same. They are very different."
"December 10, 2016","Its great to set up Pandora on cell phone and still access TV for show watching. Good music."
"September 14, 2013","Pandora is one of the things in my life that never disappoints. I have had no problem with reception on my devices. With it's astounding variety of music the only limitations are on me for lack of creativity in my selections. In a lull at a recent party of mine someone talked about skating to a song and before you knew it we created a play list of the song and everyone was rocking and telling stories for the rest of the night."
"October 16, 2017","I like pandora because I can choose songs I like and cancel songs I don't like"
"June 12, 2012","People who give this app 1's are stupid because it's so awesome. I don't. get why people give this one star it's awesome cause when I put a band name it gives me the songs thar I want. Plus, when you want to just change it you don't have to get rid of the other radio, you could still keep it. The only thing that ticks me off is that commercials come up every 6 songs , but I'm still giving this app a 5 star rating. Don't ever listen to the people saying that it freezes or anything like that. So, get the app seriously, GET THE APP!!!!!!"
"January 22, 2016","Sometimes it will only play a few songs then stops then wont play none and sometimes it won't play at all ...I love Pandora its my favorite but idk why its not working on here ."
"August 24, 2015","I can actually Jam out on my Kindle Fire"
"January 20, 2017","Works very well. Nice in a private setting with friends with no interrupted moments. Best when in the car and there is a really limited choice of music stations."
"November 30, 2012","I listen to Pandora constantly while on my kindle fire. up until a few weeks ago I would have definitely given this app 5 stars. but lately it gets stuck every few songs almost every time an ad comes up. I have to keep exiting and opening it up again just to hear a few more songs before it gets stuck again. I even uninstalled and reinstalled but that did not do any good. Pandora still seems to be running great on my Pc though. weird. please fix this problem because it is very annoying!"
"December 13, 2016","does not respond to request, plays sometimes, repeats back something else then requested. acts like a stubborn child use to work ok now I don't know."
"January 5, 2015","This does not work very well at least for me with z2 xperia tablet"
"April 8, 2013","I work in a cubicle where I get a lot of distracting noise from a nearby conference room and other cubicles near me. Listening to music on Pandora has helped me block out the distractions and focus on my work. Great selection of music and ability to customize your stations. The only issue is that it eats up a lot of bandwidth on my phone if I am not on wifi...just need to make sure your device is on wifi."
"November 16, 2013","Excellent source for a variety of music. I enjoy playing Pandora music from different artists. I use it to play in my car radio and at home on a bluetooth speaker."
"April 29, 2017","great bedtime music...fall asleep great... many thanks..(never relized 50's music was so bad )!"
"October 20, 2016","I really enjoy Pandora!"
"October 28, 2017","I hate all the ads, and the fact that you cannot turn it off, you have to hit pause button."
"April 10, 2014","Easy to install. Love the music!!!! Enjoying reading and listening at same time. I love all m u sic great selection."
"August 16, 2013","Works pretty well. Wish I could pick the songs. But it is just like radio and it is free, so I can't really complain,"
"July 28, 2017","Like"
"December 28, 2016","I love pandora. I always find the music that I want to listen to. The only downside to pandora are the commercials 🙁."
"January 6, 2013","This is a wonderful free product. Selection--wow!! I haven't had trouble with commercials or dropping things they way some were complaining about. The product is great. Set stations as you want, delete as you want, skip songs. No problems. I was skeptical about this product but a friend of mine also got it on her tablet and she loved it so I thought I would go ahead and give it a try. Love it!!! No problems and if you don't like it you can delete it, it isn't hard. No complaints!! Thanks."
"October 9, 2017","I think Pandora is not that fun to listen to, but me, yes I like Pandora , Pandora makes me play my Drums."
"October 8, 2013","It plays music as it should. Very easy to add stations and all the things you can do with it on the PC. But on the kindle, I need to go to the settings and log off before I shutdown, otherwise when it starts back up, it freezes on the opening blue screen and I need to remove it from the device and re-download from the cloud to get it to work again - after reinstalling you get the login screen like you would if you had logged off. So, its ok, its just that you can't remain logged in, and that's a bit inconvenient."
"February 11, 2013","Love this app. I put my earbuds in my kindle and fall asleep listening to my fave songs from today and fromt he 1980's!! Great app!!!!!"
"April 15, 2015","It is so great when I can turn on Pandora and go to a station that plays only songs that I want to here, this app has a station for everyone even people who like to listen to instrumental where it's just like a brass symphony or brass set. This app is for everyone!!"
"October 23, 2016","I choose the music ."
"June 19, 2017","Love the App. Hearing music I like and being able to fine tune the list is perfect."
"March 20, 2013","I loved Pandora. I use to listen to it when I went to bed. Well one day, I got a message saying that I had exceeded my limit of 40 hours that month. It said if I would just pay $.99 I could listen for the rest of the month for free. Since I loved it so much I took the offer. I then proceeded to leave the app after it said I had successfully purchased my rest of the month. When I came back later that day, it gave me the same message. I figure it just didn't register the first time so I went and checked my acount. When I looked Pandora did take the $.99 from me but didn't register it. Being annoyed I just paid again. Then I was listening to my music and it kept skipping songs. My mother told me to uninstall it and then reinstall it. So I uninstalled it. When I went to reinstall, it kept failing. So that means I lost $2 to Pandora. I know it's not much, but when I only get a gift card of $25 for my kindle on gift giving holidays, it makes me a bit frustrated. I want my money back! How do I ask for it back?"
"March 27, 2016","Love Pandora Rocks!"
"July 14, 2014","Sure it plays some music you actually want to listen to, but everything else you don't want it to play comes in abundance! so please make it more careful! so many artists I haven't even heard of pop up! I want it to stop!(please!)"
"June 4, 2013","Its a really great app for music. You can listen to different types of music (pop, country, ect.) And if you don't like a song you're listening to: don't worry. You can tap a ""next"" button which takes you to a different song. But beware! There's only 6 times in an hour you can do this. Its free, and you get to listen to a bunch of music. If you want to go free on music, just get the app and you get to listen to free music. Enjoy!"
"January 3, 2017","A great radio i listen to it most of the day while working"
"August 10, 2013","This is so awesome the choice of music is amazing and helps when you are stressed and need calming music. Love"
"March 10, 2012","okay this app is totally pimped out but I mean come on! This app does not play sensored music, so its not great for kids under 13. But the app itself is amazing and you can create your own station and listen to that genre. But there is also another problem, the advertisements are outta control! Who wants to listen to dating ads every other song???? It told me that I can upgrade to Pandora1 for 3.99 a month and I cant afford that. so just listen to this review!!!!!!!! FROBRO OUT!!!!!!!"
"May 24, 2017","Good"
"November 20, 2016","It is a birthday gift"
"March 4, 2014","It took awhile to figure out the ins and outs of operating this app but I do love it now and it was not hard to figure it all out. These Entertainers can really cut a rug on videos and albums but some of them need more experience to entertain live shows. Don't get me wrong but they need better instruments also and lots of ORIGINAL RIFFS to grab that Brass Ring. I wish all of our musicians the very best..."
"April 5, 2013","I have always loved pandora. I have it on my computer,roku player,and blueray player. It is easy to use and has great muisic."
"January 4, 2017","Love the fact that I can make my own stations to the music I enjoy most! All kinds of music for all the times of my life! Can't beat that!"
"April 8, 2016","For some reason every time I try to open this app up it automatically shuts down. Tried reloading it several times still nothing. It has always perfectly up until today. I really like this app. What can I do to fix it?"
"April 14, 2013","Pandora is great! I tried the free app for just one day and decided that the yearly subscription is a great investment. I have been introduced to music that I did not know was out there. My library of hundreds of music compact disks do not get played much these days. I like how I can customize Pandora and experience a wide selection of artists. I highly recommend the paid subscription version of Pandora!"
"September 7, 2017","Good"
"October 30, 2017","Works great and I love the music"
"August 10, 2015","I really like Pandora. It never fails to offer the types of music and entertainers I like. I can choose jazz, classical, classic rock and roll, gospel, or any type I want. Or, I can choose anyone from Michael Buble to Arrowsmith! It's a wonderful place to escape or have as a companion while working at the computer."
"June 4, 2013","It expands my musical horizons as well as letting me listen to my established favorites ... This app is well-designed."
"October 27, 2016","Fantastic !!!!!"
"January 20, 2017","I'm a music junkie so this was a no brainer for an app to add to my Fire tablet. It gives me the variety between the Prime music and Pandora stations. I bluetooth the audio to a Motorola Sol speaker."
"December 13, 2016","Sadly, my kindle doesn't have the same adblock features my laptop does, so I get the pandora ads, but otherwise very pleased with the app."
"December 28, 2012","I've been using Pandora for probably 6+yrs now and upgraded to the premium edition after only a couple of months. It is my main music source. I recommend it to everyone. I just got a Kindle Fire for Christmas so now I can take Pandora with me."
"March 1, 2016","What's with all the steps to listen to the music? Before it was one quick step. Now it's like I have to sign up every time I want to listen. Sometimes that's too hard to do while I'm driving. HATE IT!!"
"October 25, 2017","I love Pandora. It is truly a great music product that I find to be superior to any competitors."
"May 5, 2016","This app is easy to use and the only slight downside is that ypu have to pay for no ads and such but it's still very cheap, (7$ I believe, don't quote me) and is worth it.  5/5"
"September 1, 2017","Great music"
"July 18, 2017","It's great. Only problem is I wear down my batteries all the time."
"June 25, 2017","""This app is the best app for cleaning and for DANCE PARTIES!!!!!! Other recommendations are I Heart radio and (PANDORA)!!?!?!?!?"""
"December 22, 2013","we listen to pandora exclusively. just love being able to chose our music.whatever your mood, there is a station to match it."
"February 13, 2016","We use this all the time to find jams to party or sleep to, toddler approved. I especially love the rockabye channel, nice lullaby versions of green day, guns n roses, and Dr. Dre. Good times."
"October 19, 2013","Who doesn't like free internet radio, this is a wonderful app and you can listen to a wide variety of singers. From Christian artists to Screamo, and Classical to modern day Rock. You can even skip songs you don't like (but there is a limit of skips) Five Star! Woohoo if you love this app has much as I do click yes!"
"May 16, 2017","I am really enjoying the diversity of music"
"June 18, 2017","Great music around the Tampabay area."
"January 1, 2012","I use the Pandora app daily and have been able to find whatever music genre I need to fit my mood or act as appropriate background music while reading. Sound quality is excellent on the Fire, and the app has been almost glitch-free. One feature I really like is the ability to link to Amazon's mp3 store for an item corresponding to what you're listening to (if you like what you're hearing and want to buy it). Pandora provides amazing entertainment value on the Kindle Fire, and in my opinion has something to offer any user."
"March 5, 2014","Because pandora is epic, and knows what you like, and how you want it served. Pandora creates radio stations around suggestions (band name/song) that you give it. It's awesome, and super customizable. Best thing is it's a radio station. It's a different constant mix up.  also, stick your phone/ tablet in a ceramic or metal bowl. ""speakers"""
"November 6, 2017","Outstanding. I'm an old seasoned senior that enjoys 50s. Rock and. Roll and 50s. Oldies. Melodys. I'm in seventh heaven"
"April 26, 2015","As always one of my favorite apps for music"
"October 7, 2017","Have been a Pandora customer for several years and love designing my own stations."
"May 4, 2017","Comes in clear. Let's me pick my type of music. I can change with the day and let's me pick my favorites."
"June 14, 2017","Good"
"September 4, 2013","It's good to be able to reach back to the vocalists and musicians of the 40s and further. Particularly the composers and lyricists who wrote for them. I especially love the jazz sounds of the smaller combos as well as the rhythms behind the likes of Clooney, Christie, etc., etc.."
"September 22, 2017","Best music app out there"
"August 7, 2015","I used to LOVE Pandora I used it all the time, but then my kindle had an issue and I had to restore it to factory settings. I got all my apps back, including Pandora, the app must have ""upgraded""(even though the setup, to me, looked like a five year old decided to move things around)I couldn't find anything at first(still don't know how to bookmark songs)but I got used to it. And then my Pandora started acting up, at first not very often it would just sit there after a song was done playing and it would just load, I would just go out of it and come back and it was fine, then that started becoming more frequent, and just now, I tried to go onto Pandora and every station I tried, Pandora just kept skipping all the songs, none of them would play they just kept coming on and then just skipped it, even the ads would be skipped. I tried deleting the app and put it back on, it would do the same thing. I deleted it and reinstalled it again 3 times, I tried everything, nothing would make it stop it just kept skipping all the songs. I am done with it, this is ridiculous, if it isn't fixed ASAP I'm just done with Pandora and I'm finding a new radio app."
"June 16, 2015","I love it, and would give it 5 stars, but it has lags!!!!!! This one time, I couldn't log in for a day because of the lag! I finally deleted it and got it again. On the computer one, its really slow. I wish I could use it without wifi also. Otherwise, I love it!!!"
"September 5, 2012","Update: I canceled my Pandora subscription after they raised the price. Just not worth it to me anymore... Too expensive to get rid of the ads... I'd rather just listen to the free version and deal with the ads.  Former: I listen to Pandora every day. In the car, at the office, at the gym... There is simply no other way to get this much music for so little money. I force close every once in a while when I undock from the car or change power sources. Otherwise it's perfect."
"October 17, 2017","Easy to setup your favorite stations"
"August 3, 2017","LOVE IT ITS AMAZING"
"December 9, 2016","We love Pandora.....listen to it every day since signing up! It's great being able to pick out the musice we really enjoy. Hurray Pandora!!! Ken & Margie"
"October 14, 2017","Nice music. Way too many advertisements. Free. You get what you pay for."
"April 20, 2017","Never had an issue before with this app. But now it is messing up. It plays maybe 5 seconds of a song and then the app just closes out. I have tried everything."
"November 25, 2015","We love to use Pandora for music in our store but recently there has been the add about curved penises cause by peyronies disease which is really inappropriate for a place of business. Wish they would do away with that add!"
"July 31, 2013","I have this on my phone and my kindle and Pandora is really useful. It sometimes limits the amount of songs you can skip, which is unfortunate since sometimes you have to listen to songs you don't like, and there are ads, but the app itself is really helpful.  It's great to have one specific genre and for the music to stay on that track. I really enjoy the app."
"August 5, 2017","Great"
"December 31, 2012","Pandora is free, good music. You can even chose the station! Cool stuff! Get it, you won't regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!Music lovers should definately get this. You also get to skip if you want to! Gggggggeeeeeeeettttttttt iiiiiiittttttttt!!!"
"February 9, 2016","Love this app! The only downside is it stops playing if you do not or can not interact with the tablet after so long. I was making cookies and could not touch the screen when it stopped."
"August 6, 2015","You can like songs you can listen free you can search artist, it's like the radio but you can skip songs but only certain amount. The have every genre you can think of. Even old music from way back when and even songs and genres that doesn't play on radio👏😎😀💯💯🅰"
"November 21, 2012","This app is amazing! For every hour you listen to Pandora Radio, you can skip 6 songs. So if a song you don't like comes on, you can skip it! Also, if you type in a band or something like Maroon 5, it'll play songs similiar to Maroon 5 along with Maroon 5 itself. :) Get it! Also, the ads are usually every 3-5 songs. They are only 10-15 seconds long typically. They have ads so they can pay for the songs they play! Please get this app!"
"March 2, 2016","I am still learning HOW to use this Pandora. Sometimes I cannot get it to play for long periods of time! then suddenly it will start playing! What am I NOT doing right?? this is a new product to me!"
"August 29, 2013","Pretty cool to listen to genres you like....love how it customizes your playlist based on your ""likes""....will use Pandora often...."
"July 21, 2016","Good selection of music. Does not load consistently. Not particularly user friendly for someone like me, who is not skilled technologically."
"November 15, 2016","Love being able to listen to a certain genre of music."
"December 22, 2012","Great app! My stepdaughter suggested I gt this and I love it! I love the feature of making radio stations customized to my preferences!"
"November 12, 2016","Didn't work"
"May 2, 2017","So nice to pick favorites! It goes wherever I go."
"September 13, 2015","The app mirrors my smart phone and iPad apps which I thoroughly enjoy. Being able to customize the apply for my listening tastes is excellent. The free version does not have excessive advertisements. Enjoy! (PS: Be mindful that the app uses data in the smart phone when used away from WiFi."
"February 13, 2016","The app will not play music! It will play a single song, and then will stop playing. It wil show the next song, but won't let me hit play, skip, etc. I love Pandora, but will have to listen to music elsewhere if the app doesn't even work!"
"April 25, 2015","Absolutely love it!"
"January 23, 2014","I love listening to music without having to put in the CD or looking for the CD especially when I am trying to relax."
"August 23, 2017","Love Pandora listen to it ever day while at work really enjoy the free trials for 1hour without interuptions and the replay."
"January 30, 2017","I love it and the whole family uses it for all our music needs. I don't know the last time I even listened to regular radio."
"July 15, 2013","I have a couple of music downloads, and I perfer Pandora. Free version still won't let you forward past songs as much as you'd like..."
"July 20, 2012","The Pandora app is really very functional and I rarely encounter problems with it... but when I do, it's extremely frustrating. The song will stop midway, only to move on to a 3 minute ad. Now my main problem with this app is that if you pause a song for more than a certain amount if time and you're on the Internet browser, the song will close and you have to go back to the homepage to restore. Other than that, it's a great app, I just wish these minor details would be fixed."
"July 14, 2014","I'm always listening to music at hhome so this is perfect because I don't have to buy any songs. or listen to the same songs over and over. So this is great because it has a huge variety of music!!! I recommend the: - ""Today's hits radio"" - "" Dubstep radio"" - "" Jasmine Thompson radio"""
"February 21, 2015","If you love music you should get PANDORA it is the bomb. I always listen to Pandora all the time in fact I am listening to it right now.it is very convenient.you can even pick your own music.there is even music for studying.HOW AWESOME. THANKS FOR DOWNLOADING PANDORA IF YOU DO THANKS......!!!!!!!#@SH"
"March 20, 2015","I like this app. I listen to it everyday at work. I like making radio stations and the music that is played is based on likes so the next time you get music you like. I don't mind the commercials don't feel to need to pay for the no commercial version."
"January 19, 2014","The product information indicated it was a 10-pack; 20 batteries, but I only received a 5-pack (10 batteries). It's too much trouble to complain so I just learned a lesson and will not order this item again."
"May 3, 2017","Love it. Pandora can really adds something to my routine."
"May 31, 2012","there are no technical issues with this app and I use it all the time on my Fire. however, I don't like getting audio ads. I don't get them when I listen his the web do why via an app? also I am now getting tmobile ads in Spanish. I don't listen to music in Spanish. this is really really annoying. additionally, I cant tweak my channels on the app like I can via the web. please add this as a feature. oh, please let me see songs I previously listened to like I can on the web."
"July 18, 2017","Luv it"
"November 5, 2016","Once you get your lists together. It's great."
"May 4, 2015","I've become extremely tired of the same commercials being played all the time if I switch stations even if I've heard the song over again I would like to be able to hear the artist I'm looking for not Beatles while listening to Pink Floyd"
"September 12, 2017","No need to download music when you have Pandora! It has so many choices at a single touch!"
"October 27, 2016","It is great!"
"May 21, 2016","Pandora is an excellent alternative when you don't have a radio"
"December 20, 2013","I Love This App! I'm Listining To It As I Write This Review:) It Gives You Free Music:) It Does Not Give You What You Want To Listin To When you make a station...It gives you a song that's like it... I kinda like that though, gives you more choices to make with your amazon card or itunes card. overall.... great app!!!"
"December 5, 2011","I downloaded this app 6 months ago on my Droid X and recently on my Droid X 2. Both times, I've enjoyed plugging in my phone with an audio jack into my car and surfing my stations. It sucks up battery pretty fast, so I also charge my phone in the car while listening to Pandora. And it only works if you have wifi or 3G available which isn't an issue unless you're driving far out in the countryside. I recommend this app and want to mention that I haven't had songs skip or not fully play. If I will, I'll update this review."
"January 2, 2014","Pandora has great quality, but when you make a station it will play a lot of different artists. Not even 50 percent of the music is the artist the station is supposed to play. You can skip songs, but you only get a certain number of skips. It also has adds. You have to pay $4.00 monthly to get no adds and other things that may annoy you. Overall it's a very nice app."
"August 17, 2015","I am 12. And I think that this app is the best app I have on my kindle. I believe there is literally only one flaw: Not everybody has it!!! Once again, I totally love this app. Five stars from me. ♥♥♥♥♥"
"January 1, 2015","Thanks for your review of Samsung Galaxy S III, White 16GB (Sprint) We're currently processing your review and we will email you at boricua2013jaquez@gmail.com as soon as this is complete."
"September 10, 2013","Pandora has successfully made an app that oust all the other music/radio to shame. Only the quick advertisements take away from what is fluid and complety personal listening experience. On top of that Pandora continues to before better and better updates keeping the music fresh and the features applicable to what you look for on the app. Overall Pandora dwarfs all other radio apps."
"April 2, 2012","It took me a while to really love Pandora. I don't know why. Having some control over what music you want to hear just sounded too good to be true. It really is as simple as that. Well, Pandora, I think I love you.  I use this app on my Kindle Fire. I love just about everything. One thing I wish that app could do is show the list of the songs I have 'thumbs upped'. As far as I know, this app cannot do that. Also, hate the ads...but I deal with them for free awesome radio."
"July 30, 2017","Its the best music app."
"August 24, 2016","Very limited repertoire in each category of music, especially CHORALE. SNEAKY increase in price from $3.99 to $4.99 per month for ad free listening."
"January 30, 2017","Hands down the greatest music app to date..... Thanks pandora!!!!"
"February 19, 2016","Nice music app. My hubby uses it more then me. He enjoys some particular stations . I'm more of a prime music person but this app isn't bad. He loves it and my father in law loves it so I have it on many devices. It works well. No lagging ever ."
"September 27, 2013","Amazing, how music listening has evolved from reel to reel-4 and 8 track-cassette-cd; now i dont need drawers of storage space to find music I feel like listening too at the moment. Just pick a genre, (learn how to set up files or channels ? Will probably help too) get to hear music that I like, but never would have known it without Pandora choosing to play it based on my chosen genres."
"July 22, 2013","My 16 year old daughter just loves Pandora - and has enjoyed discovering and setting up several eclectic types of ""stations""."
"February 2, 2016","I dropped Sirius because their music is 70 years old! They are so out of touch their ""Chill"" station is all vocals! If I create an instrumental station on Pandora, I won't hear a lyric for hours."
"August 2, 2012","Ok i'm 51 and never knew what Pandora was until my son who has an iphone showed it to me. Then found out I could get the app for free on my Kindle Fire. I love it. I think it is so neat how you make a album, type in a song or artist and it starts playing that song, then plays others song sort of like that one or even by same artist. And you click on thumbs up if you like it or thumbs down if you never want to hear that song again. It remembers. The only thing I wish was different is I wish that you could make a folder called MY FAVORITES and then drag all your songs that you absolutely love and want to hear over and over and over again into that folder. The way it is not you get to hear those you love, but others too and might not like everything playing. Sometimes I don't want to check out new songs in same catagory such as country, rap, techno etc. I just want to hear ONLY the ones I know the words to or that remind me of things."
"October 30, 2017","Great variety of music! Also a great price; $4.99/mo. with no commercials - gotta love that!"
"October 20, 2013","Downloaded this for my Android tablet and works fine except keeps dropping the song and moving to the next before the end of the song. I have deleted and reinstalled but still happens. Pandora is not my favorite as we have same issues in the car on my Android phone (4g Verizon) and on our TV. I still prefer iHeart which does not drop but I can't get on my old Tablet."
"October 17, 2017","The only problem is that the network losses station and signal a lot in the north east part of Philadelphia"
"May 28, 2014","I really like this app, and it is nice because if the device turns off, you can still listen to the music. You can make a new radio by entering the artist or song and the radio will play songs similar to the one that you typed in and made a station. Hope the review was helpful and look for my other review for covet fashion! Peace Out!"
"December 15, 2016","Pandora is great It has all the songs I remember from great times gone by. Thanks for the memories."
"January 18, 2017","I enjoy the variety of artists and music. Depending on the venue and activity my music tastes vary. The app is easy to navigate."
"March 7, 2014","Pandora gives me a choice to what music I want to listen to all the time. Whether old school or new releases. To have freedom to listen to what I want when I want and where I want 5 stars is not enough."
"November 8, 2016","Cool."
"May 4, 2017","Enjoy it"
"November 16, 2011","What a pain in the butt. You get some type of advert almost any time you perform an action. For example, you click to view an artists details, you go back to the song, there is an ad. The ad sizes vary in size and the 'x' to close them out is very tiny so what happens is you go to close an ad, for the fifth time in one track, and you end up launching the browser and getting hit with the ad. Screw it, I will keep forking over the cash for rhapsody.  Adding to the review. These ads are worse than a porn site."
"May 25, 2016","Too many ads. If u want to upgrade you have answer too many questions. Yes should mean yes I want to upgrade."
"November 15, 2013","We like it because we don't have cable... the free shipping is great. But have had some trouble with the network in watching the movies."
"September 6, 2017","Select performers that reflect the mood you're in and enjoy. An occasional click to say like or dislike will have various types of music well managed."
"March 28, 2016","I guess I'll be canceling. App won't open."
"December 25, 2012","I wish Pandora would allow me to pick the specific music I want to hear. I guess it wasn't designed to do that. So it's just a three star review from me."
"June 8, 2015","Good music app."
"November 1, 2017","Love it...people often ask me what music station I'm using... great choice"
"May 23, 2017","Love it, wish I could get complete albums on it"
"March 10, 2016","Not bad. Unfortunately the algorithm doesn't differentiate between stations. Eventually you will hear what you like from your Willie Nelson station on your Nine Inch Nails station."
"February 18, 2013","I always listen to Pandora now when I can get it through a hotspot at the gym. If I can't get it then I will listen to my songs that I have downloaded."
"August 21, 2017","I enjoy listening to all the old classic music without having to download it"
"November 29, 2012","ive used this app for around a year now but lately ive been using my kindle fire. and i noticed that when a commercial came on it would stop all the music and the loading icon came on.but it never played it so i would have to change to a different station. and then go back to it. it cant be my internet because its always full bars. so i dont know whats going on. so ya. it would be apprecieated if you could maybe see if you could fix this"
"January 29, 2013","Wherever you use Pandora, you gotta use it! I don't pay for the service, so I have to suffer through the ads. But, what it has done is suggest several different musicians to me that I would never have thought of. I then promptly go to Amazon and buy the CD (after listening to a few track samples of course). It is a great way to find out what's out there!"
"February 9, 2015","It is a good app, for the most part, but it has some problems. For starters, the ads. A few times, it played an ad in the middle of a song! Also, it is possible to taylor the station to play what you want, but once you do, it is stuck that way! Even if you delete the thumbs up and down, the radio is still not very diverse. Also, it doesn't have that much music, and it gets albums on very slowly. All in all, three stars, for problems."
"April 18, 2017","It wakes me up and puts me to sleep absolutely love it"
"September 8, 2017","Great!:)"
"February 7, 2015","they never play music i like"
"January 22, 2016","Have had Pandora on my Kindle Fire for months and listened every night. Two days ago it stopped working and I haven't been able to get it to work since. Works fine on my phone. Very annoying."
"July 31, 2017","rarely use the app but it was worth the purchase"
"November 6, 2017","I like the catagories. Stays true to form."
"October 24, 2017","Im very satisfied with the items"
"May 29, 2016","Fantastic, enjoyable, can choose any artist I want, I downloaded it on my kindle and go outtside when I do my gardening and its so peaceful and what a pleasure it is to listen too. Sincerely Marie"
"January 28, 2013","wowza this app is amazing!!! it is like having free music! similar to iheart radio, but you get to skip the songs six times an hour per station (unlike iheart radio, where you only can skip a few times for the whole app a day or something like that) . it is like having free music! plus, you get your own profile where you can even look up song lyrics and artist profiles! love this app! you must get if you want FREE MUSIC!!!!"
"July 12, 2012","Don't get me wrong I love the fact that they play great music for no price at all. Its really great that you do t have to go and buy your music for $ 1.00 but I think that they should update it because it plays songs twice after hitting the thumbs down button but at the same time I like to make sure that I don't want to hear that song. I also do t like that you have minnimum of 6 skips and that the commercials are pointless and stupid, I give it 2 thumbs up!:)"
"September 25, 2013","The free version of Pandora plays music at 128K, which is only good for people who have very low standards in audio quality. Pandora One has 192K sound, but the quality is nowhere near iTunes Radio. The game is over for Pandora. Apple is choosing people who are pillars of music to choose their own playlists, and the lack of crappy songs that comes with Pandora is but a memory."
"September 10, 2017","I tried downloading a few of the music apps in the store. Could not find any with the music I grew up with. My oldest daughter put me on to Pandora. She was right I found just what I was looking for . Thank you Tammy & Pandora."
"April 29, 2016","The latest release is fraught with issues."
"October 24, 2011","I can listen to Christmas music in October, thumb up or down songs to get a refined selection, create a station in moments, and do it all on my phone. LOVE. HTC EVO."
"June 10, 2017","I love it! I was able to get rid of my EXPENSIVE Sirrius radio!!!"
"May 25, 2017","Good music"
"December 23, 2016","Best music app ever"
"January 30, 2014","I love the new Pandora app. This keeps you from having to spend your money on separate pieces of music when you barely use them or you get tired of the song and wasted your money. If you like Pandora on your computer, you will love it on your Kindle. The only bad thing is that rarely it freezes, but when you restart or just exit and come back to it, all goes back to normal."
"November 15, 2016","Best way to listen to music ever!!"
"January 28, 2014","Not only is this app great you get to listen to your favorite songs with that said you have to create a channel your favorite song is on but you can listen to music while your playing games searching the web basically everything you get on you can still be listening to music check as I Wright this review I'm listening to music this app deserves a true five stars from every body"
"August 15, 2017","Love music therefore this is a perfect product for me."
"August 17, 2017","Excellent"
"January 13, 2016","No idea why this app is different from other Pandora apps, if you like a song or dislike it you have to rate it when it is playing you can't view played songs. And the screen saver is ugly."
"January 27, 2013","For a free product, Pandora does a fantastic job of allowing you to choose your favorite types of music and picking similar styles so as to let you hear a variety of music artists. Once I choose my artist stations it also allows for a shuffling of stations. I believe I could listen for three days straight without hearing the exact same song. Pandora is a great site..............Everyone should take advantage of it."
"April 8, 2016","Great place to buy music"
"October 27, 2014","I just downloaded Pandora on my Kindle and I'm loving it! Just amazing! I entered my favorite band and here I am rockin' like crazy! Great music, very limited publicity (thank God), fantastic selection! Thank you Pandora and keep on rockin'!! Who needs to buy music anymore! Not me! You had me at the first song!"
"March 17, 2017","Love the variety. Easy to use"
"July 20, 2016","I luv it. There r such different music genres to choose from. Literally its great. Im happy because being hispanic, its hard getting mjsic that i like such as reggaeton. I appreciate it, and im sure u will too. Get it. Trust me...u wont regret it"
"October 31, 2016","it pandora"
"April 12, 2013","Pandora radio is awesome! Thank you Pandora for making it possible to listen to free unlimited radio. I was elated to learn that you had dropped the limited minute radio use. Being able to not only create your own radio stations, but to create favorites (thumbs up) or never having to listen to a particular song again (thumbs down) is pure freedom. Your service is very much appreciated! Fun for the entire family...."
"September 6, 2017","A super App."
"September 4, 2013","Pandora is great for the gym. I can listen to all types of music and it makes my workout go by faster and more enjoyable."
"July 22, 2017","I can choose music to fit my mood."
"February 11, 2015","Works as expected"
"July 7, 2016","Great station, no need to constantly change station looking for something you like,,,,"
"May 21, 2012","Because I have never been able to stick with just one type of music to enjoy, Pandora is perfect for me. The site lets me select all the different types of music/artists together in one place for my listening pleasure without my having to do anything but rate the music as it is played. I tell Pandora who I like and they find music for my listening pleasure. Sometimes I use Pandora on my computer (with headphones) and sometimes I just listen over my HTC."
"December 21, 2012","I love this app on any device. It is so nice to listen to all the music you want to and it still has way less ads than listening to a radio."
"September 26, 2016","You have differently been more then I expected an I can listen all the time an my phone doesn't over heat thank you"
"June 5, 2014","Although the learning curve is a little steep even I was able to get what I wanted. The music comes in a variety of genres most of which I haven't had time to explore. You can save favorite tracks, search by artist, track or song. I still need to spend more time learning how to use it. But I'm very pleased so far."
"May 3, 2015","I like Amazon Prime radio better. Amazon allows you to repeat a song, advance to a later part of the song, shows the lyrics (Pandora dropped this feature from mobile), and has free downloads of some songs. Creating playlists also a big plus."
"May 19, 2016","I have always liked Pandora. They have a remarkable selection of music. It is easy to use and easy to choose the music you want to listen to. Not complicated at all. Yay."
"February 13, 2013","I love Pandora. I love being able to communicate with other users in comments on songs and artists. I also love being introduced to other songs like those that I already love. tip : if u have run out of your six skips just switch from that station to another and back again. same effect of a skip. if Iyar to choose one app over any other to have, I would choose paandora :) have fun with the best app ever!!!"
"November 10, 2013","Pandora is great and it seems to learn my musical tastes the more I use it. works fine on Kindle fire hd."
"January 23, 2016","Pandora has introduced me to a lot of musicians I now like, but I had not previously known. The only downside is that they only share a limited set of songs from each new musician. Too bad."
"February 2, 2017","Not too fond of Pandora too many commercial breaks if I want to listen to one artist Pandora play other artists in the same genre"
"September 10, 2017","I use it and love it💕👍"
"May 15, 2015","I like having a simple program for listening to random music. I prefer the Pandora algorithm over other services. But I accidentally disliked a song I actually like. Can't find a way to undo this. Seems like an obvious option to me, but not included."
"August 30, 2013","Pandora is to die for!!!! I have never loved any music service as much as I love Pandora. I have extremely eclectic tastes in music and there is always something I can find on Pandora to suit my mood. Kudos to Pandora for being so intelligent. Their info pages are great. Keep up the good work!"
"October 4, 2014","Whenever I want to open my one direction radio, it says Pandora has stopped. It won't let me listen to meatloaf, acdc, led zeplen, or foreigner, Styx, journey, Boston, Don felder, the eagles, or any of my favorite bands. I'm a ten year old and I'm getting so frustrated with this app."
"June 27, 2014","I think the app is great. My only complaint about Pandora is that you can't pick specific song's or artists that you want to hear, they just match you up to song's similar to the song and artist of your choosing, which can be frustrating but it's better than the radio for background music and I knew what I was getting so I still gave a 5 star rating."
"February 26, 2013","This is a great app, and I love Pandora. It introduces me to new songs similar to the ones I like when I search for my favorite bands. However, one problem recently came up. When I open Pandora, and my Kindle Fire locks, it won't unlock. I've tried holding down the power button, but nothing works. As far as I've found, it only happens with this app. If this problem is fixed, it would be a perfect app."
"August 25, 2016","I love Pandora they have a great selection of music. My daughter plays it all the time so I got it. better than the radio at times."
"December 8, 2011","I thought Pandora would run in Panama, since Amazon made a big noise about releasing a colossal amount of content for the Kindle Fire. The first app, I tried to download and install was Pandora Radio. To my disappointment, Pandora is only available for the U.S. market.  As you can imagine, I'm not a happy person, and there is not a smile on my face. Please Amazon, open up your Apps to the international market.  Omar Upegui R. Panama, Republic of Panama Central America"
"January 13, 2012","I was excited when Pandora became available for smartphones, and have been using it on my Android for a long time without any problems. Recently got a Kindle Fire and, again, it's great.  Unfortunately, recently it has had the tendency to occasionally start a song and freeze and skip after about 20 seconds. Also, I understand the need for ads, but recently they've gotten a bit overnumerous and repetitive.  But I love Pandora; it introduces you to new music, lets you customize your station based on the type of music you like, and the fact that you can now listen to Pandora without the 40-hour limit per month makes it only better.  I only wish the ads were a little shorter, more varied, and maybe a little less often. Also, the slight buginess needs to be addressed. But still, a solid app, especially for fans of Pandora online just getting smartphones or tablets. Four stars, easily."
"March 23, 2014","I love Pandora my teacher played Pandora on Friday we danced because we did every thing we had to do than my mom bought me a Kindle fire HD for my birthday so I downloaded Pandora it works perfectly and you can listen to new music from the station you know. I used to didn't like Taylor swift but now I LOVE her music Great app download it and you'll see."
"February 20, 2017","So this app is amazing but I wish you could listen to a song more than once but it is still great"
"March 22, 2015","Love the the vatriety of music. The genre classification is great as we we can give a thums down as just receive what we want to listen to, as Pandora removes songs you don't like. Great way to match music to individual tastes. Kudos Pandora!"
"December 24, 2012","All kinds of music whether it's for you or your kids. If you're in the mood for romance or in the mood for up beat music Pandora is for you."
"December 3, 2012","I use to love pandora it was a great way to listen to music and get a great variety of the artists i love but lately on my kindle and phone with the upgrade ill be playing a song the song will end and the app will not be running so i have to unlock my device and go to the app and wait an additional 30 sec. to listen to music its aggravating and is a waste of time fix the problem or your going to loose a customer"
"July 13, 2013","What sets Pandora apart is the ability to insert other groups or styles of music into a pre-set channel. You can essentially create your own preferred variety in the music, mixing and matching groups as you see fit to keep your ears happy. Lots of programs can play one group over and over. Few mix solely at the discretion of the user and do it as seamlessly as Pandora."
"May 11, 2015","fun"
"March 16, 2014","I love my Pandora app. It let's me customize my stations, and I get to choose my station. It would be nice to have more than five skips an hour"
"January 13, 2013","I use this app more than any app combined. I use the top comedian station and immediately I forget about whatever I am doing and am entertained the whole day. A+ app"
"June 20, 2013","Every time I paint a room, I've done it with Pandora blasting. With the help of Bonnie Raitt, Dire Straits, Chris Williamson, the Bee Gees, Phil Ochs, Bruce, Joni, and every other beloved musician of my life I have redecorated each room in our newly purchased home. The songs transformed our new home, new neighborhood, new community into wonderful old friends. We are home."
"July 22, 2013","Great! I like jazz and this is a method where listen is as a easy as finding a hot spot and enjoy."
"September 11, 2017","I always liked Pandora and have been a fan for a decade. Between Amazon Prime music and Pandora, they are both equally entertaining and can only get better"
"April 8, 2017","Pretty great!!"
"November 30, 2014","Great for any type of music lover!"
"July 6, 2016","I love the ability to find musicians whose work is difficult to locate in my town. Very much love the album and artist info included"
"March 26, 2015","Work well until you use it too much. I leave it on all day play list repeats frequently. Then I receive notices about overuse and the fact that they have to pay for each song. Don't offer unlimited play if you're going to complain about it!"
"October 22, 2016","I wanted an an app for soundcloud, but it wasn't available. This app has done well for being a second best."
"September 20, 2017","Easy to use"
"January 14, 2012","how could you not love all this music for free. somehow though my channels always seem to lean heavily toward the Beatles but still awesome app."
"March 30, 2013","I love Pandora...I didn't give it five stars, because of those silly ads.. I know they have bills too, but they get soooo annoying!"
"June 19, 2014","I tried downloading Pandora and it would not download.  SO DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!! I think you should not get it I don't see why you should get it!!!!!!!"
"July 20, 2014","WolfyNat here, love this app sooooo much because I can listen to music while I play games and mostly do anything else.... BUT here's a tip if you didn't know, it also doesn't just play music from the exact artist you searched up but I still love it, it's better that way and another tip there are ad's but I don't CARE =D..... SO get this app..... ITS FREE!"
"October 23, 2011","I have never had an issue with this program on my HTC Thunderbolt (tho I do pay for the service and I also have unlimited data) and I use it all the time. I pay the monthy fee and have several channels set up. One can quickly get tired of managing and not getting weary of a personal list of mp3 files. Pandora frees me from having to deal with that.  If you are using Green Power, you have to remember to pause Green Power or you will just get one song every 10 minutes."
"August 4, 2017","I love it I can play all kinds of music thank you keep the good work up."
"February 12, 2014","Pandora is a useful app for listening to various types of music. The Genome project has been succesful in creating an app that generates a radio station specific to your taste. Unlike other radio apps that play just the populatlr songs i like pandora because it plays all the songs on an album not just the mainstream ones."
"January 29, 2015","works as specified ..."
"June 26, 2017","Always good music"
"January 2, 2014","I love how you can listen to free music but you cannot go back to The songs that you just listened to. Also I don't like that when you type in a playlist or artist there are other artists like for example if you type in Katy Perry you would get a mix of Taylor swift, Lorde, and other artists. But besides all of that it is a pretty good app!!!"
"July 26, 2015","I love pandora but I've recently been having trouble getting into it on both my tablet and kindle. I end up having to uninstall and reinstalling the app in order for it to work. no problems on my desktop, tho."
"May 24, 2017","Will probably upgrade to the paid version."
"January 4, 2017","I love the ability to listen to classical, jazz, 50's, 60's, 70's music, and all my favorite artist at the touch of my finger."
"October 29, 2017","Loved it"
"September 23, 2016","Love Pandora. The ads are infrequent enough that I'm truly not annoyed. Need my phone to charge for work purposes, so I enjoy listening on my Kindle!"
"February 16, 2014","I just love Pandora and am really digging the new built-in alarm clock! So pleasant to awake to music. The suggestions are intuitive and I have found some fabulous music. A friend recently had me add the Classical Guitar station. It is an awesome acoustic addition to my daily mix."
"February 4, 2015","its okay"
"September 26, 2016","Good music it goes off music u like so it's like a personal dj n has different stations like u can have a workout station and a diveing station or a hype mix"
"August 6, 2017","Great music...like going to a concert with all my favorite musicians!"
"August 7, 2017","amazing"
"December 28, 2016","I only gave 4 out of 5 stars because I sometimes don't like the covers songs that get into my station. Other than that pandora is amazing!"
"October 30, 2013","Free is a relative term. What price is ""free""dom? In the case of Pandora's app the price is getting an annoying pop-up ad box in the center of the display virtually every 2 seconds. The curse, if you don't upgrade you will be haunted by never ending ads until time immemorial. Given that ad curse, you might think that they'd only deliver the Blues. But, to be fair, there are considerably more music genres to choose from. Hence the 2nd star. We each have different patience levels. You have to decide what you are willing to put up with ad-wise for the free app. Just know what you're getting into."
"June 21, 2014","Really enjoy being able to find whatever kind of music I am in the mood for. And free! Being on Social Security Disability does not allow for a lot of extras. With Pandora, I can find whatever I want and listen to it for free. Don't mind the commercials, they have to pay for their station of incredible choices somehow!"
"December 31, 2015","The reason why I love this app is because you can listen to any station you want so litsen up............   GET THIS APP   NOW!!"
"November 26, 2012","This app is awesome! You get to listen to music for free! The only thing I don't like about it is that you don't get to pick your songs... you get to pick the station you made but not the song. You make your station by typing in a band, song or singer. Then songs will play and if you like them you push the thumbs up and if you don't push the thumbs down. This app is the best! You won't regret it at all."
"October 5, 2017","great app"
"July 17, 2017","Great app!"
"June 12, 2013","Enjoy the music but I don't like being unable to skip songs as often as I would like. Some genre incomplete"
"August 4, 2017","Great value"
"January 3, 2013","I have Pandora on my tablet, my computer, on my internet TV and on my phone. I no longer have to put up with commercials just pure music."
"November 6, 2012","this is a good app because if you want to listen to music on the radio than here you go. if you know a song but cant remember the name of it it tells you and you can write it down like I do.when I couldn't remember a song I ask my cousin and she told me the name of the band but not the song. so now I get the band and the song.well I hope you lin it and remember if I reviewed it it means it good.bye y'all."
"June 17, 2013","I don't listen to it enought to make any great decisions. I try to listen to it at work. Music I have chosen is good."
"August 7, 2014","Good app but Iheart radio is better."
"July 20, 2012","I have the Kindle Fire, and this is one of the first apps I downloaded. After using it for several months, I decided I would leave a review because I base most of my purchases on others' reviews as well.  I use Pandora on my PC, and the Pandora app hasn't let me down on my Kindle. It's free, feels like the website, and runs in the background while I read a book or surf the web. I would say this is a must-have app!"
"November 15, 2012","when i upgradws from a kindle fire to a kf hd i swapped all my apps over expecting them to all work the same. im an avid pandora user however ive encountered only one problem thats extremely annoying. when im ready to close pandora the little menu button doesnt work. so i have to just pause it and forget about it. i love pandora but its super annoying that i cant close the app whenever im done with it."
"December 30, 2014","Love Pandora. Wasn't a fan a year ago, but am now. Love it either on the computer or online through my Kindle. I also can get it on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Nook as well that is android, and it is fun to pick your music and to listen to your channels of old and current music."
"January 26, 2017","I love this app. It gives you music on the go and you can play it all night long. I play songs to help me fall asleep at night."
"January 20, 2016","The app recently updated and now it won't load on my device. I have checked every other reason for it not to work and discovered it is just that app that is not working on my phone."
"January 8, 2015","A little outdated."
"October 16, 2014","Pandora is awesome and amazing. It has all the music, station, and artists you want. And you get to rate the song thumb up or thumb down. Pandora shows you the lyrics and about the artists to the song your listening to. Pandora is wonderful, awesome, and amazing."
"June 28, 2016","Able to work out to my own music selections. Great variety of music. Create your own radio station. The best part it is free."
"October 28, 2011","I have a Nexus S (Sprint) and it usually takes 4-5 times for Pandora to finally open and let me play a song. Usually it gets stuck at a screen with Pandora title on a blue background screen, but nothing else. I have to exit out, and try cycling thru the startup process several times before it lets me get to the point where I can play music. I don't use Pandora on my phone much because of this bug, and it drives me crazy because I love Pandora on my computer."
"December 15, 2014","i did."
"July 12, 2015","Gone. I've downloaded this several times, 1NC here, several from playstore. In weeks weeks I didn't use so gone, deleted. My son is 31 and it's his favorite way to hear music. Best I can do. I just want a phone. I done want to listen to music from my phone"
"December 10, 2013","Pandora is on my computer at home, on my wife's, son's, and my smartphones, on my tablet reader, and on my computer at work. I rarely listen to CDs or the radio, Pandora is all I need. Compared to Pandora, satellite radio is so not worth it. Pandora is the best app, and the first app I install on any new device. I love it."
"June 24, 2017","Good music"
"February 2, 2017","has introduced me to several great bands that I might have never heard of otherwise"
"December 9, 2015","I love Pandora because you can listen to whatever music you want! Such as Michael Jackson, weird al yankovic,Taylor swift, Nirvana, and Janet Jackson.GET PANDORA AS SOON AS YOU READ THIS!!!  Thanks for reading! Molly Engram"
"August 1, 2017","Everytime I'm using this app and reopen it on my HD8 tablet, it always shows the previous song name rather than the current song name. To find out what I'm listening to, I actually have to wait for the song to end. This app needs more work on it asap."
"June 4, 2016","This is a great app that gives me the opportunity to listen to smooth jazz. Something I've been missing since the smooth jazz radio station stop playing in the area I live in."
"December 12, 2014","obvious"
"December 12, 2015","Its so easy and free apps my brother and my sister have it and they love it and its so nice for the holidays for Christmas especially. I reccomend it for lots of people."
"February 11, 2014","this is a great app. I love that I can find classical music and jazz and all the genres I could ever want. I'm using it now while typing this reviews."
"July 18, 2015","The ads and not letting you skip more than a couple songs are really irritating. Especially when you cant add a specific song. I will listen to it because it is free. Will not pay for the supposed add free version. That is why you purchase the music and put in a CD."
"April 7, 2012","when I first installed Pandora, it was amazing but then when it automatically upgraded, the things I liked about it changed. before the upgrade, if I were to skip six times I could quit Pandora then start it again and would be able to skip all over again.now after the upgrade if I skip six times and quit,I cannot skip again.what is the point in listening to the music you want to hear if you cant skip the music you DONT want to hear."
"January 25, 2013","Hello I am Booyah reviews and u will see me on reviews more often. Welcome back! This app ""Pandora"" is probably the most popular music app on the app store! I love the music and theres no problems except one! You can only skip 6 times on each music station you add but its not that big of a deal because they have any music you want! I hope you like this app as much as i do!!"
"September 19, 2017","I love the variety of music with minimal commercials!"
"August 10, 2013","I love Pandora! I've set up over a dozen personalized ""stations"". I can hear whatever music I am in the mood for, from classical to Supertramp, to Sade, to Fun., and whatever similar artists and songs that Pandora pulls. The ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" I can give each selection helps to tweak each station even further."
"August 15, 2015","Love the app. Recently there was an update to kindle and since a lot of issues. At least there's music playing again. But now my kindle keeps deleting the app. I have to re download almost daily."
"October 15, 2015","Pandora is designed to recognize artists and songs that match your previous thumbs up designation, and avoid artists similar to previous thumbs down designation. This is a great way to customize your own stations."
"November 27, 2013","i liked Pandora before a lot but when I updated it,it started freezing 4 or more times in one song but also when I went into it the screen was blue while It was playing a song it just said ""Pandora"" with all the dots around it. I shut down my kindle and it did not work so I am not able to like dislike or skip a song"
"March 9, 2012","This app is great...especially at work. I can listen to all my favorite music and not have to worry about what my co-workers think."
"November 8, 2016","Pandora is the BEST they ever made for the music choice you want."
"June 19, 2015","Works amazing and never cuts out, can find any band, song, an genera. I listen to it all th time an love it, recommend getting it if you listen to a lot of music and have a long range or music you enjoy."
"October 16, 2012","I have listened to Pandora for several years and was very pleased to see it made available for the Kindle Fire."
"August 28, 2012","Well I really love this app I only have one bad thing to report. I have a station by an artist so I expect mostly their music but that doesn't happen.it isn't all that bad sometimes it makes me enjoy new music. And it really needs a DO NOT PLAY THIS BUTTON for Rihanna don't Hate me I don't really like it anymore.AGAIN I LOVE THIS APP ESPECIALLY THAT IT STOPS PLAYING AFTER WHO KNOWES WHEN DURING MY SLEEP B)"
"August 25, 2014","I enjoy Pandora and it is easy to use."
"November 28, 2014","great and very good."
"November 16, 2016","I don't like the ""other artists"" that are downloaded when I select the artist that I want to hear."
"June 25, 2017","I love listening to it while cleaning the house and other times, too. I love you can pick an artist you like and they give you others, too."
"June 29, 2013","When I first got this app it was the best thing that ever happened to me. After a few months it stoped working so I unistalled it. Then a month later I installed it again to see if it somehow fixed its self... it did... but as of today (6-29-2013) It refused to play any songs. I am sad that pandora and I have such an on again off again relationship. :("
"April 28, 2017","Love choosing my own styles"
"April 11, 2014","I love Pandora, and use it everywhere. I can select the artists, music, comedy, etc. And choose not to listen to a track again, or more often. I wish I could forward more often, though. The list doesn't have the abc column on the right anymore, so I have to scroll through the whole list to get to Z, rather than hit Z. Why they changed it, is a mystery."
"October 15, 2016","Very pleased with the music choices available."
"December 29, 2012","Okay people,it seems like EVERYONE is saying stuff like ""this app has to much ads"",or something like ""it isn't working"",but it works AWESOME on my kindle fire hd that I got on Christmas.in fact,I'm listening to it right now. I listen to it about everywhere. Usually I listen when I'm playing bad piggies,my little pony,or survival craft.Usually I also listen to Steadman5 radio.3 words for le app:this.is.epic. -derpy hooves"
"December 21, 2013","best music app ever. I have never had it mess up and not many ads. I recommend this app to evreyone"
"December 27, 2011","this app has worked perfectly for my kindle fire. the only adds I've encountered are small little ones at the bottom of the screen that can be exited out, makes no sound, and doesn't interrupt the flow.of.music. I'm getting full, clear songs, too, and this app has done a great job of selecting the music I like. you can even bookmarks songs and artists. My only complaint is that you can't access your list of bookmarks until you sign in online."
"February 12, 2015","great"
"September 9, 2014","this app is awesome because you can get as many stations as you want and you can get followers and follow Ppl to see what are there fav music. if you don't want that you can have a private account and just use it for music. I LOVE HEAVY METAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"December 29, 2014","I love this app you can put on music and then exit out and your music will still play and you can choose the situation you want.LIke I listen to country music that's it and if country is all I put in that's all it plays. I love this app so much I listen to it a lot."
"November 15, 2016","Love it !"
"March 9, 2014","I have been using Pandora on my laptop for years, I can't imagine why I have waited to get it for my phone for so long. I had tried to download this app from the Pandora website several weeks ago, but was completely unable to. The one thing that is certain about Amazon is that when you download an app from Amazon, you have got it. Quick & easy, that is the way it should be , and is with Amazon."
"June 26, 2017","Love Pandora"
"December 7, 2014","Ever since Amazon updated their OS for Kindle Fire HDX, the Pandora app has been essentially rendered useless. It keeps crashing, turning off randomly and skips songs. I've contacted Mayday Bout the problem, and they are essentially of no help."
"July 30, 2014","Good for having a large amount of music, but the menus are impractical and hard to navigate."
"January 20, 2015","My subscription cancels every month for no known reason and then the price goes up another dollar. This was my preferred music app for 5 years, but now I've switched to Spotify."
"July 20, 2012","Look if you don't like listening to commercial then buy your own songs!! There is an occassional advertisement, and when it does come it only last 30 seconds at the most. Its free to listen to so yes of course your gonna need advertisements to pay the bills for Pandora. Great songs, and so many stations avalible. I would definitely recommend this app if you would like to listen to add types of music for free!"
"September 12, 2016","Love the songs it goes great with the stations. but to many commercials come on like its on then another comes on after one already came on"
"July 1, 2016","I like Pandora, but since the last update the app won't work. Just the load screen& never goes anywhere. Please fix!"
"January 7, 2017","This app on my kindle fire is the only one that will not load. I have tried turning off my device, disconnecting and reconnecting to WiFi, and uninstalling and reinstalling, but nothing has worked so I'm uninstalling permanently."
"March 7, 2017","This app is Really cool! You can put different music on it and it helps if you bring your phone or tablet somewhere, you can listen to music wherever you are!!🐢🐢💖😃😍😂😬🐬🐬"
"March 29, 2016","Love it!!! This App has the ability to fit my every mood, brings back great memories as well as opens me up to new music and new artists."
"May 23, 2017","Great selection"
"December 29, 2016","great selection and the music sounds very clear, I am a new customer and just learning how to use Pandora"
"May 30, 2015","I like the idea of having music wherever I go Pandora is perfect for me I take it everywhere I go with my headphones so I can listen to my country or whatever I decide to listen to thank you so much Pandora"
"September 1, 2017","Wanted for my Alexa but not compatible great idea need to expand to iPhones"
"May 4, 2014","I appreciate the Pandora for being their when the study blues are near. I love to plug in my favorite radio stations like Alicia, Jennifer, Kelly, Chaka, Anita, Phyllis, Fantasia, Whitney, etc. The music I love and other talents of the world that keep me striving and my mind exhilarated!"
"March 24, 2013","This is a good music app. Ive used it quite a bit for listening to music I like. Easy to use."
"April 25, 2014","This is a free music station. You make custom stations and you put what kind of music you like for example if you like let it go from frozen you put that as add variety and it plays music it thinks you will like, like other disney songs. This is fun and prettty cool way to JAM it! woohoo!"
"March 8, 2017","the new pandora website is terrible. why did they change a good thing. the new site has lots of bugs, hard to navigate, and over designed. Im moving over to spotify. Sorry"
"August 20, 2012","I love music so does everyone else in my family and we have this on the computer and so I decided I put it on my kindle now I barley use it cause it has the same stupid commercials"
"May 28, 2017","love it"
"August 12, 2017","I found Pandora to be of no value. If i had paid for it i would feel cheated. The promise of liustening only to music i like is a lie. The stuff they offered when i asked for Mozart was stuff I would never even classify as the same genre. I can't even imagine what genre that stuff was part of. Very disappointed! I've uninstalled it. I might try spotify (?) or some other music app. Very disappointed! If i could i would give it a rating of minus stars ! ! ! VERY DISAPPOINTED ! ! !"
"June 17, 2016","Love it, Your programming selections are fabulous something for everyone musical appetite. Great company all day, much better than counting sheep at bedtime👍👌"
"February 8, 2012","Pandora is great, I've had it since December of last year and everytime I play it the sound is great. The music plays very clear. I get full songs and my own choice of playlist. I personally like Old school and R&B and I just love the selections that are played. My fiance' plays it more than I do and he loves it. He's a big music person and likes the same choice I do. Pandora is great, I'd refer anyone to it who is a music lover."
"June 15, 2017","Don't judge an app by international licensing laws that don't allow Pandora to stream overseas. I would imagine Pandora would love to stream outside the US. With that said, the app works as advertised."
"May 31, 2016","We love Pandora. We listen to our favorite music when around the house. We can type in the artist we want or the song title if we know it or just type in the kind of music we like to listen to. I love that there are no commercials and just constant music."
"December 24, 2012","great sound and covers my eclectic taste. Easy acess and quality programming. I am amazed at the eaze of operation"
"April 24, 2017","nice app"
"January 30, 2015","ok"
"January 26, 2016","This app helps me jam out when you are stressed and always plays the songs you want! This app is great😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃"
"November 20, 2016","Really like it, especially when trying to do some quiet reading"
"May 30, 2016","I love the different varieties of songs on Pandora."
"July 22, 2017","AOK"
"March 18, 2013","I love this app. One of my top ten must haves on my phone and tablet. The only improvement I wish the developer would include is the release dates of the songs or the album that is being played. I like listening to music from the fifties and sixties and I wish he release date would be included with the title of the song. Just a thought. Otherwise awesome app!"
"February 6, 2017","Love it. Useful and easy to use."
"April 30, 2017","Is ok"
"January 5, 2017","This is my favorite radio station on my Echo. I listen many hours a day."
"May 1, 2017","What's to say. I love blues and jazz."
"July 23, 2016","Alwseme so good wow"
"December 6, 2012","I really like Pandora but it doesn't do the one thing that MySpace does - let you create your own playlists of just the songs you like as well as allowing you to choose a radio station. Sometimes I just want to listen to my own playlist."
"April 21, 2017","<3"
"January 29, 2013","It's doing a lot better with the skipping problem. Maybe I was listening too much? I don't know. But now I turn Pandora on, and the option to zoom out to view bios, lyrics, and how the song relates to your selection is gone. What the heck? That means that I also can't go back and view songs that I liked but didn't catch the name of I. time. Not cool. ~Kindle Fire?"
"December 14, 2014","great"
"August 9, 2016","I Love Pandora! I put my earbuds in and shut the world out! I know there's other stations I could try, but I'm sticking to what I know, and that's PANDORA!"
"February 3, 2014","I Absolutely adore Pandora and use it all the time for my music. The only thing that is wrong is I would very much like to use the new alarm clock feature, where it starts playing music when you need to get or ect. I've only got it to work the first time I used it. After that it won't turn on. Will give five stars when this is fixed."
"May 30, 2017","okay"
"July 5, 2012","this app is musical because I can choose any song I would like to choose but there is two reasons I hate about Pandora number one is that sometimes after a song goes of they have commercials and its like really and the second thing I hate about Pandora is that after you skip like six songs they tell you to stop well we don't like some of these songs but other wise that I still thank the game is musical"
"October 18, 2015","Pandora is so awesome you can listen to whatever u want and it is FREE in the app store if u don't have Pandora u are nest up a little bit ilor a lot I don't know!!!!!!"
"December 29, 2016","It OK"
"May 31, 2017","What I like when I want it! It doesn't get any better than this!"
"October 2, 2012","i found some very funny comedy type channels and era specific ones that cater to my 80's hair band and late 70's self. mitch hedberg radio is friggin' funny! Great app!"
"May 28, 2013","Pandora allows you to listen to a variety of music (you name it!!!). It is great to listen to whole working or being occupied. It does not always play the songs you want even if you 'like' them. It only allows you six skips per hour and gives you a certain # of hours to listen for a month. Every month is renewed. If you use all of your ""Pandora minutes"", you have to pay extra to listen for the rest of the month. But it is a terrific and extremely useful app!)"
"August 10, 2016","This is a great app. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because I do like Spotify better."
"June 2, 2013","This is the best music ever! I love Pandora. Pandora always has the best music for you. Also, Pandora always has your favorite artists. I have a LOT of stations. My favorite station is Katy Perry station. I love Pandora. You should try Pandora,and all it's radio stations. If it's not Pandora it's not the best. If I could marry Pandora I would."
"May 5, 2013","it was good while it lasted. I could create any station based on artists I liked and I could like and unlike songs. then it told me I could only skip songs 6 songs an hour. then it told me I can only listen for 40 hrs a month and then after that its money. Pandora is a rip off. don't get it. GET I HEART RADIO. they don't have any limits I know of..."
"October 27, 2016","Just love it😍"
"April 15, 2017","great"
"December 14, 2014","love it"
"June 9, 2012","permissions. permissions. permissions. can someone explain to me why this thing needs to write to my calendar. or why it needs to read my contact data? it is a music streaming app, it should not require as many invasive permissions as it does. it get a star for being free and another for music selection, but loss stars for invasive permissions, forced closes, and inability to completely finish songs."
"October 13, 2012","Pandora is Awesome! It is the best thing ever. You can access it from your mobil device and from you laptop or computer. O.M.G. Im like totally speechless. Pandora is a great product. I wish I came uo with it. If you dont already own this app then you need to click that purchase button RIGHT NOW! Dont seccond guess yourself. Get It Get It NOW!   Pandora"
"December 1, 2015","wow!!!?I get free music and get this if you don't like a song you can make Pandora not play that song again by the press of a button!this app is my life!!!"
"June 20, 2017","Love it !!!"
"November 10, 2016","good Stuff !"
"December 28, 2016","nice music"
"May 5, 2013","I love this app! There isn't anything bad about it. Reviews that say ads are Annoying are wrong, because they don't bother you, when you have your head phones in!! I love that the app keeps up with the hits. Not only keeps up with new music, it has all your old favorites. I find this app sooo much better than getting any other radio app. (:"
"May 21, 2017","love listening to music"
"December 20, 2012","it needs to be fixed because it crashes everytime and it loads but nothing pops up its ok though its good sometimes:."
"October 1, 2015","I think Pandora is a great app to download on anything because you can listen to the music you like for free and. the timer for when you wake up is your favorite song."
"September 15, 2014","This app has more relevant songs than iHeart, so then I won't hafta keep bouncing around from station to station like I hafta on iHeart. This also lowers the possibility of me coming across something that'll make me wanna hurl... Thank You Pandora!"
"August 29, 2016","Pandoras great the only problem is the offline setting. I use Pandora all the time I'm home."
"August 20, 2014","I used to listen to Pandora all the time and loved it. But whenever I try to log on through my kindlefire it says ""We are having unexpected technical difficulties"". And now I can't go on Pandora. This has been happening for the past month now!"
"February 1, 2017","I can't sign in and it says WE ARE UNABLE TO FORWORD THE PROGRESS"
"May 3, 2014","This app is really cool the only thing I don't like about it is no unlimited skips and if you have say Katy Perry radio it will play some of her song but a hole bunch of other songs by other people. When I get a radio station that is who I want to listen to not other people."
"January 23, 2014","All kinds of music and classy stuff. Enjoy your favorite music, anytime you want. I listen to it all the time."
"February 2, 2015","This a really good app for lising to music but you only get a certian amount of skips per hour. But overall it is a good app."
"September 5, 2013","Awesome...Love it !!! One of the best Apps ever ... Fits my needs for great music just fine... Try it !!"
"May 1, 2016","Pandora will no work on my 5th Generation Kindle which is my 3rd Kindle. Can anyone tell me why it won't work ?"
"December 19, 2014","I have had to redownload this app several times because of malfunctions with the app, and my kindle no longer works correctly. I don't recommend this app, although I still have to use it to record songs for videos I make. -_-"
"May 1, 2013","I use the paid subscription to Pandora, which as far as I am concerned is the best value around. The take-it-with-you Android app works beautifully.  My only quibble is that it's hard to change your shuffle on the app, but whatever. It would be easier on a tablet, but for a mobile app, it's great. Thanks, Pandora-you're the best."
"June 8, 2017","Pandora play all the new songs that are out today and the ones I love"
"February 4, 2013","Love this app. You can select so many different channels and create your own preferred listening stations. Love love love it!"
"July 21, 2013","i love listening to music on my kindle and on my phone. its easy to chose what kind of music you want to listen too"
"December 10, 2012","I love Pandora for the option of listening to music at work. But I hate the new update! A few songs will play then the ""station"" freezes up & does not continue! Very frustrating! I refuse to pay for add free with this problem & if this issue continues will stop listening to this application and will choose a different more user friendly option."
"December 24, 2012","If you like music and making your own playlist then this is the app for you, you choose what you like to listen to."
"February 7, 2017","Nice to have Pandora"
"March 24, 2017","Great. I love it It is easy to get around and gets me my favorite music with barely any effort."
"May 21, 2017","love it"
"June 14, 2015","Free music is amazing because I hate to pay for things I don't need to like music surely get this app wham you have the chance it is amazing and I'm only 8 years old get the app NOW I rate it 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000."
"August 15, 2014","I just love Pandora, especially Pandora One! I play Pandora One all day long while I'm at work. I've chosen so many ""stations,"" and then I set Pandora One to ""scramble."" Love the music. Love the fact that, on Pandora One, I get no ads whatsoever. The price is incredibly reasonable, too."
"October 16, 2016","I've been pretty happy with most of my orders. Recently I ran into trouble with sizes being mismarked. Cost me time and $"
"May 5, 2017","The variety of music provided are excellent to me. Thank you."
"November 1, 2014","Pandora is my go to music app on my ipad, iphone and my laptop. I've come to notice the more skips I use, the more ads play, be wary of that."
"May 3, 2017","I love pandora couldn't wait to download it.."
"December 29, 2014","O.k."
"April 30, 2017","Love this app. Best music app. But I was listening to my favorite song and the app reset and I opened the app and it started with a different song 😭"
"June 16, 2017","Enjoy it so much"
"January 23, 2014","I listen to Pandora everyday. Pandora allows for me to stream it just about anywhere, from my phone, my T.V or my friend's computer. I love it!"
"January 31, 2017","Grandson and his parents were very happy with these items."
"May 6, 2014","I have never been happier. My grandson set it up for me on my desk top computer about 5 or 6 years ago and have embraced ever since. One of the primary reasons why I like it so much is that I have some control over what I may want to listen to. Definitely 2 thumbs up."
"August 17, 2017","This to me is the best music media on the internet."
"September 18, 2016","It came through just like from my computer, phone or TV. I love using it on my fire because it doesn't use data like my phone."
"May 15, 2017","Way too many commercials and auto fed songs not related to my specific artist."
"November 8, 2016","Most used app I have. Works great."
"January 10, 2017","What was once a great app starts to spiral downwards. The same music gets played again after an hour or 2. No variety in music anymore. When kindle screen goes dark the music stops. This has not happened before but now happens very frequently. Kindle needs to be on at all times for the app to play music."
"April 10, 2017","Love it, commercials are not too bad"
"November 20, 2015","I am listening to Pandora right now. As a matter of fact, I listen to it the entire time I am working on my computer. I love that I get to make up my own radio stations and put on whichever station I feel like listening to."
"February 25, 2017","Ok"
"July 26, 2015","I like it because if I'm running out of batteries then I can just shut my device off and it has a nice set up plus this should be for 8 yr Olds  and up in my opinion :)"
"October 9, 2013","I have Pandora on my phone, Pandora on my Pc and now Pandora on my Kindle Fire Hd. Does that say anything for this app? It is my fav music app. My kids can listen to the tween station, my man can listen to the Regional Mexicana station and I can rock it out!! So, yes this is an awesome app!!"
"April 29, 2017","I've discovered so much wonderful music with this simple app. Dozens of new CD's are in my collection thanks to Pandora. I do miss the link to I-Tunes, on occasion."
"July 26, 2016","I love Pandora! I haven't purchased it ,so I do get commercials, but they aren't long. Any song you can think of if at your fingertips!"
"May 2, 2016","Pandora is Great! Luv it. Don't have to have ear plugs to listen because because isn't a radio station! But may if I want for privacy. THANKS PANDORA :-)"
"January 30, 2013","I have Pandora on my phone, kindle and computer. I listen while reading, eating dinner and when working. if you have problems on your computer open a new engine ( mozilla or firefox) and only use fir Pandora. you wont ever get ""stuck "" or poor playback as others complained. I am going to the Bahamas soon and hope I can use Pandora there!"
"May 2, 2017","Love to listen to the music i grow up on"
"January 26, 2017","Turned out to be pretty good. Really learned my taste."
"September 7, 2017","It's not as good as prime. But I do get frustrated with prime that husband and I can't both use at same time. It's better though."
"November 10, 2011","I have been using Pandora since 2006 and I love the service, I have their app on every electronic device I own that supports it, highly recomended. I wouldn't have music if it weren't for Pandora."
"January 6, 2015","I'm a first time reader of Deborah Bladon, I'm in love with her, her characters and the Gone series! I feel alive again with renewed hope for love and lust! At least while I'm reading. I'm addicted and hopeful! Thanks for warming up what looks to be a very cold winter!"
"May 12, 2017","I can listen to all my old and new favorite songs!!!!!"
"May 8, 2012","Panodora is a really great app and plays po the music I want, but my advice to you would be not to ""like"" the songs you like, because it takes it seriously plays that song over and over again. I promise that if you listen to the song area times it will recognize that you like it and play it more frequently. It never plays the songs that you dislike ,though, and that's always a good thing:)"
"February 7, 2017","It's Pandora"
"April 29, 2017","Cannot handle all the ads."
"August 20, 2012","Once I Changed to Pandora One it has turned into one of my best and favorite apps. l love being able to call up almost any song or genre I want. I even got Tom Lender of Doctor Demento fame!"
"June 23, 2016","I wish it played more of the bands music on their station. ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok"
"November 24, 2014","Love Pandora. It's a great way to listen to music without downloading all of your mp3 songs. Doesn't take up near the space and you can change it up a bit really quickly."
"June 2, 2013","I love this app over Iheart Radio because of the shuffle, as well as it plays more songs that I adore more often than its competitor. But the only downside I have found is the 40 hour listening limit on mobile devices. I personally haven't had a problem with the ads, mainly because I don't skip songs. All-in-all, a good app."
"August 22, 2014","I'm not too big of a fan of the webview used for Pandora, at times it's slow and a bit frustrating to use compared to Spotify and others. That said, I still like the music discovery of Pandora as well as the comedy station that's on there."
"July 21, 2015","a great app! every thing works for free but you can upgrade and get another feature that gives u the unlimited availably to skip songs u do not want to hear. The free version only allows you to skip 4 or 5 per session."
"May 9, 2013","This app is amazing!!! I couldn't ask for better, why download costly songs when you can download a free app to listen to all your favorite songs without pay. That's pretty cool. The only bad thing is that you need Internet connection to use, and some of the songs are innapropriate. But otherwise...I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS APP (:"
"July 1, 2014","Pandora is imho the best music streaming app in the known universe. I use it at home, work and sometimes in my car. I love how it learns the music you like to listen to and suggests new music in the same genre. Give it a try, I think you'll like it."
"August 1, 2017","If Pandora didn't have so many commercials, then I'd love this app. But, Amazon Music is love for me. :)"
"January 4, 2014","I have been a Pandora subscriber for quite some time. I'm really pleased to have it for my Kindle Fire!!!"
"September 10, 2015","Good tunes, unlimited station setting possibilities great variety. Works on all my different devices (android, windows, blackberry). Love Pandora everywhere."
"July 31, 2015","it never works every time I try to download it just never works can u guys help me with this stuff please and how u can get the new songs kn their it just never works"
"June 17, 2013","Pandora is the greatest invention since FM radio. Rather than choosing a station based on what kind of music you like you now choose an artist you're in the mood to listen to and it never fails to satisfy. I love 80's hair bands for working out, jack Johnson for cooking, Chris daughtry for working and Abba by the pool."
"January 17, 2013","works very well except when you want to skips more than 6 song even if your subscribe to pandora one...they said you gonna be able to skip more but not...and i cant share my song with account of facebook . or twitter...have a error when you try to share..."
"June 19, 2015","This app enables me to listen to whatever I want to it rocks whoever doesn't like it is totally missing out on the fun it brings you on Friday night party's and random gigs!!"
"December 12, 2012","I love Pandora (and not just cuz I'm 11(I didn't change the User name) it gives a great verity and when I like songs, it remembers and plays them again it learns what you like. plus, I don't even see slacker radio on the ""top free"" section. so tut should prove that Pandora is better than slacker.(even though ive never listened to slacker)"
"July 20, 2012","Pandora is an incredible app to purchase! You can listen to any type of music you'd like! There is rock pop rap hip hop Adele Gotye Katy Perry and every one else in music history! Want to listen to ""Somethin' 'bout a truck"" by Kip Moore? just click on Today's Country and it will be there! Pandora is awesome and a great app to get and its even free! Get it today!"
"June 6, 2017","Great app for quick access to some old time favorites."
"April 15, 2012","this app is amazing! especially considering that it's free! I never have to buy music, I just make different channels, that I can adjust to my liking, and have playlists of songs that fit every mood. The occasional commercial, around one every 15 songs doesn't bother me, WHO CARES IT WAS FREE!!!!! ive never had problems with loading on my kindle fire or laptop. GET THIS APP!!! 5 stars."
"March 29, 2016","It always has such good music, and you can personalize the stations however you want! I really like Pandora!"
"January 4, 2013","The app doesn't play the whole song through, and it will just outright not play one after a failed advert didn't even play. You have to skip it. Please fix this app Pandora. I love the content but this app is awful. And even seeing as there have been quite a few complaints about the same problems, you don't seem to be in a hurry to fix it."
"November 9, 2011","Perhaps one of the best music services available. Pandora is a streaming music service that allows you to search for the music you like based off a particular song, artist, genre, etc. Pandora works by using the 3/4g connection of your phone or tablet. If that is not available it also can use wifi! This program takes the internet version and brings it into one small package perfect for the android market!"
"January 8, 2016","Pandora is a great compromise for streaming music. Although the free version has commercials, they are not that offensive or as frequent as the other streaming music of broadcast stations."
"November 9, 2016","sleep timer does not stop keeps going till battery is gone. does not not do that on my phone have not figured it out"
"December 28, 2016","I don't subscribe/pay for Pandora, so I listen to the version with ads. It works well, but can be a little glitchy when used on my phone."
"August 15, 2013","I Love Pandora! Its A Great App For People That Love Music....The Only Thing I Dislike About Pandora Is That You Can Only Change The Song On A Track Six Times... But Other Than That Its Great! I Would Rate It Four Stars Instead Of Five Just Because Of The Issue With Skipping The Track Only Six Times."
"November 9, 2015","Great app for pandora. I play it through a real set of speakers, so I get the full benefit."
"May 18, 2012","I used to love Pandora, but for the last several months I haven't been able to listen to an entire song. For a while it would only do this occasionally and so I put up with it. Now I'm lucky if I hear more than 30 seconds. I gave Pandora the benefit of the doubt and waited until the latest update... but still the same thing. I am uninstalling. Pandora has lost another customer."
"February 24, 2017","I started using Pandora only because it's integrated with Uber, to allow customers to choose what content they want when using the car service."
"August 11, 2017","I'm giving it a good because it works, but they send out these ratings way to soon to really test."
"November 21, 2012","I am an old man. 61 years old to be exact. I have always loved music, and the only way I knew to play it was by putting on a record, or as time went by, a compact disc. Pandora, when I finally discovered it, was a revelation. I could create my own stations...and suddenly my home was filled with Bach, Thomas Newman, Argo Part or when we had guests, an easy listening station. But slowly the app died. It would play one song and refuse to play another. This happened more and more frequently and I finally gave up and downloaded Songa. It works fine. Goodbye Pandora. ***5/23/13***I have returned to Pandora! They repaired the app. Sure, there are more commercials but that's ok. Try it, you can't beat the price. Few apps have given me greater enjoyment."
"September 25, 2017","I can get what I like to listen to."
"December 17, 2015","I love the music I hope thee is Christmas music I love just love the music in Pandora please let me get the music it is almazing"
"September 22, 2016","Love pandora but only have iphone 4 and within the past week will no longer play saying I need to update to iOS 8 which isn't an option for me."
"April 15, 2014","See I tried this app because my friend loves it. but once it download ed it would not accept me . I signed In and every thing but still did not accept me . I wish it would work . So far it's great for my friend but she has a iPad please fix thanks. :("
"March 1, 2015","find it very convenient! Our daughter is into dance, tap and ballet. We grew up with Irish Step dancing. With no Irish music on hand----------POW! lets try Pandora! That's all we needed at the time. Of course its great for all the other artists."
"May 30, 2012","this is by far the best radio station app ever. love it! you can create multiple stations and listen to the seperately or go on quick mix.  And for those of you who are rating this 1 star because of the adds, you do realize they have to pay to run this somehow. if you hate the adds so much, then pay the whole dollar a month to not have adds. this app is fantastic!"
"November 24, 2014","I love this app it gives me all the music i want and i can get any type of radio I want. and if you want to comment plz do!! it lets u do that too!! plus its free?! Yul get it without a doubt you'll love it!!!"
"December 26, 2016","great to listen to...works great with Alexa"
"March 12, 2013","If it weren't for the commercials I would have given 5 stars. I like that there are so many different stations to choose from. And the options to skip a song if you don't want to listen to it is nice. Also the thumbs up and thumbs down option is great. Especially when you don't like a song so it won't choose it at random later."

"December 5, 2012","This is a great app. I use it all the time! You can play games, go online, or read while it plays in the background, or if you just want to listen to music it's a good way to discover artists. It even has some preset stations like a pop fitness radio and a Christmas station. If you love listening to music all the time like me, get this app! :)"
"September 25, 2016","Have trouble with volume when playing through car audio system"
"June 13, 2013","As a past subscriber to XM Radio I was looking for a substitute for less cost. XM is just too much money unless you travel alot. Pandora fills the spot nicely. Its good on travel too if you have good internet service in your area of travel. I have not tried their premium service, but I am thinking about it."
"February 11, 2015","I LOVVVEE pandora with such a wide selection and so many genres why would I turn on the radio? But sometimes I do get stuck listening to the same songs but its easily fixed with a new station."
"October 24, 2016","Makes our workday go smoothly!"
"October 29, 2015","I've loved the Pandora radio for as long as it's been available. I would leave everything on my phone and just keep Pandora and be happy!"
"October 10, 2013","I absolutely love this app ....I can listen to any type of music I want to ...I can listen to new upbeat music and oldie music .....there for u should defenintly buy this app. :)"
"January 1, 2017","Well sometimes it'll glitch. But I love it! You can type in any Singer and add it to your station which is pretty cool. But it also gives you stations you mite like."
"December 29, 2016","I like that I was able to transfer all the stations from another deviceja to a new one with Amazon."
"March 23, 2016","After awhile I deleted it then when I tried to download it again It said Preparing Download for 2 days"
"November 7, 2014","Just the music I want to hear, when I wish to hear it, in a manner I want to hear it, on the device I choose to. What more could a music lover ask for? I'm thinking… I'll have an answer for this next selection."
"December 16, 2012","Pandora is great. It can create numerous stations of music to your selection. Such as pop/rock/Christmas/country etc. You can also search by artist ot songs.If your not the greatest at finding songs you like Pandora can surely help. The only thing I don't like about this app is that it requires wi-fi. Other than that it's a five star app!"
"August 10, 2016","I love being able to hear my favorite songs and artists when I want to"
"July 23, 2014","It is a great way to listen to music.It lets you create stations and like or dislike any songs.The only problem is that when you dislike or try to skip a song at the wrong time you get a annoying pop up that you have to respond to."
"January 18, 2013","Great app, I play Pandora around the house and depending on my mode I set the station and let it go."
"December 16, 2011","I have found Pandora the most veratile and dependable of all the music suppliers. I use it on my ethernet connected TV, my PC, my Android X2 and my Kindle. Artists available are most all that I have looked for. Plus you can buy a song or an album if you like. Their variety of artists used has introduced me to new groups that I otherwise might not have heard. A very well thought out program."
"August 13, 2012","There are way too many adds. Once in a while an add will come up saying Why adds and then explains. 10 times or more in a song you have too close out a mini add and if you miss the x it will take you to the company's website. So annoying!  It has a nice variety of songs on each channel that goes along with the genre of music you are listening to."
"May 19, 2016","I have enjoyed Pandora radio immensely. It has made my gym workouts much more fun and I can select the music to the mode or work out I have planed ."
"June 16, 2017","It's a helpful and I love the music and yea so thanks and yayayy"
"October 11, 2015","I love pandora it is my main source for listening to music. Right now I'm having a bit of a time signing in to pandora . Wish me luck!1"
"April 20, 2017","All the music I could want!"
"June 8, 2012","Won't play after being idle for a few minutes, I have to close the app and re-open it to get it started again. Multiple times I've had it randomly skip through all my channels when it's not on quick mix. I hate to complain about ads, but they seem to be getting longer and more often. At least make the ads different sometimes, it's always the same ads over and over."
"July 15, 2016","I love Pandora because no matter what kind of music you're into,you can get it on Pandora.I love old R&B and with Pandora I can plenty."
"February 9, 2015","this app is great and all because it's free music. But when I try to skip the song; not only does it not skip; it pops up an ad and I have to go to another station and back again to skip."
"October 9, 2012","I just got this app and I'm in love with maroon 5 the script neon trees and any other alternate band ...but sadly it just cut off and said ' sorry app has forclosed' or ' we are unable to play any more music under this station. please change stations' if this doesn't Starr to work in the next day ..DELETE! its a waiste if thatsvall its gonna do"
"March 27, 2016","This is one of my most used apps. I am a PandoraOne subscriber. The update disabled the app. It opened and played about a second. I reinstalled it but it didn't work until I restarted my Z30. Working great again!"
"February 21, 2012","people are saying that Pandora is declining, but i haven't experienced any problems that everyone is complaining about. my only issue is the commercials and they only come on like once an hour. the songs never stop randomly and pandoda is still working fine fkr me. if you're having a problem with Pandora, either suck it up and deal with it or use something else like iHeartRadio."
"August 1, 2015","It let's you pick your groups, and any song you do not like, can be changed (stopped) to something you should like ( only so many times though), that is the only part that needs to be changed! But this is totally free, which is quite nice!"
"July 14, 2016","Great, but can quickly use up data"
"February 2, 2016","need. too listing for my mind body and soul and pray read my Bible every day and I love it so should you"
"August 15, 2017","Love it!"
"February 11, 2012","Pandora is awesome! If I'm cleaning up around the house or hosting a slumber party for my little sister, Pandora always has the best stations to choose from. Today's Hits radiois hands-down my favorite. Its better than 92.5 or 93.3 on the real radio stations. Choose Pandora now if you love music and you think that stopping every 3 minutes to put a new song on youtube is insane!"
"June 13, 2016","Really enjoy the tunes and there are less commercial interruptions than before."
"June 15, 2012","I love this app. very limited commercials. if you are planning to get I heart radio get this instead. one problem you may dislike though is the ads and you only can skip 6 times an hour. I like how you can skip like three times and it will play a different song. you also can go to a particular type of person. for example, you can go to the selena Gomez station."
"January 30, 2016","Great selections of the type of music I like! A few to adds but they need to get paid for a free site to use!"
"September 4, 2015","Would rather listen on my nice home system, but the mobile version is a must have; should be one of the first apps one downloads to new phone."
"August 31, 2017","Love to hear my oldie's music."
"June 13, 2016","as advertised. Hard to give any free app more than 4 starts. I love it though."
"October 12, 2017","Great variety of music"
"October 28, 2012","on the ipod if you bookmarks a track you can go to another feature on it and listen to all the songs you've bookmarked. on the kindle you bookmarks something and nothing really happens it just says track bookmarked or the songs name bookmarked. please make another update so we can listen to songs we bookmarks. wow I said bookmarks a lot:)"
"December 14, 2015","best app ever for music it puts out most bad words and can háve all most all stations u want so get it its good"
"July 22, 2012","ok this app is so amazing! u people that gave it any less than 5 stars are blind! this app is great for parties or u just want to jam!! yes the commercials are annoying sometimes but if u could just look past all that u would see the beautiful app that is Pandora!!!!! definitely a must-have app for all music lover's and definitely worthy of five stars!!"
"November 16, 2016","Love Good Music."
"December 22, 2012","Nice job of permitting selection/rejection of desired music. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. There!"
"May 25, 2014","I like Pandora because you can choose the songs, artists, genre, etc. that you most enjoy. You even have the choice of liking or not a particular arrangement of a favorite song. Very helpful in providing background music while working."
"August 28, 2016","Great selection of a variety of types and styles of music."
"July 11, 2016","too many ads, and the company is way to political. Screw you pandora."
"March 6, 2016","Can't pick specific songs ... Volume is inconsistent... OK ... But not nearly as good as Spotify"
"December 30, 2016","The app itself has a great layout and it functions fine most of the time. The only real issue I see is that the app continues to crash at random points while I'm listening to my music. While this is an issue I hope gets fixed quickly, I don't think you shouldn't get it just for that reason. The music plays fine and it goes on for a good hour or so before shutting off. I rate this 4/5 only because of that one problem."
"August 17, 2013","I love music and Pandora makes it really easy to listen to the music I love. Where else can I get my BB King fix while I exercise at the gym? Okay, so every once in a while I have to listen to a commercial, so what? On typical broadcast radio there are many, many more commercials and the music generally is....(can I say this?) crap!  Another great feature is that I can listen to Pandora at home on my Roku."
"September 12, 2014","Originally, when I reviewed Pandora I gave it one star due to too many commercials. Since I've gotten my Echo I noticed that problem has greatly improved! Pandora listened and now the commercials are manageable."
"January 7, 2014","I love the fact that you dictate what kind of music you want. I listen to everything so I can have separate stations made up with whatever mood I'm in for the day. I have my workout music on one station and I don't have to worry about skipping thru the songs."
"August 25, 2012","Pandora is such a great app on KF, been using it for awhile now it is really outstanding how selective playlists can be organized for your pleasure. Only complaint is when are you pushing their latest update on Amazon app store, it is available now on Google play don't know why Amazon takes ages for updates on Android apps which are already out."
"July 15, 2016","The only flaw is the loading and amount of skips on certain song's."
"June 24, 2013","its ok but if u type in the song you want to hear you wont even get to hear it. plus if you type in the artist you willnget other artists not even in the same genre. I reccomend the app tune In although you cant listen to the song you want you can listen to radio stations worldwide plus its free"
"August 7, 2013","Pandora free is good until the commercials get in there. I just had, literally not joking, a Dyson commercial pop up every time I skipped a song. I skipped six songs in a row and what do you know a 30 second Dyson commercial every time I skipped. I saw that commercial at least six times."
"January 12, 2012","I cant understand why there are so many negative reviews of this app it may not have occurred to some people that your network might have something to do with song skipping and force closure. This is a great app I have it on four different devices. Never had anything but stellar service on 3g 4g or wi-fi. My wife and kids love this app as well. I would give ten stars if I could."
"July 18, 2015","I been using the app for 5 yrs now and still running strong. After using it for time I I'll buy the full version with out commercial it's a good app"
"September 7, 2012","Pandora was a pain, so was using I Heart. Since the update, so much better. Easier to navigate, lists the lyrics, love the selection of stations and music. Created a station I love. But if you are looking for more eclectic artists and to discover new tunes, stick with I Heart. Also love if there's a song I hate,I never have to hear it again."
"October 8, 2012","The absolutely best music service available. I am introduced to new music based on my preferences and also hear my favorites from a variety of genres. Very little repetition through the week and somehow the algorithm they use manages to intuit what type of music I might like at night or on a weekend vs. mid-week. I just love Pandora!"
"December 8, 2014","Pandora. is a really good app but the one thing I do not like is the stations for.example I create a beyonce station and it plays a bunch of others artists songs but other than that its great"
"July 26, 2012","I like it even though there are some repetitive ads. (whats up with that kroger one?) And that sometimes songs I dont like come on but I am a big fan of the thumbs up and down thing. That is very helpful. Overall I like this app although I am still pondering over the fact that I type in the fray and get a country song. But I still love this app.."
"March 31, 2013","I don't use these type of apps often because I have over 50000 songs in my cloud, but when I do use Pandora on my Kindle Fire HD, it works most times. Seems to stop playing after a few hours though and has commercials. When I use on my LG home theater (built into that) it never plays commercials and never quits until I turn it off. Not bad though for a free music radio. I tend to use Songza more often on the Fire HD then this one though."
"March 30, 2012","I like Pandora a lot because I love listening to music and whenever I gotta work or do stuff, I just listen to it. I can make new stations and if I don't like a song, just put thumbs down. But it's kinda annoying how they have the same old commercials over and over again. They should try to put other commercials as well, or not at all. I prefer no commercials :)"
"June 10, 2013","Being one that is very picky when it comes to music providers, I surprisingly loved Pandora. They have every variety of music genres. The only thing I do not like is your limited on songs you can skip and you have to pay in order to not have advertisements. But they have to make money some way."
"November 28, 2015","This app is amazing because you can listen to your favorite music and, you could also hi on a run at the same time."
"February 9, 2016","Don't enjoy the concept of signing into an app on my BlackBerry. Was not working well w the z 30."
"August 29, 2016","Perfect Free Radio, i listen to it all dayat work. Easy dashboard. Subscription well worth it to get radio witout commercial interruptiin.Try new bands without spending money"
"March 17, 2014","I love the way you can make your own personal stations but I don't like how you have to create an account and you have to have wifi to play music. but if you have wick and don't mind creating a free account then get this app it is satisfying."
"November 21, 2016","Veryha"
"March 2, 2016","It is great because sometimes I just want to listen to music and this is the place to do it."
"May 23, 2016","Super simple and responsive to my likes in tailoring channels just for me."
"October 2, 2013","Gotta love Pandora. So fun to gave music when and where ever you want . The commercials aren't terrible either"
"November 6, 2016","Good"
"July 19, 2017","I love it!!"
"May 13, 2015","A great feature of this app was the alarm. I've been waking up to music since the alarm was added. No more. It no longer works after the last update. Please fix."
"April 23, 2013","I love Pandora and have been listening to it almost daily. I have most of my 100 station allotment already in use! I love the shuffle feature and the variety of music that gives me. I have pandora going in my home from morning till dinner time. I think that the annual membership is a great price."
"December 27, 2015","I love this because it has fetty wap and all my favorite music and song and it has Justin timberlake <3"
"October 20, 2016","love it"
"September 2, 2015","Unfortunately after installing a popup appears on launch stating the service is not available in my country (Canada). C'est la vie."
"October 14, 2017","It love it"
"December 4, 2012","I really used to love this app but recent updates have made my kindle fire unstable and the ads have been regularly crashing the app. Also, the ads have become more frequent. I could probably deal with if they worked properly and music would resume after they finished. Until this is fixed, I cannot recommend this app."
"December 21, 2012","I can play the artist I like. Being a 1940s' guy I can get the big band music I enjoy and the vocalist of the 40s' singing music that you can actually understand."
"April 18, 2014","I love Pandora it gives me a lot of variety. of course there are some advertisements but not so many that you cannot enjoy the music. would recommend"
"June 2, 2014","I love Pandora I think its a very very cool and you will love this app on the app store.,....................................................!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"October 11, 2012","I love this app, its the best internet radio on the internet! No other app gives you the amount of versatility that Pandora does, I love Christian music and no other radio gives u the amount of artists that I have found on Pandora! Very little amount of commercials. Thank you Pandora for giving us Free Radio that is the best!!!"
"May 17, 2017","This is just what it should be!"
"September 8, 2014","Another app not compatible with FIRE TV, this is getting old. Why oh why is NOTHING cool compatible with FIRE TV????"
"October 12, 2017","Short of five stars only because of the constant streaming interruptions."
"August 8, 2013","I love this app! in fact i listen to Pandora on my computer as well, however this app has been crashing alot lately! It will just stop when i'm listening or will say it had an error and needs to close. Hopefully the next update will fix this. I am using this app on my HTC Rhyme"
"October 15, 2017","Can't make your own music list. Stuck with stations, like IHeart radio!"
"March 17, 2014","Pandora offers an Internet radio that is specifically designed for you! Pandora lets you pick out your Fave artists genres and even a specific song. Pandora will find things related to that!!! LOVE IT WAY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER STATION!!!"
"July 29, 2016","Love pandora and all the stations they have. I had a paid Subscription for awhile but cancelled it. The ads really aren't that annoying."
"March 11, 2017","Cool music app i like it so 😎😎  😎"
"February 20, 2016","I love that I can listen to the genre of music I like. The songs are tailored to my favorite artists."
"August 6, 2017","I really enjoy listening to many stations on this app. My only comp!ain't is hearing some of the sleazy advertisements that are riske and rude."
"February 22, 2015","every on if u read this then u know that this is a good app because it gives u free music to listen to on the road or just in your house with free music when ever u want"
"December 7, 2016","Amazing source for music"
"February 22, 2017","always loved Pandora!"
"August 15, 2016","Stupid app wouldn't let me register. Nonfunctional"
"August 23, 2015","I love this app, the only downside is the skips limit. We have Pandora one, so we pay for it. But we still have a skip limit."
"August 9, 2016","i could live without commercials and limit of skips"
"February 27, 2012","I'm a musician, and I've tried Internet Radios before, but this one is by far my favorite. I don't see why people are complaining, everything it plays is based off the information you give the program. The only thing I'm left wishing for is being able to see the lyrics like you can on the we site. But other than that, this is definitely worth the download."
"May 12, 2014","is a great app for adults and kids to listen all types of music but the only problem is that when you want to change from radio station stock and you cant changed and have to wait until done the last song that you listening"
"July 8, 2013","I just got a new kindle and re downloaded everything and Pandora so many new limits it sucks so bad like only 40 hours free mobile listening and only 6 skips total per day what happened to 6 skips per station per day uuuuuuugggggggghhhhhhh Pandora used to be my favorite music app"
"December 26, 2016","best variety of music comedy even some podcasts. I have been a fan of Pandora radio for years never gets old, love it! 😜"
"January 22, 2012","What can I say about Pandora. It's always been fair about paid and free subscriptions. The free version is a great marketing tactic. It keeps the name brand up and for those that pay like I have in the past, it's awesome with awesome features. I'm currently running the free one again due to finances but I still enjoy the great service Pandora has to offer."
"May 20, 2014","This is an awesome app you can get your own music! This has nothing to do with this app but thee one thing that I hats is that the kindle makes thou put in a rule about how many words you can have when you write a review."
"July 24, 2017","Lol love it"
"August 10, 2017","Nice"
"July 18, 2016","Love the praise and worship music .Would like to hear"
"January 7, 2017","Really great selection"
"September 20, 2016","Was ok for a while. IT was free to begin with, then you had to pay. You can listen to other stations without paying."
"February 29, 2012","Pandora is a great radio station!I listen to music everyday on Pandora!There's always good music on Pandora!You can pick the music you like and the music you don't like.This is a cool radio station,and the best radio station ever made!Awesome radio station ever!GREAT APP EVER MADE IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!:);):);):);):);)!!!!!!!!!!!GET IT!!!!!"

If not your missing out on your favorite kind of music! Plus, so many songs!! Create your free account today and upgrade it to Pandora One and monthly subscribe!"
"July 13, 2016","I have been a loyal subscriber to Pandora for several years. My reoccurring subsicription ends on 8/6/2016, and will not be renewed.  Pandora's support of Black Lives Matter is very short sighted. BLM, while probably started with good intentions, has morphed into a terrorist organization. All Lives Matter, not just black lives. Any company, business, or group supporting BLM should be avoided."
"October 25, 2013","This is so cool iam a hold out on most stuff I want to make sure something works the way it is ment to before I put it on a device and this really does just that it works and works great"
"February 4, 2016","Love Pandora at our business. We are a Massage Health Center and it works beautifully"
"February 13, 2016","I guess it is ok but if you are hoping for a really good music app go to iheartradio"
"December 3, 2016","Music from my past brings back sweet memories.. Don't care for most of the music of today. Puts me in charge of my picks."
"August 12, 2015","it dosent let me make comments after a sertain amount and i hate that it is soooo stupid.how comunicate with my friends?????"
"November 12, 2014","love this app it lets you ""sing along"" to pretty much anything. also saves your fav type of music.LOVE IT!!!! so I totally recomened for every one to get this FREE app."
"May 16, 2016","I love Pandora!!! Listen every day - I can't live without it!"
"October 22, 2014","pandora is great to play all my fav music. It could be better by while playing the music it you can see the music videos. I'm not a great fan of IHeart because it keep cutting me out."
"January 30, 2017","Love pandora"
"September 20, 2017","I love Pandora and its great music and so does my grandkids"
"May 20, 2013","pandora is a really cool game for music you can pick any radio station you want, learn about the singer and see lyrics. also if you don't like a song u can hit thumbs down and it will never play it again. I love this app but the only thing I hate is that you can't pick your song."
"June 26, 2015","Finally, the Pandora app through Amazon apps on Blackberry Z10! Works great no more going through the browser and getting kicked out."
"December 11, 2012","Pandora WAS awesome and rated 5 stars, UNTIL the most recent update. Now it freezes up my Kindle Fire every few song and that makes it virtually unusable. It will remain a 1 star until they fix the 'improvements'."
"February 22, 2017","free radio station which I can listen and play games. High quality music for free."
"December 17, 2013","On my kindle fire it skips the last half of the song a lot and pauses randomly, its not that I have bad internet connection because I had all bars. Glitch of some sort but other than that it plays music by the same artist and artists like it."
"June 18, 2014","Great app. I can listen to a variety of music similar to one of my favorite bands. I also added other favorite bands for a fantastic mix of music. Have been finding bands I like that I've never heard of too."
"November 13, 2016","I truly enjoy Pandora!"
"June 20, 2012","I love pandora! I use it on my kindle fire and on my laptop with the website. I don't really understand why other people r having so much trouble it whilst it is simple to use. the commercials that come w/ the free one r small and don't bother w/ the song. <3 dat u can do other stuff like web surfing while listening to pandora"
"September 22, 2012","I love Pandora! I use it all the time and it provides a great selection of music unlike the radio which repeats constantly. A bunch of people say they don't like it because of the adds; but there is a thirty second or less add every five or more songs; so that is not a good complaint. I give it five stars completly!"
"September 25, 2014","i used to love it but now it seems that when I hit thumbs up I never here the song again and it never plays songs related to the songs I like just irrelevant songs and songs I don't like"
"November 6, 2012","This delivers music with very little ads. But music that YOU pick, you ""like"" and you might not yet know, but may grow to love. It's free content for the cost of listen to an ad or two every five or six songs and REALLY free if you use it over wi-fi and not on your limited data plan smart phone. So much fun!"
"December 14, 2016","I love not having to listen to commercials, skipping all the music I don't want to listen to. This is a good deal."
"June 3, 2012","Pandora is amazing I always have it on my Tv when I'm cleaning or just wanna listen to music . my life basically revolves around music so I would so recommend this to people who love listening to music! you can create ur stations nd sometimes find songs u never thought u will like, I love it && I'm positive u will too :)"
"March 7, 2012","I dunno why everyone here is saying it sucks on the kindle fire. Its awesome on the KF and the music comes out very clearly and smoothly. I've never had to deal with a force close with Pandora and although commercials do occur they are not as constant as many people lead first-time Pandora users to believe. Do not fall to the lies children!!!"
"September 4, 2013","After adding artists I can listen to many different genres of music....and so like the feature that tells me why they chose a particular song, or how it is like the music of the artists I have selected"
"November 16, 2012","The android app doesn't let you create new stations from a song currently playing, among other functionality present in the web version. Also songs take a long time to load sometimes, which is annoying, I don't like having gaps of silence between songs. Other than that I like the Pandora Android App a lot!"
"January 3, 2017","It doesn't work"
"January 2, 2017","very good"
"April 15, 2012","Pandora is so much better than the iheart radio app. it is simple. fun. and when I want to makemy own radio all i have to do is type one song that I like and then it is like it reads my mind because it gives me all of my fav. songs. amazing. if you have a doubt about buying this app don't. it is totally worth it. makes me feel so good."
"January 23, 2017","LOVE it."
"January 8, 2013","I love this app. it can get a little glitchy at times but for the most part runs smoothly. if I do have trouble with a station I just switch the station or restart the app. its a great companion for when I get bored of the music I have. nice way to learn of new artists. I definitely reccomend it."
"June 27, 2016","Great way to listen to music while on my Kindle."
"September 3, 2014","I think that this is a great app I have it on all of my electronics and it has all different types of music for all different types of people I love this app and I think you should get it."
"May 15, 2012","it is a good app and has new and current music (I should know from being a teenager) but the only problem is that it only allows you to use 6 skips per hour per station :( ugh that makes me mad cause there could be a song that was made in the 70's and I cant skip it. but overall, its a good app :)  Jesus loves ya""ll"
"August 1, 2015","Pandora is great because you can listen to music whenever you want! While you listen to the music it's easier to do work."
"January 25, 2017","love it"
"March 24, 2013","love pandora took some time for it to get a good mix going. would never go back now love it!!!!"
"July 18, 2012","this app is awesome. works with Pandora online and you can sync so your stations online are available on kindle. needs confirmation that you are still listening about every 3-4 hours. stays on without screen so you can listen longer or at night. does have ads play but it's maybe a couple an hour. small price to pay"
"December 21, 2011","Interesting that this free radio is called ""pandora"". . . . It is a box full of music of every genre you can imagine. I have Pandora on my home and work computers, my android phone, and now my Kindle Fire! If you go over your minutes for the month, it only costs you $0.99 to continue the ""free"" music. You won't be sorry if you download the app."
"December 3, 2013","Love the music on this app..I would highly recommend it. Its free and no one can beat free lol. YAY"
"January 20, 2014","I just love it. I listen to pandora all day at work better than regular radio sations that play the same music over and over i hate listening to regular radio..pandora is the best next thing, i love itunes but it could be pricey."
"June 22, 2015","Pandora has terrible customer service. No phone help. Constantly changes songs within a category and leaves no way to track it."
"January 2, 2014","I really enjoy Pandora. The ability to create or choose channels is outstanding. It is also on my Xfinity cable service. My channels go from light classic to smooth jazz, folk,blues and even opera. I wish I could get it in my car..."
"August 7, 2015","It always skip the music without me hit skip. Then it would say 'ran out of music, try another station' Don't get it"
"February 21, 2016","Why would any one not like this? Free portable music. 😂 thank the hevens"
"June 19, 2014","It has to much advertising and you have to pay 0.99 and I cant even get a Amazon gift card and you don't select any songs and I tap the play button 20 times and no song plays this is why Pandora sucks"
"November 2, 2013","This app is great and all but sometimes I notice it skips songs. I look to see what song is playing and I see in frount of that song is one of my favorite songs was played before this song and I'm positive I would know when my song is played."
"December 12, 2014","I love Pandora. This is the reason I bought blue rays for all my tv's and why I bought more gigs for my cell phone. I listen to Pandora all day and sometimes during the night."
"November 23, 2015","This is worth the 4.99 a month I love the variety of music to select from and no commercials"
"January 10, 2017","love it!"
"November 21, 2016","I love Pandora!"
"April 12, 2013","Pandora is solo cool. I get to listen to one direction,Austin mahone,Cody simpson,and even btr. the only thing I would change the number of skips. only six. ya I wud bump it up to like 10 or something like that:) but other than that its EXTRORDINHARRY!ya I'm on a role guys :)"
"July 26, 2012","Thanks to Pandora, I have been introduced to a whole new world of music! It takes what songs you've liked, then finds other similar songs. I've found so many great songs due to this app. I don't know why people are saying that it forces closed, this hasn't ever happend to me and I've had the app for a while now."
"December 5, 2013","this app is the best. Just put in a song you like and it will play that song & songs similar to it. You can create lots of stations - pick some of their own/hardly Any commercials - just a very cool way to rock out to tunes. Love it"
"July 26, 2014","I like having goof music at my finger tips at all times. you can get that song that you are looking. for an find some you may have never heard ever. GOOD MUSIC FROM PANDORA FIVE STAR REVIEW."
"July 20, 2015","I think this is so awesome. because Pandora is such a good thing for kids to hear when they are scared. (serious)"
"April 10, 2015","Love this app. I have it on all of my phones, tablets, home and work computer it goes where I go and make life that much better for me!!!!!"
"June 10, 2014","I downloaded this application for my Kindle to play while I'm at work. There's such a broad range of different music specifically for my taste. The songs play more clearly than my radio in work which tends to fade in and out because of being in a high office building. I would recommend this application to people of all ages."
"December 23, 2015","So I had Pandora I tried to log in again but it says my password and email is fake."
"November 25, 2016","Is good"
"January 21, 2015","this is my jam I love how I can just put in a name like future and I love how you can skip but I hats the skips are limited ya know I just hate don't you"
"October 19, 2015","I love Pandora it is amazing whenever I'm sick I listen to it in bed I really recommend this app"
"September 19, 2013","Best radio app. It has lots of nice genres, songs, artist, you name it, it has it! I barely get any ads on my Kindle and even if there were, it was short. But I don't mind having the ads if I know I will get some nice free songs to listen to."
"February 15, 2016","This app worked on my old Kindle but there is no volume on my new one"
"October 8, 2015","It keeps coming up on my phone without asking! I can't get rid of it unless I shut my phone off!!"
"March 6, 2014","I LONE THIS APP!!! this is a FREE music app. great music, thousands of stations to chose from and it has a sleep timer and an alarm clock feature. I recommend this app for anyone that wants a good mobile music app."
"March 16, 2016","Doesn't play. Just shows song information. Very disappointing."
"April 21, 2015","You should get it if you like music!AWESOMESAUCE!Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome!Get it get it get it get it!recommend"
"October 25, 2014","Pandora was found when I was looking for a particular musician. Phil Keaggy to be specific. Paul McCartney identified Phil as the world's greatest classical guitarist a number of years ago, and the amazing thing about Keaggy is that he only has nine fingers! Anyway, I found Keaggy's music on Pandora and have been listening ever since!"
"October 12, 2012","Pandora has been my number one app since my first smart phone. I have discovered so much new music with this service. I can listen on my computer, on my Roku, on my phone, and on my Kindle Fire HD. I've been a Pandora One subscriber for the last two years and it is the best $30 I spend each year."
"May 31, 2013","Pandora is nice way to bye the time away while your waiting. Plus its free music, youcan listen to almost anywhere, and yup can listen any song you want. I reccomend this because theirs music you could share with your family and more.  Hope you like it."
"December 23, 2014","I enjoy making my own station with a variety of music I like. I enjoy the workout stations too. I have been jamming to Christmas music the last two weeks!"
"April 14, 2012","It really needs better songs the one they put on know are bad and old u hear if about a billion songs they never put on the songs that are new like rumor has it or boyfriend or one direction or anything new you will probably heat songs from more then 5 or 6 years ago but some songs might be ok. So I would so its a ok app!!!"
"March 18, 2015","I would give this five stars but if I type in the name of a song it would be nice to hear that song or at least songs by the same musicians."
"December 15, 2014","So easy to customize your own listening experiences! Even with all the adds, it's a great app for my Kindle Fire!"
"September 7, 2017","Need tunes for my car and Pandora provides. Even with only a free account I can get all the music I want. Occasional ads aren't so frequent that it bugs me."
"January 31, 2012","this app loads nicely and is very easy to navigate. it's great to listen to music while reading to drown out distracting noises like the tv. create multiple artist or group radio stations and enjoy the music. it even has a shuffle function. the ads are short and far in between so not a nuisance at all. love, love, love this app."
"December 18, 2014","keeps cutting out when I'm in the middle of workouts. Very annoying! Also there are more and more ads! Will be switching to my own playlists on phone memory"
"June 5, 2012","This app works great on my Kindle Fire. The Pandora App will keep playing music in the background while you read, which is nice. I was able to easily able to log into my existing Pandora account and access my stations. It was also easy to create new stations using this app. No problems here and a nice addition to my Fire."
"January 14, 2014","I never really used it but I like Pandora I use it all the time on my phone. Awesome app"
"June 1, 2016","Pandora is a great link to a radio program."
"April 13, 2013","There is a 40 hour limit to listening to the music on this app. I ran out of time in 3 days. I don't want to pay to upgrade so I'm stuck. That's the bad news the good news is that Pandora plays music that os completely tailored to me!!! This is one of my favorite apps"
"March 2, 2015","I love Pandora. I use it for rain music for my massage sessions. BUT.... Four stars because I am still limited in skips even as a paying user."
"November 23, 2015","I love Pandora, i love to listen to the Christmas songs and , Southern Gospel songs.."
"May 26, 2015","It's good but when I turn on allow explicit content it says changes made, but all the songs are still clean. Fix that please"
"December 26, 2013","I got this app because I always use Pandora on my other devises when I am useong that device some of my kids use it. I do like this app i only gave it 4 stars because it is kinda hard to navigate this app on the Kindel Fire."
"September 11, 2017","Not very easy to call up the artist (s) that I like. Could be easier but still cuts out the music that I don't care for. Radio bombards me with hours of blech for a few that I would choose. I'll keep it and maybe get better at manipulating it"
"September 5, 2012","I use this app every day. I love it. earlier I got a new update. this update has much more than before. now Ill use it whenever possible."
"May 19, 2012","I love the Pandora service, whenever I can I'm listening to Pandora One, it provides me with the music I like that I cant find anywhere else and provides a constant tune to my life. I have discovered many fantastic artists and listened to well over 2000 hours, thanks Pandora for providing such an amazing service :)"
"July 30, 2017","The free version is okay easy to make playlist"
"October 24, 2016","Love Pandora!"
"August 5, 2017","Good."
"November 3, 2014","it plays what you what and you can skip songs you don't like and if there are songs you are not alowed to buy/lisen to you can get your own account too I love it"
"September 19, 2012","I have been a Pandora fan for quite a while and I absolutely hats their new format. That is why I have given it a 2 star rating. It plays fine on the Kindle Fire. I just can't access my favorites or anything. Will be finding me another radio channel until Pandora gets this crape straightened out."
"August 1, 2017","Pandora is always good...I love it! 😍"
"April 28, 2017","Listen to it every day. Use the genres feature and listen to NEW AGE BEATS on my obsolete SONY DASH!"
"June 28, 2015","It should be for all age cause everyone love to listen to songs, cause it makes them be who they want to be"
"July 9, 2013","Often I like music, but can't identify the artist. This app allows me to do that. In addition, it provides me with ""like"" artists; music of the same genre or by the same artist which I would not necessarily seek out. I love these features."
"January 6, 2017","I would rather choose just the artist I select...rather than Pandora choosing other artists they think I might like to hear too."
"February 17, 2014","I read a lot of the reviews for Pandora and thought I finally found the music app made just for me. it looked amazing. Apparently, its not available in all countrys, and my country happens to be one of them. :("
"April 11, 2015","it is awesome I love this app you need to get it it is a must have I have had this app forever and never got sick or tiered of it"
"March 2, 2015","This radio is a piece of crap I have a email account and poopdora wouldn't let me play I would give it negative infinity stars if I could"
"July 19, 2012","I adore Pandora! Every day I meet new talented artists I have never encountered before since creating listening stations as diverse as Early Latin Jazz to New Age Instrumental and Liz Story to Bluegrass. What a delight to find music appropriate for the holiday seasons, too. Thank you, Pandora!"
"December 21, 2011","Pandora is the best of the radio applications. It is free and works very well, even in the car!  Anyone I have shown this application to has been very impressed and installed it immediately. Congratulations on a job well done to the makers of Pandora. As a reward, I signed up for Pandora One. Look into it. You won't be sorry."
"November 10, 2017","Great app and you can't beat the price"
"October 6, 2012","What more can I say? I love Pandora for the music varieties it provides. I am not much a station hopper, so once I set the type of music, mostly classical, the numbers of music come through are satisfying. Furthermore, the quality of sound is impecable - it is definitely one of my favs."
"August 25, 2013","I downloaded this app for my kindle fire. When I opened it nothing happened. I tried deleting it and re-downloading it - it still did not work. It just shows the opening Pandora screen and never does anything else. Just a tad bit annoying!"
"August 7, 2015","Won't let me play music for some unknown reason and if I could give zero stars I would. This app sucks"
"July 11, 2016","Same old stuff all the time"
"June 21, 2017","Still love Pandora after all these years."
"December 15, 2013","I used to love this app so much until the newest update, it makes me feel uncomfortable and has lost many main features such as the sleep timer. :("
"May 17, 2017","Not sure how this popped up on my list, Cleared it out."
"November 11, 2012","This app is so awesome! U can listen 2 any music u want 2. So u would type in the kind u like.(I like pop) Then just listen. But I had trouble turning of the music at first. so what u do is u have 2 go 2 the little box with 3 white boxes in it and select quit. Best app Eva!!!!!! :-D"
"March 7, 2013","I have been using Pandora for months to listen to music at work. I didn't care that there were advertisements since it was free. Now they are limiting the free music to 40 hours per month. I will find a new app for listening to music at work. I'm very disappointed."
"November 23, 2014","I love this app because its free music! Who doesn't love free music! I suggest this app for everyone! I would not waste your time getting this App"
"September 12, 2017","Works good."
"April 5, 2017","listen all the time ,prefer music with no words, love it !!!"
"September 30, 2012","I love listening to this while I work in the kitchen or am just hanging out. I've also discovered some new artists that I've never heard of before due to the stations playing similar music to artists I already like. I highly recommend. There are commercials, but not too often. Thumbs up."
"February 25, 2016","I love it. pick your own music and its free!!!!!!!!!!!"
"August 17, 2013","This is a great app. But, it would be even better if you could keep listening to the same song over and over again. That is why I just gave it 4 stars. Sometimes it doesn't work, though. Otherwise it is the best music app in my opinion."
"December 22, 2015","I love this app it just plays songs without you having to select one"
"December 30, 2014","Want a free music app that plays your favorite artists and songs? Pandora is great for you. One catch.... you need wifi like most other apps."
"December 25, 2014","This app is horrible I hate it. You can barely get past the front screen I'm a kid. I don't have an email!!!THE WORSTððð"
"June 24, 2016","I use it daily I love it."
"November 19, 2012","LOVE Pandora. It is a great way to hear your favorite artists but also learn about new artists and tracks that are very similar. I listen to it when I work out...my favorite station is Pit Bull. And when I am in the bath...favorite station is 2 Chellos. It rocks! Literally."
"February 17, 2016","I love Pandora , listen all the time on my kindle fire"
"December 10, 2012","I loved this app until recently. the video advertisements freeze the app if you aren't actually on the app. think they are trying to make you physically watch the commercials. happens all too often for a person who works with their hands constantly. iheartradio hear I come."
"August 12, 2013","It is so wonderful to listen to music I love, the words I can hear and even sing along.....the best part I choose the music and it is there for me....always. I have heard songs that I have not heard in YEARS!!! The best part it is FREE!!!!"
"May 13, 2012","this is a great app and all but the one thing it is missing is viewing the bookmarks. there is absolutely no options to view your bookmarks. I want to check out the songs and artists that I bookmarked but sadly I can't. Please Pandora fix this issue on your app in order to make this app great again."
"September 4, 2014","great way to enjoy personalized music. you pick what you like and don't like and it customizes itself to you like a well tailored outfit. nothing can beat this."
"December 10, 2013","Pandora is horrible!! Its slow!! It laggggs really bad. I wanted to purchase Pandora 1 but its not worth the $4 a month to listen to silence!!"
"March 6, 2016","I like it, but not enough to buy a subscription."
"December 25, 2013","I don't know how many time I've remove Pandora from my kindle only to reinstall it. Of course, after reinstall it works but I shouldn't have to uninstall it for it to work. Idk, maybe it this darn kindle fire."
"July 8, 2015","it shows you many cool songs on the app and it is a cool for parties I really like this app so try it"
"September 16, 2017","I thought it was a radio station, can't navigate it at all."
"December 1, 2013","I recommend you get this app for all your music needs. works perfectly no problems what so ever. has all of my favorite songs.even the ones I don't here on the raido any more. is also great for kids. get this app."
"September 10, 2012","This app is just fine. I really don't see why people are so negative. It plays my music uninterrupted without problem. Who cares if it plays the same advertisement over and over? It isn't after every song like other reviewers said. Don't read the negative reviews. Try it for yourself."
"October 1, 2015","I think this app is the best app ever that I have ever had I like to listen to mgk"
"December 7, 2014","PANDORA IS AWESOME BECAUSE YOU GET TO LISTEN TO HOT SONGS LIKE BLANK SPACE BY TAILOR SWIFT.PANDORA IS AMAZING!!!!!! 100% +AMAZING=AWESOME"
"December 31, 2014","If you don't upgrade and pay for it, the music is intermittent even if you're not on any other sites at the same time. Poor quality!"
"April 26, 2013","I love the music choices, but I think its stupid how we have to pay for it after a certain number of hours I. the mobile devices. I mean, if its free on the computer then why do you have to pay for it here?? so I guess its back to iheartradio for me"
"May 6, 2013","I love this its better then youtube and music on your apple devices but comercials seriously on a music app that's stupid but that's all I have to complain about. all u have 2 do is stop with the commercials we see enough of those on Tv........ :)"
"May 24, 2014","I just kick back and listen to my favorite tunes. I'm 63 years old still working and when I come home from work, I pick up my tablet and go to Pandora, start it up, start listening. I like 60's 70's and 80's. I then go to my favorite media outlets (you know what they are), read through those while listening. I haven't heard a bad song yet."
"February 5, 2013","Pandora lets you listen to music ANY type you want. You create your own station of music any genre, type, artist, song, or anything!!!!! All it requires is Internet access!!! Well if you haven't already got this app from reading the first sentence get it!!!"
"April 29, 2013","I like this app and the music you can listen too. Once you've chosen your genre, it will keep suggestions and songs coming. I do wish Kindle had a better speaker but the sound is not bad and you can listen to your songs without disturbing others."
"December 3, 2013","I have been a member of Pandora as long as they have been available. If you want a music station with no useless information or interruptions"
"December 29, 2011","This app is the best for music. The options on the type of stations you want to listen to and mix them is great. Ideal for a person who likes a variety of music. Only 2 downsides is that you will be listening all day while you are supposed to be doing something else and the commercials, but it's overall fantastic."
"December 4, 2013","I think this is the best way to listen to music. You could have all the songs you want but on phones people by there favorite music when you can get it free right on Pandora. In my opinion I think it's amazing!"
"January 17, 2016","Does not play at all on kindle 10 fire do not waste time"
"December 7, 2012","This app is an amazing app! I love! When I do my homework this is an awesome app because I cant live without music. When music is on, while I'm doing my homework it takes a half hour. And without music it takes me an hour. But I love to dance to it to. I LOVE MUSIC! :)"
"July 24, 2017","Try it out its with it"
"March 5, 2016","At this point, it might as well be a classic."
"September 9, 2012","well I'm a huge owl city fan and Taylor swift but when I got those Radios it would be songs like spongebob(I'm not lying )and stuff.I mean spongebob rocks but has nothing to do with Taylor Swift or Owl City.But other then not putting the right songs on the stations it was a ok app."
"July 21, 2015","I like it because I can chose what music I want to hear. They seem to have all kinds of music."
"June 30, 2017","I love Pandora and its music choices"
"December 9, 2013","I live in Italy and when I first opened this app I was really exited. Then it said ""Pandora is not available in this country"" I am very dissapointed. For those with my problem I suggest iheartradio."
"December 1, 2012","Frustrated that it only screws up on my kindle fire. Pc works fine. I love listening to music almost 24/7 but its annoying when you have to stop whatever you are doing and go close and reopen the app every few seconds. Hopefully I.T. is already working on the solution."
"May 16, 2015","I loved it because when netflix is not working I just put this on and play games then my games stop working."
"July 25, 2014","this is a great app but there are to many breaks from the muisc and I think we should be albe. to skip as much song as we want but other then that it is a great app."
"September 26, 2017","Good music. Many ads."
"November 17, 2013","I like it a lot but I don't like how you can only skip a couple. songs at a time but besides that I love it oh and one more thing I don't like how you have you but your both date some kids under 13 want Pandora."
"December 19, 2013","Non-stop, no interruptions and great for me since I'm spoiled and have Sirius XM in my car so naturally I would want the same when I'm home> And I can even enjoy my favorite genre of music..fantastic!"
"February 1, 2014","this app is a must have for all music lovers! it lets you create personalized stations and doubles as a social media type thing so you can listen to music and talk to friends that also use Pandora."
"January 8, 2014","I like background music and can't stand ads. By using this app I can select the kind of music I like or in the mood for and turn it up. The adds on the free app are short and don't come on very often."
"July 31, 2015","pandora is a great app for people who like music. i personally loved it so so so so so much"
"June 24, 2013","I love this app. I can hear all the music I want all the time. I put in an artist and there is the music. I am in love with this app. Being as it's free, you have a lot of ads, but that's ok with me, because it doesn't stop the music."
"March 18, 2014","Absolutely the best if you want to hear your favorite music and definitley worth upgrading to listen commerical free! Lets you listen to so many different genres of music."
"March 10, 2014","the music is fine , but keep getting pop up adds for every entry I make. I think I will try other sights for tunes."
"December 5, 2012","I was listening to a station while doing my homework and skipped a song and the previous song wad still playing. so know I was stuck listening to a song that I don't want. and also every time I skip a song, the same spainish ad came on..ready to delete next screw up"
"September 8, 2017","I use this app daily!"
"January 20, 2014","it worked great for 2 days and then it stoped working!!! and even in between songes it would shut down and wouldnt let me in the app!!! it would even turn my screen blake a freeze!!!!DONT GET IT!!!!"
"September 14, 2017","Excellent"
"April 4, 2015","this app has all the songs I love for example; lord!!!!!:)  I love all of these songs like lords!!!!! :)"
"June 23, 2015","best thing I have ever seen. I love it my brothers love it. I always sing the songs that are on.@"
"February 11, 2015","I always come back to Pandora for my music this is a very faithful app never lets me down 😁😀😁:-) ;-) :-) :-)"
"February 14, 2015","it is awesome for when I have to clean my room. I just turn on my kindle and poof. music. it help me clean spittle faster"
"May 26, 2013","This is a good app but the app wont get you to your exact song. This app is not that organized but plays reallly good songs. This app allows you to skip up to 6 songs each station your on. This is a great music app I highly reccomend it."
"August 13, 2017","Pandora is DA BOMB!"
"August 6, 2017","Did use this so cannot review."
"April 6, 2015","If you love music you should get Pandora. I love Pandora you should get it. You will love it. BEST THING EVER!!!"
"October 30, 2011","I am a special needs school bus driver and my run is about 180 miles a day. I turn it on in the morning and listen to it literally all day long I have 25+ ""stations"". I have used a lot of different radio apps and I have paid for a few including slacker radio. but this one actually does not drop and buffers nicely."
"December 27, 2012","Love Pandora! I splurged and spend the extra $9.95 to get rid of the commercials and it was a very satisfying move! Love having the extra music to play. I have a large music library but I am always finding new artists on Pandora that I would never have heard."
"August 7, 2015","Pandora was awesome on my Kindle Fire...until yesterday. Still plays great on my iPhone but sucks on Kindle!! Please fix, I beg you."
"October 12, 2016","It's Pandora's music app for Amazon OS. If you like using Pandora then its awesome, if you hate Pandora then you'll hate it."
"November 9, 2017","Love this app"
"March 23, 2014","Ever since I subscribed to get rid of those annoying ads, I've rarely been able to use my Pandora on my Kindle because it's always experiences ""technical difficulties""! Ugh!"
"April 8, 2015","Absolutely great. I love music. hate ads. and hate when it times out but otherwise it is awesome. very good."
"December 5, 2014","The only thing I don't like about Pandora is, you have only five skips. And after that you have to listen to the rest of the songs."
"August 15, 2017","I can't get into it."
"July 10, 2016","Awesome!"
"October 24, 2011","i have love pandora ever since the first time i have heard of the service. it is not for everyone i admit because not everyone is interested in find new artists that are almost identical to the songs/artists they love. but if you want to expand your harizons of artists and genres this is the perfect app for you."
"March 31, 2015","Does what I want it to do and more. I have had no problems with it so far and look forward to using it often."
"July 27, 2013","you'll love it. the only let down is that you need wifi for it to work. I use it a lot so its nice that they made it portable . I feel that if they tried a little harder, they could make so that you wouldn't need internet."
"July 3, 2012","this app is great. I love it! You just put your favorite songs and then it plays songs that are like it! you can also like songs to play them again later or you can do thumbs down so it will skip the song you don't like and it will never play it again. Hope you like this app I loved it."
"March 28, 2016","I must have music as much as I need to breathe. At home, at work, in the car, while I do chores inside/outside, read a book, shower, go to sleep. No time for collecting a library, Pandora can do it for me and let me modify to near perfection."
"December 9, 2012","I AM FAIRLY NEW TO PANDORA, SO I WANT TO BE FAIR IN MY REVIEW, BUT I PARTICULARLY DIDN'T FIND IT USEFUL. A LOT OF COMMERCIALS, MUSIC THAT I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO HEAR. PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SET IT UP CORRECTLY, BUT I AM SURE IT WORKS FOR SOME PEOPLE ;)"
"December 19, 2012","how do i specify my 4 digit date of birth i mean im using a kindle fire how specific can it get? it only lets me enter my date of birth in #'s no spaces,forward slashes and no periods so to register how do i do that anyone with a kindle fire know how to?"
"April 5, 2013","Pandora is a wonderful way to have music where ever you are, well, as long as you have an internet connection that is."
"March 15, 2015","Weres the update on my phone it updated why didn't it on kindle other wise great ill give 5 stars when updates"
"April 3, 2015","My mom put her information in and it would not let her put in her birth date!!! Everything else is GREAT!!!"
"January 2, 2012","This has recently happened; I listen to Pandora constantly, it's really great and has introduced me to a lot of new songs and artist, but now, everytime I listen to a particular station, it says no more songs can be played/found. I haven't had this issue before. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?"
"February 20, 2012","Even the free version is great. You barely notice the ads, and the commercials are few and far between and short. Just give it an idea of what you like (thumbs up) and it takes it. If you don't like a song, thumbs down, and it goes away. I actually turned off the Tv and started listening instead."
"October 15, 2017","Love it!!!"
"September 7, 2017","It is awesome!"
"February 26, 2014","This is an great music app to get.I can listen to my favorite artist anywhere I go.Get this app!!! It is awesome app.Please get Pandora its FREE yah I said it.FREEE FREEE FREE!!!!!!!!"
"December 25, 2012","its so nice to play this and not worry about downloading songs or use a radio with commercials I always play this in the afternoon or morning I even played Christmas songs at the Christmas party if u don't have this get it if its free or not its worth it"
"January 13, 2013","this app is awe it shows your cool little music stations. updates will come and go new stuff will happen like youtube. the only thing that I don't like is the pop ups. because a ad for a blow up doll came on the screen for my mom O.o serioulsy pandora"
"October 9, 2013","I would give pandora 5 stars, it's an awesome way to listen to music, if it was working without me having to shut down my kindle every time I wanted to use it. I can literally turn it on, listen to one song, turn it off, and try again and it won't work. It just shows the blue loading screen. Every single time. I want to use it, but I've used already this time? Shut down my kindle, and hope it works."
"September 7, 2013","The only thing I do not like is the ability to pick a song when your on your station . At least I have a hard time ,"
"May 19, 2013","This app is so awesome. you get to listen to music anytime you want to. you can also create new radio stations.there is one thing I don't like about this app u have to use Internet connection. I think everyone would enjoybthis app."
"September 30, 2012","whenever you make a radio station it play barely anything u want and plays mostly random music. example: my Hollywood undead radio is playing tech n9ne Stevie stone and worst of all Toby Keith country music on a rock station W...T...F! DO NOT GET THIS APP IT IS CRAP"
"October 1, 2015","Delivers as advertised. Use it often. Wonderful free music delivery."
"August 2, 2017","Don't like"
"August 23, 2017","Great App"
"July 3, 2016","Love it"
"October 16, 2014","Yes, it worked well for a month. Now, it crashes everytime I use it! Also, the song selections at times, leave a little to be desired."
"October 11, 2012","Pandora introduces me to artists that are new to me and plays artists that I dearly love. Having my ""own channels"" is just the best. I use Pandora all the time - on my computer at home and at work, on my kindle, my phone, ipod - It is by far my favorite app."
"December 11, 2012","Why is every one complaining about the commercials? Do you guys realize that Pandora makes virtually no reasonable profit from providing this FREE service? Where else can you listen to the music of your choice for free? The radio? Come on people cut these guys some slack."
"February 28, 2016","All my favorite music. I like it."
"June 7, 2016","superb music"
"April 10, 2015","Pandora is fabulous. You can put in any artist or song and it will play that genre of music. It can take a twist and go more country or rock so you have to click thumbs up or down to keep it on track but over all you can enjoy good music for a long time."
"January 11, 2014","I truly like pandora i like that it plays different people close to the singer so i can learn new artist sometimes they put a little bit to much adds but rather than that i think its great!"
"June 14, 2016","It's great"
"November 12, 2015","great"
"January 11, 2016","No seriously better than SPOTIFY &_&"
"October 5, 2013","Pandora is in this country, it was working an hour ago in Kyrgyzstan. Then I tried adding a playlist and it stopped working. So my problem is why don't you want it to work over seas you greedy pieces feces"
"August 18, 2013","Had to refresh after every song. Very frustrating! Don't think it was my fault either, if it was my Droid, shame on Pandora for having such a bad app."
"August 19, 2017","like it"
"April 18, 2015","if I get to get Pandora I will get all kinds of my favorite songs and I will always listen to pandora"
"November 7, 2011","Does a good job of playing customized radio stations on my phone. It has a great balance of playing the general type of music that I want to hear while still giving plenty of variety so the music stays fresh.  The app used to crash on occasion, but the current version appears to have fixed that problem."
"April 5, 2013","I love Pandora so much. I love being able to listen to what I want to and skip the songs I don't like! I also like putting my opinion out there by leaving a comment like "" I love this song so much"" so I hope that those of you reading this will be inspired to get the app and ENJOY=)"
"December 11, 2014","The only complaint is customer sreviews is not so good. It is very hard to get a live person right away when needed."
"March 20, 2012","Good app to help you find artists and songs that are similar to ones that you already know and like. Type in an artist and Pandora will play songs from them and others in the same gendre. The only complaint is the ads, and not being able to skip songs as much as I would like to sometimes."
"March 28, 2012","Wonderful concept. A must have for music lovers. Determines what kind of new music you might like based on your preferred artist. Plays a mixture of both your preferred artist and other artists similar to your preferred artist. Available membership with paid ad free or free with ads."
"June 16, 2015","You tell it what you want to hear, you hear it, just an easy way to listen to your music"
"September 21, 2017","Love this app."
"January 11, 2014","I like 90-95% of the music I hear, I think it's great, keep playing the good stuff. I really don't mind the commercials because they allow you to get up and get a drink or something."
"August 28, 2017","Knows a lot of tunes"
"December 13, 2014","Way too many ad's and didn't have some stations I was looking for. Spotify is way better they have less ad's and more music"
"August 21, 2013","This app is great I used to use it every night but in the morning it take w or e minutes to shut it off. first you have to push the still listening then when the music starts AGAIN you have to shut off the add then you have to go to your channel. list and click the button to open the menu to shut it off. and its all deliberate so you will buy the pay service. No thanks I'll. just use something else."
"December 23, 2014","love this app, love the different stations and the alarm clock. There is so many songs and its amazing . olive this app."
"October 9, 2017","Can't get good songs"
"November 15, 2011","I have the paid version. the free version became pointless because of the commercials, just like spotify and terrestrial radio. the biggest flaw of pandora in the android/fire version is the lack of a way to filter out bands that you don't like...unless it's right in front of me and I didn't see it."
"July 15, 2015","This app gives you the opportunity to listen to free music. Plus you can listen to any artist. YOU SHOULD TOTALLY GET THE BEST APP EVER PANDORA! And you can play minecraft with pandora. LoL I'm even listening to pandora as I write this."
"September 22, 2017","I give more than five stars because I love this pandora music"
"December 23, 2014","Too many commercials breaking up the flow of the music, and the ads to upgrade to paid service, when it was always free"
"January 11, 2015","Great app. I always have trouble finding a perfect app for my music. But I found it!! It's so helpful. I love it :P"
"September 13, 2015","I get to hear the music I want to hear with no commercials. Kelly"
"August 1, 2013","I had the app before and stopped using it. Just got back on and it's better but the purpose of creating a certain artist station is to only listen to that artist. I hear music completely different from the artist"
"December 20, 2014","You can type any song Holiday and even artist it's completely amazing!!! I do not know if you can make your own tho:)"
"August 4, 2017","PANDORA is AWESOME"
"May 9, 2016","Pandora music"
"February 13, 2014","it's ok so far. not sure if Silk is the issue but while listinening in the background and browsing other sites Pandora has quit playing. that is annoying and shouldn't happen."
"December 9, 2012","no longer do I wish to waste my time with this ixmpecible app. as a music app critic, I have heard and used every app for music known. in all of my career this has been one of the most repolsive. no sound ever çame even with the volume on Max. I was declined of severally stations and the same song plays every ten minutes. if u r looking for an app worth the time, continue ur search by pressing back and scrolling to other options"
"December 5, 2011","Why does this application need access to permissions such as my contact list in order to play music?  It is a known issue on the iOS version of the application- tracking personally identifiable information such as GPS coordinates. I find it astonishing that the company has made no comment to the tech news press about why they need such information, or why it has to be pinged so frequently. I understand that they need general location data for advertisements, but ""up to the minute"" is completely unnecessary. What is this company up to?"
"December 23, 2014","I tried typing inky password but it said no I hav has thia beforw now I wont let mw use it!!!!!!!!!like;sereiosly!!!!"
"September 24, 2012","I love this app. I must say that I was shocked at the one star reviews but then I noticed they complained about ads. I don't have those problems because of Pandora one. I have not experienced it cutting off songs either. perhaps they have fixed those errors."
"August 24, 2017","Sucked because it wasnt worth hearing on my Fire, not loud enough for one and"
"October 8, 2012","well first to u guys that have problems finishing songs that is cuz u have Bad wifi. but over all yjid app is my life. I listen to it every day. but the only suckish part bout it is that u need wifi.... otherwise its absolutely great! get this now!!!!!!!!"
"November 30, 2012","Ok I love this app sure it stops ""SOMETIMES"" and that's only if you have put your electronic to sleep for a while so it thinks you fell asleep so it closes down and it got update not to long ago so try it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!please!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"December 13, 2012","Like the stars say it's okay but it really makes me mad when in the middle of a REALLY good song and it crashes. Now I used too use Pandora EVERYDAY but now it gets on my nerves... I'm think about a different music app... It TRUELY is a shame..."
"March 30, 2016","I often have to hard-exit whenever I loose cell data connection... Connection comes back but Pandora won't play....  The last update broke Pandora... I had to uninstall and reinstall for it to work again.  Pandora, please slow down, get it right and then ship it out... Also, less features and permissions are desired..."
"February 24, 2014","I pay for Pandora One and I love it except that lately there has been an ad for using Pandora as an alarm. Please remove the ad. I pay for Pandora because I do not want ads."
"August 23, 2017","I love being in charge of my music choices. I get to hear all sorts of new stuff too."
"January 19, 2016","Great way to listen to free music."
"March 26, 2012","the app has good songs but has to many adds take away the adds 5 stars why do I care about adds I just want to hear my music another thing I love Katy Perry songs and 1 came on I tried to press like I messed up and hit dislike the song changed right away so now wont hear it again"
"May 25, 2016","5 star"
"March 30, 2017","It's best to upgrade to commercial free if you are an every day listener!"
"December 27, 2011","this app has worked perfectly, never skipping, stalling, or repeated ads. I would recomend it for everyone  I haven't had trouble with it once but of you do i would.uninstall and reinstall"
"March 11, 2012","this app is super great on kindle fire and is nice and clear. it allows you to put in a song title or artist and creates your very own station. I am listing to it right now. you can listen to any kind of music you want to hear. Classical, Rock, Pop, Or Country. I LOVE IT! !!!!!!!"
"September 17, 2014","I used to be really picky with my music Pandora finds new songs I like and then I make stations for them and it's an endless loop of new songs!!!!"
"June 23, 2012","this app was great! im listening to it right now. i dont know how to get music from itunes on my kindle fire so this app was amazing! i love taylor swift so ijust typed in her name and it brought me to lots of other songs that i am now in love with! thankyou pandora!"
"July 2, 2017","ok"
"December 23, 2014","gfgh gut gsrfig Geri ts fhj vscjvut gdyfu great app :) fgj ghvhc fugitive jgj. wonderful app :)! offhand hgg Hrh."
"January 22, 2014","Loads without any problems. Easy to set up. Great music selection. Can chose a song, a singer, or a genre, and create a customized station.recommend."
"February 3, 2014","I think that Pandora is a great app and would recommend it to anybody but the one thing that pisses me off is how after you skip a couple songs they wont let you skip anymore"
"March 25, 2015","I love Pandora! it has great music and it cost no money. I think Pandora is great for my kindle."
"July 3, 2012","because when ever I am lissening to more than 5 songs it tells me "" this station is no longer able to fetch songs"" then I try and create a new station and it doesn't let me! !!!!!! I lov lissening to the radio but this station stinks! :( please help me!!!"
"July 29, 2017","Love it, the sound is fantastic. I never thought I would ever have it on my Fire."
"April 20, 2016","Great music."
"June 3, 2013","I used to LOVE Pandora! Friendly interface, great intuition to what music to play, etc... until NOW. For free radio, the cap is now 40 hours per month. Are you for real?? With all of the ads floating on this thing, suddenly, you want US to pay YOU $3.99??? Take a powder, Pandora!  I started using RADITAZ, people!!! Free radio, no ads, no limits, except on how many songs you can skip in one hour. Even has a carosel for songs. So, for now, my radio needs are taken care of via Raditaz or TuneIn Radio (free version). Pandora must be INSANE!!"
"May 12, 2016","Awesome"
"December 30, 2014","I think Pandora is great it has all types of music and is enjoyable and its endless you can use it all the time"
"September 24, 2017","Great music app"
"April 16, 2015","I can dance to the music all day long so much cool music.I can take it anywhere. I love it."
"July 23, 2017","I always use Pandora for Music streaming works well wit the Amazon Echo and on my S7 phone p"
"November 22, 2013","it has really gross adds and it wont let me listen to the songs that I want to. SPOTIFY IS BETTER!!! It lets you get your favorite songs when you want it and its free, and it has cleaner adds than Pandora. GET SPOTIFY!!!"
"November 1, 2016","Great"
"March 26, 2014","Easy to use. My favorite music follows me everywhere. I'd highly recommend Pandora for anyone who love music and wants to be able to access it anytime, anywhere."
"November 13, 2012","I really like Pandora. But for some reason, and only recently, I can't exit the app on my Kindle Fire. The button for the option to quit will not respond. I thought it was my Kindle but the button works fine on my phone and other devices. I have to shut down to close it. I may be crazy and it's only me with this issue but is there anyone else having this problem?"
"December 9, 2013","Keeps crashing and wont reboot after forceclose love to have this fixed in the next update or atleast a message on help ive deleted and redoulwnloaded it 3 times already .kindle fire"
"January 25, 2016","I love the Pandora music app!"
"March 25, 2015","so much music I love how you get the music just for you on the other hand it has a skip limit."
"December 22, 2014","absolutely love it! i play it all the time and when im not its all because of the internet. highly recommended!"
"December 30, 2012","I have been using Pandora since I downloaded on my kindle fire & it does have good quality of music when it wants to play. It seems it recently has been fixed. hopefully no interruptions will occur again. I hate it when it forcloses."
"February 24, 2015","This is so AWESOME. I sleep at night with this app going"
"April 21, 2014","pandora is great but it has problems just like every other game. it it hard to get back into once you uninstall it from where ever. GET IT PEOPLE GET IT!!!!!"
"May 1, 2016","not bad"
"February 7, 2017","Great tunes"
"June 21, 2012","well you see Pandora is a great radio its just that there is commercials which I don't want to listen to and when you try tonpick the songs some thing else comes up another song that u didn't want!! but other wise I really like it so I'm gonna give it three stars"
"September 3, 2013","Worked great on my Fire. On HD, it freezes at the splash screen. Just want it to work like it did on my old Fire guys. Left it installed, hoping for an update.  Thanks  Aprilmp5"
"March 29, 2016","Love Pandora!"
"May 13, 2014","I <33 this app for itsmm music. only complaint is u cant pick the very song u want to put on but I still think it should be given 5 stars. buy now!!!"
"July 16, 2012","I luv pandora! it used 2 work great on my kindle fire. but lately while music is playing its kinda staticy at some times and a few times completely skipped over a song. i dont know if theres a problem with my kindle or the app. besides that, its a great app!!"
"July 5, 2014","love this app. its like a radio station on your kindle.there's so many songs.you can follow and talk to people. highly recommend it.MUST GET!!"
"November 15, 2013","Just got the newest update. Did it take off the sleep timer? If not, how can I set it now?"
"December 30, 2013","I would like more choice for artist not just their popular songs, album list. After listening you begin to hear the same songs over and over again almost like commercial radio."
"February 3, 2016","Pandora is an amazing app"
"June 23, 2014","It just keeps getting better. Constantly making improvements. Pandora exceeds all expectations for quality and ease of use. Two words: awe some!"
"January 25, 2013","I love the different venues of music to choose from..and I am in the middle of changing providers as the old one has no space left on satelite..so my computer is really slow..I can't wait to share this site with friends and family!"
"February 10, 2014","ilove it it has great songs and you can look up what ever station you want and you can skip songs it is basically like your ipod but you don't have to pay for the songs"
"November 5, 2013","I like the app. just after the last update I got it wont let me sign back. it just says it is having technical issues. to get on I have to uninstall the app and redownload it everytime."
"February 11, 2012","There is a free Pandora and there is a pay version. This app allows for both but if you don't have a subscription then expect commercials and popups. The yearly fee is worth the price; no apps, no ads and higher bitrate streaming.  I love Pandora and this app does it justice."
"November 7, 2012","I think this app is amazing you can listen to your songs favorite songs withough having to buy them but you cant go back a song or resins to a part you miss and you have to hope you get a song you like that's really the only down sides though"
"February 22, 2016","Too many ads though."
"March 30, 2014","I love music, so I decided to download this app. Not only has it allowed me to find different artists, but form a radio around them that I enjoy. The ads may be annoying, but you can update to premium, or just deal with the ads. Either way, it's still one of the best apps ever. Definitely recommend you getting this. Why not? It's free!"
"June 24, 2017","love it"
"May 5, 2013","My friend downloaded Pandora and she loves it. Whenever I come over to her house we always listen to it. There are so many stations and songs to pick from. Definatly buy this app. Totally worth it. I reccomend this."
"December 20, 2013","don't waste your money on some other music app its no mathch for this app. its free also instead of paying"
"September 8, 2014","I found it hard to navigate and find a particular song. Also, I didn't expect it to use data charges when I play it through the app on my car."
"October 22, 2012","this is a app I use everyday when I work out or just wanna listen to some good music. I like how you can listen to millions of songs without even touching your tablet it will find songs for you! its a great and handy app I highly recommend it."
"December 2, 2012","Pandora is the best music radio. you can listen to music whenever and whatever music you want to listen to. make up your own radio station and its awesome listen to all your favorite music. for those of you who love music get Pandora!!!!"
"November 22, 2011","Where should I start. 1. The app only works 45%ofthe time - it force closes or drops a song. 2. They put banners over all the buttons so you cant like skip pause etc. Oh and get this; the close button on the ad doesn't work just sends you right to the advertiser's site. Bravo, Pandora."
"May 22, 2013","u can make ur own stations (i mean like type like an artist and u get a station about them) u can like songs plus u can skip a song u dont want to here. i love it i already have 84 stations its pretty cool"
"December 28, 2012","Pick a fav artist or song and build your stations. Very few commercials on free version. Been using for years...no complaints. Almost as good as XM . Add some adult talk stations, like Opie & Anthony. Then 4 stars gets 5 stars."
"August 19, 2013","This thing isn't letting me listen to music !! I haven't been able to for like 2 weeks !! I'm done, I'm going to another music app !!"
"May 20, 2014","My Wife and I have so enjoyed using Pandora over many years and I can say not once has it not been there for us.  Thank you  Ric"
"June 11, 2013","I have this app on my kindle fire, Ipod touch, & android phone! great music for different occasions. I love it! Works great on all of them! I suggest you get it & enjoy it :) free music for everyone!"
"October 26, 2014","You can pick any station. If you're bored you can chose any tile of music you like. When it's Sunday I turn on hymns."
"October 24, 2011","I dont mind the station having ads but playing over the top of the songs is very annoying. The old method of playing the ad in between the songs made much more sense. Maybe it is a glitch but I dont really understand what the ad is saying with the song still playing in the background."
"October 9, 2014","I LOVE THE PANDORA MUSIC THATS WHY I USE THIS APP THE END what no DON'T GO RIGHT NOW OKAY NOW YOU CAN GO THE END FINNALY"
"March 29, 2016","Love it!!"
"January 4, 2013","I entered that I wanted to hear Lady Gaga. I heard one Lady Gaga song and the rest were songs from all the pop princesses like Brittney Spears, Katy Perry, etc. Then I entered I wanted to hear Little Big Town. Once again, I heard two Little Big Town songs, and rest of the songs were just numerous other country singers, that I don't really care to hear. I am a little disappointed. I guess I was expecting to hear only the singers I requested."
"October 23, 2011","i love this app because not only doe it learn what i like, but it also won't play that anoying song(s) i don't like. great to make a catagory for exercising, relaxing or driving in the car. i plug my phone into car and it rocks! (mitsubishi lancer has plug to adapt phones to speakers)"
"December 12, 2012","I think Pandora has a better music quality than iheart radio but I have problems switching stations. I often have more then one song playing at one time so I have to uninstall the app to get it to stop playing which is really annoying during school."
"December 17, 2012","Sure its a free app, and I expect ads, but they are way too intrusive.  And only having a limited number of song skips each hour is silly! Why should I have to listen to songs I don't like? Why do they even have that rule?"
"June 13, 2012","Love the radio.Don't ever belive the 1or 2 star reviews cuz they are NOT true.All I know is that the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I want clean music but I got dirty music.But don't take my word for it.Lets just say its 100% free and a great radio."
"October 24, 2017","Too many commercials!"
"December 25, 2011","Pandora has been a companion for over nine months now, and I love it! It gives variety, and spice to life, from something to listen to while getting ready for work in the morning or working out in the gym. The latest to oldest music you can get your hands on. Thank you Pandora."
"November 25, 2012","I love the app, and when the kindle is plugged into the charger battery life isn't the problem. But after every two songs it plays the same annoying advertisement, I know that's how Pandora makes money. But come on, every two songs???"
"December 23, 2011","I have been a Pandora fan for a long time. This product enables you to put in the name of a person or group and then listen to their music as well as music in the same genre. You are then able to ""like"" or ""dislike"" each song, helping Pandora create a great experience for you."
"February 12, 2013","This version of Pandora is really different. The music stops playing after two songs because it wants to see if I'm still listening; and my favorite stations are hard to get to now. They should have left it the way it was."
"October 21, 2015","This app is as huge help when I'm cleaning"
"August 13, 2013","Beware of using Pandora with a SmartTV, particularly if it's a Samsung. There's a known bug that forces you to unplug your television in order to exit the App. You should also know ahead of time that there's no telephone for Customer Service and that Customer Service available by E-Mail is neither expedient nor helpful.  There are better music subscription choices."
"October 22, 2012","I really love this app. Its free entrrtainment. I can listen to it at my house whenever I want to. I only with they'd let you skip as many times as you want, but that's to be expected. I also wish you could take it where there is no wifi."
"September 11, 2017","Great product listen daily."
"August 21, 2013","Pandora was ok when u were able 2 skip 6 times every hour but now they skimp u on skips and the lame comercials every othe song. I jst download my own music and not have 2 worry bout using it"
"March 14, 2016","Love it!!"
"December 13, 2014","Love it!! I can listen all day to a mixture of Christmas carols. I will continue to listen to music at work."
"December 27, 2013","Love this free music provider. I can play albums, or single selections. I have my music library set up which I can add to at any time. I enjoy the app on my Kindle Fire."
"July 18, 2017","Always has a very easy system for finding what you are looking for.... Mark D Mitchell"
"June 24, 2013","I throughly enjoy being able to listen to the different genre of music, my favorite genre is Gospel, I can listen to the old music as well as the new music by various artists. Pandora, Gotta have it!"
"June 29, 2014","Unlimited amount of music and all in categories. Exceptional playing time. Would recommend this for anyone that wants to enjoy music."
"May 26, 2013","Now that you only have a forty hour time limit is aggravating. If you want to listen to more you have to pay. This used to be all free unless you wanted to remove apps. Not happy Pandora not happy at all."
"October 9, 2012","OMG this is an awesome app u can listen to music while draw or play another game in your...whatever u got but u have to pay attenton to it sometimes it will play excplicet stuff but it will warn u so pay attention to the music people!!!!!"
"April 8, 2013","Pandora is awesome I love it I think every body should have Pandora. it is great this app gives you free songs you don't need to pay for anything and you can listen to whatever kind of music you like tots adore!"
"July 23, 2013","No commercials just music tailored to your own tastes. It also provides tracks that are similar to your own favorites. The yearly license is worth the small investment. XM radio and Sirius cannot compete with this. The only drawback if there is one is that they have a time limit where if you don't rate/skip a track or whatever it will go into a play pause mode until you tell them you are still listening. A small price to pay."
"August 12, 2017","The best"
"January 8, 2016","love it better than XM"
"July 9, 2013","I had Pandora for a while and I love it.But sometimes it will say unable to fetech anymore songs.When that gets fixed there will be 5 stars.Other than that I think u should get this asap.I love it"
"March 19, 2016","Niceee"
"May 18, 2013","No.matter what your mood, choose a station and transcend your every day concerns and pressures. Purchase the Pandora One option. It is WELL worth it. No, I DON'T have any affiliation or connection with Pandora!"
"June 12, 2013","you must get this app if you love music!!!!!! its awesome. I enjoy it tons. and you would enjoy it to. give it a try. if you don't like (which will be very unlikely) you could just un install the app."
"December 21, 2012","Pretty good app, works well on my device. I took one point off because it tends to play the same artist too often even when I add plenty of other artists to a station (with the artist in question being excluded from the list)."
"November 21, 2015","LOVE IT. My favorite GO TO!!!!!"
"June 30, 2014","works the same as on your phone. like having it on here while I'm browsing.I recommend it.I love listening to music so this is great."
"February 6, 2016","It is so cool"
"December 4, 2012","I loaded my 6 year old daughter's account with kid-friendly stations like Kids Bop and her favorite Disney-backed young singers! I am disappointed that I couldn't download Willow Smith's Whip My Hair without a complete station that included adult artists whose music isn't kid-friendly."
"June 23, 2014","I LIKE LISTENING TO DIFFERENT GENRES. PANDORA GIVES ME LOTS OF OPTIONS. I CAN LISTEN TO MY PREFERRED MUSIC WHENEVER I WANT."
"June 1, 2014","It plays awesome songs, and I don't even need to go back to the app after every song and search up a new one, it just plays songs for me."
"November 18, 2015","Pandora not working fire 7 2015"
"March 21, 2014","I love the Showtunes Radio! I hear a mix of songs from Broadway, movies, and Disney movies!! I also love seeing lyrics and info on the music plying."
"June 30, 2017","Just GREAT."
"October 22, 2013","I love Pandora because its free music and you can listen to all the songs you love instead of having to waste money so I was so glad when I heard Pandora was out I love pandora"
"June 24, 2014","Pandora is a really cool music player. I like having both Slacker and Pandora but if Pandora was my only one I could deal with that."
"March 3, 2016","awesome"
"April 19, 2014","I love being able to listen any genre of music that I choose. Music is a big part of my life and Pandora fits right in with my music lifestyle."
"January 27, 2017","Cool but it want let me play the hit's that like over or again and that's messed up cause bad and boujee is a repeater to be honest"
"June 30, 2017","I luv pandora so much!!!! Thumbs up and thumbs down r cool. And being able to skip songs u dont like is great. Pandora Premium is totally awesome with full albums of music and playlists. Five stars"
"March 11, 2016","wen I got the app I loved it.I was like oh my gosh it has all my favrit songs on it and thare free!thrust me you will love it so much you wont delete it ever.it has all of my favrit songs on it.it will have your favrit songs on it to!"
"November 10, 2011","I had to go back to an old version to just get it to work. Still very sketchy using that. Takes a minute to load the first song then twenty seconds to over a minute to play the next song. Do you call that quality? Because I don't. I've had better luck using Slacker. Droid X2"
"March 26, 2015","excellent app!! love it because you can get the tunes you want when you want!!!"
"May 29, 2015","It is free and provides music It's perfect #I'm so cheap"
"April 29, 2013","I love dis app its so cool. If U R reading dis I say get this. Me <3 dis app.  Me <3 Austin Mahone. BYE look up Austin Mahone he is so hot. Its more like Austin Mahotie. LOL!!!!!:{D"
"March 16, 2014","this is a really, really good app! love it! I highly recommend this for anyone who loves music like I do! it works really well on my kindle fire too."
"February 19, 2014","Great concept, well thought out. Love being able to have control of different artitst and their genres of music. Love that you can mix things up. Kudos!"
"January 23, 2016","Best music app"
"September 12, 2014","even with the ad supported free version, the interruptions are not too bad. Good music and good ""channels"""
"May 19, 2012","I love Pandora becouse when I don't want. to listern yo people and I'm at home I put one earphones and I forget I be In a house I be singing as loud as possible get this app it rock awesomeness is not even close to it there is really not a word for it"
"February 13, 2016","great app"
"February 11, 2015","I like that you can listen to your type of music while reading an e-book, email, Facebook, etc."
"March 4, 2014","Taps right into your Pandora account. Works great. The only thing is if your Fire times out, there's a several step process to get Pandora turned OFF."
"November 27, 2016","I HIT DORA WITH A PAN CALLED IT PANDORA"
"February 2, 2016","great music"
"March 25, 2015","I can create my own selections (old or new) or I can just select what I like from their selections."
"July 26, 2012","Not sure which update screwed this up but nothing plays when i use the app. A few seconds of buffering and it moves on to the next song, buffers then next song. Ads take up at least 50% of my nexus s 4g screen."
"September 28, 2016","Blackberry 10 OS #1."
"December 28, 2011","I love the Pandora app on my Kindle Fire. I have it on my Android phone and when I first searched for it on the Fire, I couldn't find it. I was VERY HAPPY to see the icon the other day. Sound quality is great and I haven't had any issues with freezing as of yet."
"November 4, 2011","Pandora radio is great. It really does a decent job of playing songs you like. You can ban songs from your radio station and add songs more to your style.  Jazz, Hiphop, Motown, Mozart, Progressive Trance.... No commercials and more streaming time if you are a plus member."
"April 9, 2013","Love Pandora listen to our all the time with Pandora there's no need for satellite radio limited commercials u get comedy from your favorite artist"
"November 8, 2014","I couldn't find any thing I searched on there. If it found something, it was totally not what I wanting"
"February 27, 2012","I used to enjoy this app because it gave me a variety of music from the designated artist, genre, or composer. Soon, it started playing music that wasn't even related to the station. It is quite disappointing on Pandora's account."
"December 28, 2013","If I choose an artist for the play list, you're lucky if you'll hear that band play at all or maybe one or two times in an hour. Seems to always be the same songs played most times. I guess that's what you get for the free Pandora. Lots of adds and commercials Sometimes it's easier to just put my radio on and switch stations as I go along.  However, paid Pandora might be the alternative in order to see if it is still worth it or not."
"May 29, 2017","Fantastic"
"December 11, 2014","you should download Pandora I love how you can hear music for free if some one does not now about Pandora tell them"
"September 5, 2013","Pandora keeps things simple and straight forward. It provides music to me at the low cost of one commercial every 15 minutes or so. A better deal than regular radio if you ask me."
"November 9, 2017","cant get it to work"
"June 19, 2012","pandora keeps playing music until you pause it or shut the kindle down. perfect for all music needs. because of the feature that makes keep playing you can turn it the screen off to save power. also works while playing games. great application."
"March 29, 2016","It will play music that you probably like. I've had issues with glitching and general misbehavior from the Pandora apps, but right now I think it's in a solid, usable state."
"May 5, 2014","loved it great opputunities for life for you and me and great music I guess.thanks for the oppurtunity google and I want to thank my mom"
"February 15, 2012","When I first got this.app I thought it would be just another immitation of itunes.But when I started using Pandora I said wow this isn't just any other music app this is the universe speaking to us through music. So in conclusion I recomomend this app to all."
"October 27, 2013","I love it but sometimes it doesn't work on my phone it will just have a blue Pandora screen so I have to shut my phone down then turn it back on just to listen to music."
"January 6, 2015","I have ben waging seems like for ever for it to down Lorne it like 2 mints for it to Lorne."

"December 23, 2014","Can't get this app on Samsung 5 Wonder why? Amazon says it isn't supported. ..! ?"
"December 17, 2011","I have this on my Bionic, my Fire, my Xoom and my desktop at work and it works flawlessly. I use it to stream music during my commute too. Much better than commercial radio with all the chatter! I'm also a member, it's well worth the price if you're a music junkie."
"June 16, 2014","I like this app. I usually use it for an alarm and that's pretty much it. Just one problem, what's with the sysrem maintanence?"

"November 12, 2012","I love to listen to music because it motivation and it also make my day flow better. I also like to hear my favorite songs while I'm working out. Sometimes I think when I listen to music it changes my energy in a good way."
"August 9, 2013","Now I can listen to music without interruption and select my own genre of music, artists, etc. It's best than downloading itunes into my iPhone and then having to use up my battery"
"December 29, 2013","I enjoy Pandora because it picks songs from a genre that I choose. I can also rate the song so it will either play it again in the future or not. It's fun!!"
"August 20, 2015","Always a good choice for music streaming. Available on all platforms."
"September 28, 2012","I'll admit up front this app is my intro to ""custom "" radio so unlike other reviewers I cannot compare this to others of its type. I do love the concept and find the newest update makes the app much more user friendly."
"January 1, 2015","I am using it on my Black Berry. The app I had (Apollo) stop working and of course, Black Berry doesn't have another. No surprise, don't ask. This app is a poor substitute at best (for Black Berry's). It is not clear, actually has static over the channel and hard to navigate. I will keep it because I love Pandora but, continue to look for an alternative."
"April 5, 2013","A good app, but advertising keeps it from being a great one. I have a gripe about some of the music on my one station is too old for the genre."
"November 22, 2014","Pandora is a great way to not have to keep having to find a diffrent song when each one is over."
"January 9, 2012","I have not had this app ""force close"" on me ever on my Kindle Fire. It is nicely designed and gives easy access to all the same capabilities as the Pandora web site. If you want another mobile option for access to Pandora, I highly recommend getting this app."

"September 17, 2014","Pandora by far is the best! I have tried other stations that are OK, but Pandora is on a whole other level."

"September 4, 2013","I want to pick the online radio stations I listen to, not the genre. The app that has the valentines day symbol as part of it's name gives me what I want so this app ia gone."
"January 5, 2013","Works great with my kindle. I liked the fact that I can personalize it, no DJs, no commercials. But I want to be able to create a play list. The best part is I can listen to my music while I'm reading my book."
"November 17, 2012","I enjoy listening to new music and Pandora has introduced me to many of my favorite bands. It's definitely worth downloading. Paying for the subscription makes it even better and helps out one of my favorite companies."
"December 11, 2012","this app has almost all the music in the world. and some apps are realy bad and u have to pay for it.on my kindle u get commercials every 7 songs or something like that and they are only 30 seconds most of the time"
"September 26, 2016","I love that it has up to date music, but what i dont like that its plays some many commercials. And have to pay some to for commercial free music ."
"December 27, 2013","Great AP for the music lover. It's customizable to your specific taste in music and gives amazing recommendations! Get it!"
"August 15, 2013","I love Pandora!!! One of the few apps that they have left as originally set up. It does EXACTLY what the description says and works as designed. Love it! Love it! Love it!"
"January 30, 2016","btuh"
"January 25, 2015","I keep getting error code 3002."
"January 21, 2012","Pandora is the best. You can find anything you want to listen too. Loads Quickly and you get to make your own stations, rate songs, jump to next song if you don't like listening to one. It doesn't cut in and out like regular radio. Great for road trips."
"February 4, 2012","The music is good, but when I want a certain artist like Taylor Swift, they play 1 TS song at the beginning and then a bunch of random songs. I just want Taylor Swift!! Also, they only let you skip 6 songs per hour which is crap. Unlimited skips please!!"
"August 13, 2015","Great stations..they just repeat A LOT!!"

"November 20, 2012","Its a radio what more do these people want. Its got a lot more features than the radio in your car. It barely ever plays a commercial. So I don't see why everyone is Downing padora when its a really good app. :)"
"October 4, 2017","I can't do a thing on this app, you need to fix this please:-("
"December 3, 2012","I used to use this app all the time. But lately it will just randomly stop playing - all too often. I can only get it to play one or two songs now before it quits. It's unusable now. I hope it gets fixed soon."
"May 20, 2013","-after having this app for five months its starts telling you ur at your monthly limit of 40 hours. I timed it this month and I listened for 10 hours and now it wont let me listen anymore!"
"April 30, 2016","If it had less ads that would be nice, it feels like every 2-3 songs there is an ad 😐 I would give it 5 stars if it had less ads but I personally think they give us to many. I know it is free but still"
"January 4, 2016","Love it!"
"October 12, 2013","every time i turn on pandora an advertisement pops up and wont close so that i can maintain the music selection. i will uninstall until this is resolved in the ap."
"April 5, 2013","at first, I thought this app was the best thing ever, especially to listen to k-pop, but then I updated it and now I can't listen to it none stop unless I pay or be limited for every month. I wish I didn't update and am warning you not to, too."
"July 13, 2013","free music free music free music its like a radio but its an app its free music and the app is free too get this instead of wasting money to buy a different app or to buy a radio"
"August 19, 2012","this is one of my best and favorite apps ive had so far on my kindle fire; but there's one thing why I didn't rate five stars so many adds after 3 to 5 songs sometimes less just cut out on the adds!!!! but over a good app!!!!"
"February 7, 2012","Pandora is great and I recommend this site to everyone that I know who doesn't already use it! I have never had any problem with Pandora only a great experience. I just wish I could afford to buy the service where I would have un-interupted playback."
"May 26, 2013","I love this app! I will turn it on when ever i want to listen to music!! The only problem is occasionally it will like skip and pause and stuff when my kindle is doing too much at once."
"August 8, 2012","to those complaining about it not playing enough of the artist you make the channel for, the riaa regulates them and only allow them to play a single artist 6 times with in a 3 hour period on a given ""channel""per user"
"March 8, 2014","I can listen to music for free now and the only thing that I don't like which I hope they can get rid of is the commercials but its great"
"September 16, 2013","this app froze and never came back I had to reset my kindle and lost everything that I put on my kindle"
"April 18, 2012","I am frustrated with this android app for Kindle Fire. Why can I not add content to a newly created station? Did Pandora now take features away from the free subscribers? What gives? If so, it's. not the best way to encourage upgrading...."
"June 12, 2012","I really like this app. it knows just what to play. I love listening to the praise and worship station while falling asleep, its very soothing. overall a great app in my opinion, if you dont like it then sorry, download something else"
"September 25, 2012","Very easy to use, love the organization. Very easy and quick app. Its is very easy to transfer all the information from your kinddle to your comp, although the interface is easy to use, i feel the look should be updated."
"November 16, 2015","Great music app."
"May 25, 2013","I think Pandora is a good app and I think everone should get Pandora you will be so happy any proud that you got Pandora at your side and you will be so happy with Pandora get Pandora."

"October 6, 2012","I love this app, its great and since I love pandora this app makes listening to Pandora super easy on mobile devices! nothing wrong with it. I'd love it if I could skip more than like 5 or 6 songs every hour though :P"
"October 10, 2015","http://www.pandora.com/"
"May 20, 2016","Awesome app BUT it's a battery hog! U can literally watch ur batt going"
"April 29, 2015","This is a cool music app you can make your own categories"
"November 17, 2011","For something that touts itself as internet radio, it's customization options are ridiculously limited. One might assume that, since it asks you to enter an artist's name to create your own personalized radio station, that you will be listening to that artist on said station. Not so. You will listen to 1 song by that artist and then a whole bunch by people you've likely never heard of and that have nothing to do with the artist you entered. If it allowed you to enter artists you want to hear songs by and then actually played songs by those artists, and *only* those artists, I would no doubt give it a higher rank. The commercals and skip limits just make it all the worse. In short, if you are picky about your music, look elsewhere. This isn't going to give you many real options for customizing your personal ""station"".  Signed, Pamela T."
"October 6, 2012","We've grown to love Pandora as our background music for gatherings and parties. We access it over Roku and our main TV which is central to our house and our lifestyle. Great service with great music for all tastes."
"March 19, 2012","this app is amazing, if you complain about ads, get over it and pay. they have to make money some way if no one buys it. imagine if you didn't get paid at your job. this app is the best music app out there and either learn to love it or gtfo."
"September 5, 2012","I love Pandora it helps me get me through the day with homework and etc.. It helps me do everything around my house!! You should really get it. you can like and dislike songs on it so you dont have to listen to it again!"
"August 9, 2013","I enjoy Pandora. It lets you listen to a wide range of music and even stand up comedies by different comedians. The only thing I dislike is the ads but there aren't many."
"February 14, 2014","This app is amazing!!! I listen to it all the time! I luv how I can listen to music with out always having to search for a fifteenth song."
"July 18, 2015","Very good app I like the music very much"
"April 27, 2013","Pandora was the best thing until I had to start paying the monthly fee. It used to be that it was free with adds, but now after I updated it I cant listen to music anymore. total rip off"
"March 21, 2012","I was totally surprised at how enjoyable this app is! It works great on my Kindle Fire, with no problems. All my favorite types of music in one place and it is free.  I haven't enjoyed music so much for many years. Many thanks!!"
"June 17, 2012","there's to many commercails! there the same ones too. you cant look up a song because when you do you have to listen to a random playlist. if you look up feel so close by Calvin Harris you get skrillex and all these random song's!"
"December 10, 2012","i usually dont mind ads, but everytime an ad starts to play it freezes and my music stops playing and the only way i know how to fix it is by force stopping my pandora with the system settings. please help!"
"May 21, 2013","this app is amazing you can take it any where there's wifi and you have tons of music at your fingertips you can create stations for artists. and share them and I repeat. its amazing"
"October 12, 2016","Ok"
"May 8, 2013","I really do enjoy listening to Pandora on all my devices. It is so nice that it sync's my choices to all devices too. I love the various radio stations! Thanks for such a great app!"
"April 2, 2015","I love this game it is super duper pooper fun! 💖💜💝😀🐱🐣🗽"
"July 1, 2015","So so so much music! Can't believe it!"
"April 23, 2013","I love this app I listen to it every day and I like how they updated it. this is so cool and there is some songs I haven't heard in a while that I like plus you create your own stations."
"March 25, 2012","This app is a waste of time, it plays music of people, groups I have never heard of and music I would Never listen to. Granted this is a free app but must I be forced to listen to music not chosen by me! Not to mention the never-ending ads!"
"November 7, 2013","this is awesome. it responds to my likes and dislikes. the only thing bad is on taylor swift radio it keeps playing country when all i want is taylor....."
"December 3, 2011","This app works great, but however you should be aware that this app will use a lot of data while playing I use my home wifi, and or find a free wifi spot while I'm out so I don't burn through all my allotted data. I wish the widget was a little better."
"December 22, 2015","Great"
"December 9, 2013","Love being able to listen to the artists I like and not ALL artists. Having the program suggest artists that I might not be familiar with is great."
"February 25, 2012","Downloaded this morning on my Fire. No buttering issues, and very few commercials. Very good for a free app, the only reason i would upgrade is to be able to skip more times per hour. All in all, it made my long day of overtime very pleasant!"
"September 19, 2017","Too many ads"
"January 7, 2014","No tv in my workout room so I turn on Pandora. It is great. Listen to music as I walk ""exercise"". Makes it easier to do my workout."
"February 9, 2013","I use this app on my Kindle Fire as well as my PC and Roku. I absolutely love it! You can create personalized stations and have them on any device you use to play Pandora. Thanks for a great app!"
"November 13, 2015","Vera helpful"
"May 9, 2014","This app works wonderfully, especially the alarm clock feature, best way to wake up to your favorite station hands down!"
"March 30, 2014","I love it. I dont mind the commercials in the free version either. Wishing pandora offered a request line. We use it frequently"
"March 15, 2012","this is the best app on here and who cares it has a few commercials?! it has your favorite songs at your finger tips! stop being haters and whiny babies this app rocks everyone should get it! now quit reading reviews and buy this already!"
"January 11, 2013","Pandora will play one day really well,then the next not so much. I have to keep hitting the internet connection..my computer works fine but sadly Pandora is the only thing that doesn't all the time."
"December 24, 2013","Great Music, good service, no charge! Pandora is easily my favorite App and it does more than "" satisfy "".  Stay the counrse!"
"February 7, 2014","I think Pandora is a good app to listen to music with but sometimes the app acts all stupid and wont play your stations but not always."
"September 28, 2015","Pooooooooping awsome"
"April 9, 2012","Pandora will not let me create an account. My birthday was not correct and I don't know how else I can do it so I just uninstalled this app. If you are looking for a good radio station app, then get I heart radio. I give I five stars."
"September 23, 2015","I love it its so good"
"December 26, 2012","well it only can switch the song six times.and Thar's not enough and they play bad music sometimes it depends also like if I had today's hits on then country music would play to kinda on that station"
"September 2, 2012","I think that Pandora is one of the best apps for music because of all the choices and all the easy searches. you get to chose whatever you want and it can be any of the genres you enjoy listening to its a great app."
"July 1, 2014","Great variety on all my stations, best thing to tune into while cruiz'en down the road on my bike. trying to consistently find a radio station gets very annoying considering most radio stations play the same crap over and over again. in my opinion Pandora has made music watch more enjoyable to listen towith being able to go as far back in music as I choose to."
"June 5, 2014","It's fun to build your stations, and neat how Pandora throws in different music. Runs well in the background too."
"June 2, 2012","I love how it has every type of music and even comedy I listen to Daniel Tosh radio all the time and they even have really obscure artists. I have tried all the other radio apps and this one really stands out to me as the best."
"March 18, 2013","Best app ever! It is great that you don't have to pay for radio. it is easy all you do to sing up is just put your first or last name then your email after that you just put your birthday"
"September 14, 2017","Love my music especially Pandora"
"May 29, 2013","Okay mobile version of Pandora, however it skips every other song that comes on. It's very annoying. I have gone through several updates hoping that it would be fixed. No luck."
"March 30, 2014","Enjoy listening to Pandora while entertaining guest. I don't have to worry about music selection once I choose a station....."
"October 18, 2015","Sdededdefededwd"
"December 20, 2013","Seems to be an android phone app they just ported over to kindle. Could have more data and better layout but it's just bigger."
"February 1, 2015","This app is amazing! It's easy to use and you can listen to anything. I do think you should be able to skip more."
"December 20, 2011","This station is very easy to access and allows you to here a variety of different songs. One area I think this sight would benefit from. If people were allowed to pay to download by the song also select a specific song by an artist to listen too."
"June 12, 2014","Great listening to pandora cuz' you can refine your music choices. I wish they can stay connected all the time."
"June 5, 2015","Works well with many different stations :-)"
"December 1, 2013","I listen to it every day. It always plays the best music.If you press the don't like button it will never play it again. It is the best app ever."
"December 29, 2013","I love to paint while listening to Pandora. I am 64 and my friend is 12. We always choose Pandora for our inspiration music while painting."
"May 23, 2012","I love this app so so much I can listen to music where ever I want in my house.I can listen to it when I'm in the bed or getting up and getting ready for school.the app works great. I hole that every body will get this app!!!!!"
"February 24, 2014","Love it. Can Pick my favorites. I love older Country and it is impossible here to get a radio station with the classics."
"February 6, 2014","sometimes I wish we can pick certain songs, or replay a song. listen to this app all day long. love it. like music? get this app!! (:"
"June 1, 2013","i really wished this app had a history button. had a song stuck in my head for weeks i cant remember the lyircs but i know of it. good though. request. history button please."
"May 26, 2013","The wide selection of music available and the ability to create your own personal genre and musician stations are awesome. I just wish I could skip more than 6 songs per hour."
"April 13, 2014","I love it. It's so handy. I can listening to it any place and time. I just love it. But I don't like how it uses manatice"
"March 25, 2014","even though I am not paying the $3.99 the commercials are few in between! very seldom do I have connection problems...."
"October 11, 2013","I love to listen to Pandora I have it on my smart phone to. I love to listen to Pandora when I take jogs and exersise I love it because it's. free!! :)"
"March 20, 2016","Once you create stations, like, and, dislike songs, it repeats the same song entirely to often. I think this will be my last year paying for commercial free. I think I'm going to try Amazon next."
"May 17, 2014","I like pandora. It really works for me the only thing is I need WiFi for it and i wish incident need WiFi to work."
"November 3, 2013","it is not good for me or my children. I got it for my child and they did not know the first thing on what to do.also I got a ton of spam on my email"
"June 2, 2014","so fantastic to select and artist and have any similar genre just come up! love it! so easy to set up and go!"
"March 16, 2014","I like the ""short"" commercials. The selections are great and the suggested additional artists is a help for me also."
"December 31, 2013","I love that it works on a genre basis, but sometimes you just want to hear a specific song.... and you can't look up specifics on Pandora."
"June 2, 2012","at first when my friend offered it I wasn't sure like almost everything else now adays I thought it would need facebook or twitter I don't have both gladly. I love Pandora and I'm sure you will to especially. since its free!"
"May 16, 2012","I LOVE PANDORA. IF YOU LIKE A CERTAIN TYPE OF MUSIC, IT WOULD PLAY RELATED SONGS STYLE. WHATEVER MOOD YOU ARE IN, JUST SELECT A SONG, AND IT WOULD KEEP YOU SATISFIED. I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH PANDORA WHEN I LISTEN."
"June 10, 2014","I love this app . If you put in a song or artist in it will bring up songs you love or will love. I <3 it."
"January 7, 2013","I love it my kid's  adore it I have no problm with Pandora I get every station I want and I've found new artist. I even buy music from here but don't take my word 4 it. go get it it's free."

"May 16, 2012","I like this app, but I want to be able to skip more songs (because of some random artists) and sometimes I have an occasional freeze-up. I tried Slacker and Iheartradio, and Pandora won my opinion.   - Courtney D."
"December 25, 2011","This app is my least favorite app. It always sends me annoying emails, even though I deleted it months ago because of them. Also, it doesn't let you access many songs. I would give it 0 stars if possible."
"April 12, 2012","Good mixes, good variety for the most part. I would suggest a sleep timer to allow listening at night or for short periods. BTW: Hey, freeloaders, pay for it and you won't have to listen to commercials (wow, what a concept)."
"March 7, 2015","I like the variety I can attain as well as the sleep timer"
"December 31, 2012","I don't get why Pandora is sooo popular! A. You need WiFi, which the Kindle Fire doesn't always have. B. You need an account. C. Only plays music it thinks you like. WASTE OF MEMORY STORAGE! -DJ"
"January 21, 2014","Love all the underground tunes and there's a great variety of genres as well. The absence of advertising is my most favorite feature."
"April 5, 2013","this is the BEST APP EVER!!!!!!! I highly recommend this to anyone who already has a Pandora account. (I don't know what else to call it) ABSOLUTELY IN LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!"
"January 5, 2013","You create your own stations and they list the lyrics for the current song playing. The free version runs adds but I don't find it to be a problem. Really can't complain after all it is free."
"January 26, 2013","I would give pandora 10 stars. I have siriusxm and it doesn't compare. You can select the artiste or type of music and it will play so much better than listening to music you don't care for."
"October 26, 2012","Pandora is a cool app. Problem with current promotion is that it will auto renew each month unless you cancel it. Personally it's s not $3.99 a month ....good! Seems like a sneaky way to get subscribers."
"December 8, 2013","We Love the variety of the music and the ability to select the type of music you would like. It's very easy!"
"October 3, 2013","I used to have a smart phone a few years ago. Pandora was all I used it  for. Gave the phone away. Now I have another and Pandora is my first app."
"June 24, 2013","I hate Pandora they say they have unlimited music but they don't have a limit for the music so I got spotify"

"November 20, 2016","All good"
"June 24, 2016","its ok but it keeps going to a loading screen after the first 5 songs then would not let me do anything else and when I'm not at home but have wifi it says ""sorry but couldn't connecct"". fix this and I will get ""pandora"" on every device I own."
"September 23, 2012","I love music. Pandora has new bands I haven't heard and bands that I haven't listened to in ages. I always listen to this at lunch when they play One Direction in the cafeteria. Officially my favorite app!"
"January 23, 2014","I love Pandora. However, my fire updated it today, and I lost the sleep timer and alarm clock function. Why did you get rid of it?"
"September 19, 2013","I love this app! It works perfectly fine on my kindle fire with the update. I honestly love pandora so for all the music lovers out there get the app!"
"October 6, 2012","You can listen to radio right on your device but u have to have WIFI so instead of buying a radio you can you can save money by downloading this free app and add stations and pick any music to listen to."
"August 13, 2014","old school street songs l used to like to listen to like the song Mary Jane it make me happy."
"March 21, 2013","I put in my favorite artist and it played ALL of the songs I love from other artists. Best music app ever. Especially if you pay for the good version, totally worth 3.99 a month!"
"March 12, 2014","I love this app absolute fav music app they have in the app store must get or you will not find any other great music app"
"July 20, 2012","Pandora is a great way to listen to music but I don't like that example:if u click on Chris brown you hear trey songs like if I click on a certain artist that's all I want to hear tbh but its not s bad app to have"
"September 18, 2017","I enjoy the different kinds of music available."
"July 2, 2012","don't download this crap. iHeart Radio is so much better! What happen you to you, Pandora? You deceased (is that how you spell? whatever) over the year. take some action or take some kick butt from another radio co."
"April 28, 2012","I love it I hear the music I wanna hear but it doesn't have a never play this artist button like slacker so when Nickleback Or Daughtry comes on I have to thumb them down plus the ads kinda bug me. other than that I love it"
"November 20, 2012","I used Pandora everyday and heard all the music I wanted. now they updated it and I rarely hear the artists I want. plus they update every other week. I wish it would go back to what it used to be...."

"June 7, 2017","I love the unlimited songs and NO commercials on the premium package-non stop music from any genre I feel like- it's wonderful!!!"
"May 1, 2013","it is awesome but I cant figure how to stop it from playing when I'm done. its like a radio you don't really get to choose the song you want but yo get to choose a station"
"March 29, 2012","i love this app don't get me wrong. but it would be a lot better IMO if i can check my bookmarked music and delete them because you can NOT do it on this version of Pandora other then that its a great way to get into new music"
"December 28, 2012","I don't download music from itunes for my ipad. Pandora is my go to for music. With limitless channels for my favorite artists, I can match my mood at the moment. I highly recommend Pandora."
"September 6, 2017","Love!"
"September 26, 2015","Works for me"
"November 27, 2013","Pandora is awesome. The radio will basically set it self up with your favorite songs. All you have to do is give it the thumbs up or down."
"March 11, 2014","This is a great app but you cannot just hear random music you have to create stations and the app only plays that music."
"September 8, 2013","Pandora is better than iheart radio by a longshot. Pandora is much easier to navigate through. Also Pandora now has a sleep timer which is FANTASTIC!!!"
"December 21, 2016","I understand that ads are necessary for a free service, but they are way to many lately. The music stations are very good and customize well."
"September 28, 2012","this app is so awesome I could scream. I mean the haters gonna hate and if you don't like this app, who cares if you do or not. don't be hateful, be grateful for at least they gave us a radio app. jeesh"
"December 6, 2014","Music lovers will love this app. Create your own stations, and the music that plays on the station's is related to that station. This is an amazing app if you don't want to listen to the normal radio. You can also skip songs, but you have a limit unless you upgrade. But I find switching the station's until I find the song I like, quite easy."
"January 27, 2013","Pandora gives me the music I like without having buy and download hundreds of different songs. I had a satellite radio account for many years but find Pandora to be superior in content."
"March 13, 2013","tho is the best app severe because you can lessen to music wile doing other things. so do you see why its the best app ever?"
"October 16, 2015","Awesome"

"April 19, 2012","I reccomend this app for anyone! It has a hugr variety of music and is free! You can create as many different stations as you want and there are way less commercials then the radio! I love this app and use it all the time!"
"November 4, 2012","I love Pandora it only has commercial like once every 5 songs!! I love Pandora and it plays all of my favorite songs. I love how it has different genres so u don't have to listen to stupid songs!!"
"March 26, 2014","Pandora is cool because you can type in a type of music style but every time I listen to my music it is always slow."
"February 9, 2013","Really like this app. I have it on my TV, Kindle Fire and phone. I like how you can give songs a thumbs up or down, so they get to know what style of music to add to your playlist."
"May 8, 2013","love it don't listen to anybody else app works just fine.. the only thing I don't like is in free version of it they limit your lisioning time to so many hours per month"
"December 27, 2013","I love this. It is free. You pick a arist stashion. If you do not like the song then dislike it. They will not play the song again."
"January 25, 2012","I use Pandora for the computer and Kindle Fire. I love it. Just absolutely love it!!! Personally, I think anyone who likes or loves music should get this. Great for listening to YOUR type of music but really wish it was ad free. XD"
"November 8, 2017","Love it."
"March 5, 2012","I love Pandora because you can put in what kind of music you like, then it will offer songs, if you don't like the song, thumbs down! but if you do then give it a thumbs il. i don't know why there are so many bad reviews!!!???"
"May 30, 2014","I have only county music but only if worked when u didn't. have wifi only if it would play newer music."
"April 9, 2014","I don't know. Have not used it yet. Too complicated. Takes too much time. Make it easier and faster. Thanks."
"January 1, 2014","it is nice accessing my pandora account on my kindle but this app will not open and i have to restart my kindle and then open it."
"December 3, 2011","Have run this on Kindle Fire without a problem. Ads don't cause any big deal. Run the music as background while reading. Don't see any of the ads. The audio ones are not that bothersome. Have also run Pandora on my computers. ENJOYABLE!"
"October 7, 2012","it is a great way of listening to my favorite music all the others apps I have tried didn't work and my you tube doesn't want to work I recommend it for kindle fire users and I phone users great app"
"September 25, 2015","Real good"
"December 18, 2011","Have this on my Kindle Fire and it works pretty well, easy to search and make a station. No real complaints and I don't need to go searching for the last place I left my iPod. Definitely a must download for music lovers on the cheap."
"April 23, 2014","I love Pandora. Wish they would go back to an annual subscription fee so tracking of payment would not needed"
"May 18, 2012","Great app for streaming internet radio. Fast, reliable and have available tons of options for listening. Except for the minor interpretations for ads and the limitation on skipping songs it's worth the download."
"February 23, 2012","I LOVE THIS APP. YOU CAN DO OTHER THINGS WHILE LISTENING TO SOME GREAT MUSIC OF YOUR CHOICE ( LIKE PINK FLOYD.) I JUST NEED BETTER HEADGEAR. NO COMMERCIALS ON AIR BUT YOU DO GET ADDS POP-UPS. I AM OFF PLAYING GAMES ANYWAY!"

"November 16, 2012","well I know Im never buying a song again. if I had to say something bad it would be that u cant replay otherwise I LUV this thing I use it ALL the time!get it. I promise its worth every penny"
"February 24, 2014","unlimeted stations great songs good overall feel my entire family loves it and i would recomend it for anyone cool app"
"June 8, 2013","What I highly dislike is having to say ""still listening"". You would think that after paying for 1yr. subscription not only eliminating the commercial you would get at least 8-10 hrs of listening time instead of a couple hrs. Really gets irritating to constantly having to do that. Also every once in awhile I can hear 2 stations playing at the same time so I have to shut down my device & restart."
"November 20, 2015","Love listening to the music"
"August 19, 2012","yhu guys say that it plays the same commercial.... so what.??? its a commercial when yhur in the car the same commercial plays overall.... and after a few seconds into the commercials yhu can skip it..."
"May 27, 2013","I love Pandora but it has limet on free music per month and will force you to pay for the ad free on and is completely free on computer and phone not kindle fire."
"June 13, 2015","Every day, morning to night."
"October 22, 2011","Pandora for Android has been around for quite some time....long enough for me to get fed up with all the skipping and switch to iheartradio. I wish the app was more consistent, because Pandora really is a great thing, even with the ads."
"September 15, 2015","Love it."
"July 10, 2013","I like Pandora they have every song!!!! you should get this app!!!! I'm glad people created it or else I wouldn't be able to listen to music all the time!"
"March 9, 2012","its great I love it but one thing that bothers me is ill have a Chris brown station then all of I sudden I hear Justin bieber. I wish it would just play songs from whatever artist ur station is. other than that its great!"
"March 1, 2014","Great suggestions on like artists. Helped widen my horizon on music. The format is very easy to understand and use."
"January 31, 2014","Love Pandora but I hate the app. 9 out of 10 times it hangs at the logo screen and I have to reboot. Please fix this."
"July 28, 2015","Pandora is awesome"

"January 5, 2014","this app is great the one problem is on the road u do not have internet so u can not listen to music otherwise it is awesome"
"November 9, 2012","I love this app! I listen to it all day long! I don't even watch Tv anymore! It picks music exactly to my taste and I just love it! GET IT NOW! WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS REVIEW??? GO!"
"June 10, 2013","this is ok but way too many adds and you can only skip six times its not free u end up paying 99 cents per month and more for Pandora one .... such a rip off."
"May 14, 2013","its so cool I love it and I cant use me email so I used my biyfriends instead I love it I love how they have ever band I can think of Pandora is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!"

"December 30, 2013","Allows me to easily hear tunes I appreciate almost without effort. Also, expands the norm comfortably. What more need I say?"
"November 29, 2013","I liked the ability to set up my own music desires, and Pandora did a good job of figuring out what I really did like with subsequent selections."
"July 19, 2012","I don't understand why people don't like this app! Its a free app where you can listine to music you love! Sure there's an ad every 3 songs but its only barely 30 seconds! People are so picky about apps!"
"February 2, 2014","Take with you wherever there's a hotspot! I love keeping my same channels wherever I go! Bonus, bonus, bonus, bonus..."
"July 14, 2012","i purchase4d my kindle fire, I live in Ecuador but when I purchased, no indications that some of the apps don't work in my country. Pandora does'nt as well as games like Sudoku. I think that I should have been advised that some of the applications don't work ourtside US.

"April 2, 2014","As great a resource for music lovers Pandora is, some things aren't as great. For example, the first thing you want to hear on johnny cash radio is not the whatshisface impersonator guy from the I Walk The Line sound track. And today, it seemed the only Chubby Checkers, The Twist track miss Pandora could find was from THE SON OF MASK SOUNDTRACK!!!!! WHYYYYYIZSSSITLIKETHIS?????"

"June 20, 2012","This is a really cool app! But there's a few downs. . . You can only skip songs six times in an hour, and after a few songs, ads come up. Other than that, I would recommend this app to music lovers! (:"
"December 15, 2014","A nice touch to my phone."
"February 22, 2012","This app works great, I am using a droid 3 and have no complaints. People on here complaining about ads, should drop the 36 bucks for the year, or uninstall. The world doesn't have the time to listen to your whining."

"September 2, 2014","I always liked Pandora. I mostly listen to Rock and music from the 70's and 80's. I don't mind the occasional commercial. But for some reason i'm getting slammed with Spanish commercials all the time. Very annoying. Removed It from all my devices."
"February 6, 2014","Love this app. Can listen on my iPhone synced to by Bluetooth on my car. I listen to this rather than the radio."

"November 3, 2012","Pandora, yes is good for listening to music but only 6 skips..adds all the time..and other bad things. The main reason I HATE Pandora..it KILLS your battery. And if you ever forget to complety turn the whole application off then it stays on and you don't even know it unroll you battery goes from completely full ti completely empty in an hour. So, if you want your battery ti be ruined, get it. Otherwise DONT."
"August 27, 2015","good"

"November 25, 2011","Im a Paying subscriber to the Pandora service, I wont be at the end of this subscription. the app is clunky and the music stops and starts it needs to buffer vastly more of each song so there are less issues with playback."

"March 19, 2016","Only fix on latest gen 2016 $50 tablet is to uninstall and reinstall. Pain in the ass. Neither Pandora or Amazon give enough of a carp to address it. Disappointing."

"April 5, 2013","this is the best app made for the kindle fire. I <3 radio only lets you have a daily amour of skips, while Pandora lets you have a certain amour per hour, on each channel. like I said, best app made for music/industrial manners."
"February 27, 2013","Have used Pandora on Kindles since 2011. Unfortunately, their recent updates now have the program always running in the background. Even running ´Gemini´ type tools is not enough to keep the program terminated....Memory  Is consumed. Have taken the step of uninstalling the App."
"February 25, 2012","Sounds great on my kindle fire, played for over 4 hours straight with only 3 commercials! Will use over and over ! Recommend to all."

"August 26, 2012","love this app you can listan to your favorite type or artist with limited adds and throw best part its free!!!!!"
"February 5, 2012","my best friends brother showed me this.he said it was good. I tried it and I'm glad that I did! just don't bite it. it will break then."
"July 11, 2012","Hi!Pandora is awesome you get all kinds of music . its also nice to have in the gym . enjoy! bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'''"
"October 24, 2011","I didn't really like the way Pandora chose music for me. I'd try to get it to go more toward my genre, but it inevitably would veer off toward another genre and toward music I wasn't interested in. It also set up ""stations"" too frequently.  I ended up deleting Pandora, and will have to find another app which suits me more."
"September 25, 2017","I don't know what's going on lately but it will play one song then buffer for eternity. Very disappointing."
"September 26, 2012","Pandora is really really cool......it has really good songs and it is really fun to listen to when ur bored"

"November 29, 2012","I love Pandora but I updated it and it pauses almost every 2 songs wish I could un-do the update.."
"February 2, 2012","The only reasons it didn't get 5 stars is because you should get more skips and on my kindle I cant figure out how to turn it off. Lol"
"May 2, 2012","This service is wonderful, I have found many small circulation songs that I never would have guessed would be on their list."
"December 16, 2011","If you've got a Kindle Fire, forget this app. It works on all of my other devices (iPhone, iPad, Windows 7 laptop, and Mac mini). Bummer."
"September 26, 2012","Pandora is my favorite app! its the best way to listen to music if you don't want to pay to download music"

"September 26, 2012","I love Pandora! Don't get ride of it!!! It's the best I can listen to MY own personal music that I love:)"
"April 14, 2017","If you don't know what Pandora is by now, you probably shouldn't get it."

"January 9, 2015","Great app especially if you pay the extra 5 bucks a month for the plus edition. I know their margins are really high on the premium edition and as a whole they play really predictable music but to my knowledge no other app or program in general offers a comparable service. Who can beat Pandora?"
"August 2, 2012","amazing listened to it on a trip for 10 hours there and back its really that good. I would highly recommend it"
"May 10, 2012","I like this app because it is like a radio channal but if u don't like the song u can change it with a push of a button."

Music selection is pretty good, it mostly give me stuff i like but it still throws in some clunkers,(more than I'd like).

"March 19, 2016","I love pandora I just wish they had more songs of the actual artist other than artist who make songs related to or sound like the artist other than that I love it"
"August 6, 2012","This app is terrible! It never lets me finish the songs I hear and once I put thumbs down for a song it plays it again. Not to mention all the annoying advertisements and frequent buffering...waste of time."
"February 6, 2012","I like dis pretty nuch u get da songs u wanna here and not some rondom on asked for song."
"August 28, 2013","Terrible, can't get passed 3 songs without a commercial. Years ago it was much better. Where's the alternative? And the limitations on skipping are terrible."

"April 10, 2013","I love One Direction and I love to listen to their songs, but they play Justin Beiber, Taylor Swift, ext. I wish they would only play the songs artist of genre you asked for. Besides that little problem, I would love this app."
"September 12, 2017","Just love all the different genres of music!!!!"
"July 1, 2013","it's good but pandora curses. you can also only have a certain amount of skips but it is ok. i do like how you can create stations and flip through them. you can also use it on the interweb which is also very helpful"
"January 15, 2012","The first time I opened it, it closed by it self. the second time it worked fine. the third time it ccomes up to the loading page but never goes any further! I love Pandora but. for some reason it's not working right for me! I hope this gets fixed! :("

"December 14, 2012","I agree with everyone else, the app stops playing and doesnt start back up, I thought I was having issues with my kindle until I started reading the reviews, Thanks everyone!!"
"January 22, 2013","this app worked fine on my tablet in the beginning, but it won't switch stations, or when I press 'more' to read lyrics and whatnot, nothing happens. incredibly annoying."
"September 13, 2017","Love it!"
"February 24, 2012","It Sucks. I like I heart radio better. To many adds. Buffing takes so looooooong. I'm unstalling. And it repeats."

"April 10, 2012","I loved Pandora until they started bombing me with Barack Hussein Obama proproganda every few songs.... forced me to delete the app. Highly illegal considering the Equal Time laws..."
"September 14, 2017","Love my Pandora music. They give you the option to go ad free for a small monthly fee. If you like to find a channel to help you sleep, Get the Liquid Mind station!!"
"January 13, 2012","I wish I could remove this app from my list. especially since it is not part of the kindle rom and I will never download it.  besides, I've been a rhapsody customer since 2002. I'm not likely to switch to this crap now."
"January 22, 2013","This is a great app. It. lets you listen to music for free and you can still hear that song again by liking it. You can hear your favorite artist's songs without hearing the same song three million times. This is a BIG must have app."
"April 16, 2017","I love this, I can listen all my favorite artists and find new ones! The reason for the 4 star is because it skips songs by itself and that's really annoying when it's one of my favorites... otherwise it's Amazing!!"

"April 12, 2012","I have had Pandora for about 4 monthes now and it has been great...untill now. I turn it on and it goes to my station screen and..just..stops. I even deleted it and downloaded it again and still nothing. so if you are wanting to listen to music without it messing up, don't waste your time with this app."
"April 10, 2013","So when I first downloaded the app I LOVED it. Then I updated it and it told me that I have exceeded the amount of hours I can listen to the radio this month and its only a week into April. now I have to pay monthly to listen to the music with unlimited hours. Or I pay. 99 cents for the rest of the month. what happened to Pandora:("

"May 19, 2012","that's not cool. I put my email address and everything else in correctly numerous times and it continued to tell me ""you are unable to create a Pandora"""
"December 1, 2012","I love pandora and it has saved all the music radio stations I like. This app has all the features you get on a desktop. Lets u minimize it and continue to use other apps. Works great!!"
"June 28, 2013","Pandora has good music but the commercial's after almost every song is awful! It ruins the listening experience. They need to figure out another way to make money!"
"July 16, 2016","Great for the most part. I can live with the ads in the free version. Some of my play lists, blues, ended up with Christmas songs I couldn't get rid of. Satisfied"

"June 9, 2012","really now, why does this app want to read my contacts, access my phone state, and write to my calendar? get rid of these ludicrous permissions or provide a sufficient explanation for them, and then i'll reconsider a better review. until then, you get nothing."
"December 19, 2012","best app Ever I'm 11 and when I want to listen yo Justin bieber I can tugs the best and ads are kinds annoying but thy doesn't it is a five star app!!!!!"

"July 1, 2012","Spotify is way better. Pandora has really lost its touch over the years. Only 6 skips per hour? That's ridiculous! I'm going to uninstall and go back to Spotify."
"November 23, 2012","ad, song, ad, crash, ad, crash, song. the older versions of the app worked very well, but now it never even finishes a song. the app has gone to trash."

"April 29, 2013","All I wanted to do was listen to some music while at the hospital. So I downloaded Pandora. AND IT WON'T EVEN START!!!!!! Fix it."
"July 19, 2017","I could not download"
"November 18, 2012","Pandora was once a wonderful way to listen to music. Now between every couple of songs there's a huge pause. Not seconds long but minutes long. Then there's an ad. I don't mind ads but I do mind the minutes of silence. I get that they want you to upgrade and pay them but if the free version with ads is this poor then they should only offer the subscription."
"March 8, 2013","i want to like this app , but its worthless. i got it on my kindle fire and i play it put it in sleep mode it will play couple songs then stop. i unsleep my kindle and the app will be asking if im still listening."
"December 14, 2013","I am shocked they would run ads for an oil company that dumped all that oil near Valdez, Alaska in 1989. How am I supposed enjoy music with their disgusting label looking right at me? If that is a ploy to force us to sign up for the ad free version, they'd are sorely mistaken. I am now looking for a different source of music."
"February 7, 2012","I downloaded this for my kids that I babysit l. I added a. baby song for toddlers and I' m sexy and I know it can on!"
"July 18, 2017","Performs as expected"

"January 13, 2017","Not available in my country what a waste"
"December 18, 2011","terrible design. it is entirely unclear how to add channels and work with the app besides simply playing a station. this is a case of less is less."
"November 23, 2011","I have had a subscription to Pandora for about 3 years. Before it was so I could use it on my computer, but now that I have it on my phone I love it. I have created a variety of stations, and enjoy the new music that comes up that I might not have thought of before. If you don't like the song that comes on, just vote it down and it won't play again.  Those complaining about the ads, there is a simple fix - buy the subscription. It is only $36 a year, well worth it."
"March 28, 2013","this thing is changing and not for the better. its not gonna be free anymore. 3.99 a month? aint nobody go time for that."
"December 17, 2012","Way better. Jango took too long to load and only gave u five skips an hour! This is superior to every other music app out there!"
"June 17, 2012","doesn't work at all and its really slow and asks u for all this facebook stuff. DONT GET THIS APP"
"February 14, 2013",". If you're use to Pandora you will love this app. Pandora will let you hear music and create stations. I am a Pandora user and this app works fine."

"December 31, 2011","if gave this a bad review, u need a life. this app is amazing. so what if it has adds, Tv has comersials so do u hate Tv to? This app rocks!"

"April 19, 2013","like very clear plays great songs. I like that you can pick your own songs. and skip the songs you don't like."
"April 7, 2012","you have to pay the fee for like 36 dollars per year!I have I heart radio and it is a ton better. I don't understand the five star people!"
"September 25, 2012","at first I liked this app but then my sister recommend JANGO. it has great songs and you can skip it as many times as you like.   -kiley"
"September 24, 2012","Used to be good, but has evolved to play too many ads, ads are too loud, ads take up most of the screen. Would buy an ad-less app, but they don't sell one; they sell a monthly ad-less subscription. LAME!"
"November 15, 2011","How could anything free be any better? I believe this is worth paying for if the adds bother you. You will find similar music to what you select and may find artists you were not aware of."
"April 17, 2013","this is the best music app ive ever used and I love it!!! when I'm home and bored I am always using it! :)"
"October 17, 2011","Tracks basically everything on your phone, from phone calls, txts to gps location and more. There are better Internet streaming radio apps on Android Marketplace or Amazon Appstore that do not do that. Don't waste your time with this one."
"October 7, 2012","because it dose not let me enter my birth date and so every tin Elmer I try It dose not work and that is why I hats it"
"January 31, 2013","GREAT app. Listen to Pandora everywhere I go on my Fire. No lag, no problems. no idea why its not at a 5 star rating. Oh! Yea. Trolls."

"November 28, 2011","This was clicked accidentally and now I am stuck with it on the carousel! Too easy to do---watch what you click when adding apps."
"June 4, 2017","Couldn't even sign up. ""Sorry, not excepting sign ups right now"". Then why do you bother being available to people who DON'T know that...common sense. I tried several times but nothing happened."
"April 6, 2012","updte-access to my contacts, no freaking way. Been listening for about as long as this company's been online. NO MORE!!!"
"March 12, 2013","ward slap paper awesome app love the music mama I wish u could add more things to your profile though"
"February 18, 2013","I like making up my own mix of music. I wish I could delete more of the suggested music so I can add more of what I like to one place."
"April 15, 2012","Sub-par I don't use it for much because the music it reccomends isn't very accurate to my taste. Not a very good app."
"November 14, 2013","This is a rip off because as soon as I got loged in it said can't take my login at this time and I just got it.so don't even think about getting this app because it is a rip off. I should not given it one star."
"May 7, 2016","It was so cool to listen to music for free."

"January 19, 2012","I think I Heart radio is much better it may have comerciqls but they play great songs and it doesn't fail"
"October 13, 2012","Pandora has totally ruined it for me. I personnaly think they destroyed their app- Pandora; say goodbye to another User."
"March 15, 2013","DONT BE FOOLED!!!!! I used to love Pandora of course because it always played awesome songs that I would fall I love with but major problem.

BEWARE OF PAYMENT FEES!!!!!!!"

"December 28, 2011","Completely dead on Kindle Fire, no music plays at all. going to have to try alternatives now. Pandora has really gone downhill."
"July 2, 2012","I am not too thrilled with this app. I'm constantly getting error messages on my Kindle. I try to download songs and errors keep popping up."
"April 8, 2012","there is one one huge problem with this app and other than that I love it.it never plays the right song"
"September 28, 2012","Either the upgrade to 1.7.1 or some change on the hosting side caused the audio to lose all the highs. I thought my tweeters were busted at first but no, every other audio application sounds fine. The music barely sounds like it's in stereo any longer. And why would a music player need to read my phone state (which includes the phone numbers of who is calling). Pandora is going the way of Netflix, losing customers by dropping service quality."
"December 22, 2011","This apps does not work, at all. Just a blue screen :(. It is impossible to get pass the starting screen. Thus, impossible to say any thing else."
"September 14, 2017","I would rate it a five if I could get onto it. It won't let me open on my Fire. I'd really like to hear my thumbprint radio."
"July 18, 2017","Love the music!!"
"January 25, 2017","On startup just shows a failed connection error"
"September 19, 2012","...and I can't imagine why anyone would let you. these permissions are insane. I absolutely do NOT agree, this app is mediocre at best... yes, Pandora was soooo cool a few years ago, but we have slacker and spotify and 8tracks and so much more now. certainly not worth all this hassle to hear commercials and out-of-date indie rock."
"January 1, 2012","like beyonce cause she.is a great singer and she where nice close and she having.Baby I. remember that when she was young she became destiny child three girls but.two left then they found a.new two girls.one. left so now.it was two when they was.doing.there on.thang they.came.back. so now there no.more destiny child."
"January 15, 2012","I love being able to thumb down songs on the stations I listen to & then never have to listen to those songs ever again on my radio. Got so addicted that I subscribed & now I don't have to listen to commercials either."

"November 21, 2012","You can listen to 2 songs and the it just stops! It is so annoying because this is a really good music station and i thought i would have a good music station. I'm very disappointed! :("
"January 31, 2017","If I pay for the monthly fee why am I limit to one person only? I really dislike this update. Please change it back. I should be getting full access if I'm paying."
"December 14, 2016","Cannot register."
"June 14, 2017","I tryed to sign up to Pandora but it did not let me so I tryed again a few months later and it still had the same problem."
"January 12, 2012","this is sad I live in in Tijuana and can not use because it cant be used in this country¡!!!!!!!"
"July 17, 2017","It always says that I can't find a connection so I have to press retry like 5 times before it actually works, then its really laggy. And every time I try to have it in the background so I can hear music while using another app it quits working. Overall as much as I like Pandora I'll just stick with Spotify it doesn't have any of these issues"
"March 25, 2016","This is A-W-E-S-O-M-E. You can make your own music stations and they are unlimited. And you can Like and unlike. And you don't have to get more and more updates."
"January 12, 2012","I thought this wasn't supposed to have ads. aside from quite a lot of buffering if I try and change the song and the ads at the bottom its pretty great."
"June 1, 2016","An amazing app overall. One issue though. Wverytime I try to browse music, it crashes. Please fix. Otherwise, I totally recommend it."
"October 7, 2017","The reason I gave 2 stars is because whenever I type a song name or the artist I don't get the song or artist I want so plz fix it only works on my phone I'm on tablet"
"January 15, 2012","this app is so useful and amazing it lets you listen to music you like .... its User friendly and an all around  good time!!!!"
"November 28, 2012","pandora has been great for 2 years but this week it plays one song when i first start it then it hangs there and does not play any more songs."
"October 17, 2011","I would give this nine stars, just like the nine nine nine plan. The 999 plan replaces the tax code with the simple but effective 999 plan. Pandora is great because it shows you new artists like the ones you love"
"January 6, 2013","The music that the kids listen to these days can be used through this app but I would also like to use it one day."
"April 8, 2013","love to listen to music especially when I'm working and you can pick whatever kind of music you like to listen to"
"January 9, 2012","I would choose a song and it would go to a different fricken band then I went the unistall Icon"
"August 28, 2017","Would give 5 stars but the app is super out dated on kindle fire HDX and super glitchy. Please fix"
"December 26, 2016","Pandora you made playing songs to complicated! I can't play sucker for pain! It just keeps playing other songs (pls add a search button) The A- Will turn to a A plus if you add a play song button"
"February 1, 2012","This tablet is being changed to block my ability to access websites I prefer. I find your Pandora app to inferior to access Pandora radio as I do on my computer. I much more prefer to avoid your app and deal directly with Pandora. I was able to do so without android download. Why do I need to go thru amazon now when I have avoided in the past? Amazon should leave well enough alone."
"November 8, 2016","Love pandora"
"March 25, 2016","Works great I get all the music that I like"
"April 10, 2016","It exits the app after I listen to it for 30 to 45 minutes, I have to reopen and can't continue listening to the song that was playing before! If you fix this then I will gladly give a five star rating!"
"June 10, 2017","Use pandora every day. For driving to work, relaxing at home, partiea. Any day, every day, any time. Great app, wide selection!"
"December 1, 2011","Navigation quirky. Ads all-pervasive. Sound quality mediocre. Maybe good if you're already a Pandora fan. Otherwise, skip it. Uninstalling from my Kindle fire."
"October 30, 2017","I have had Pandora for years never had an issue but ever since the October 12 2017 update all my Pandora does is crash on me after one song!!!! This is very frustrating"
"November 27, 2012","The ad supported Kindle version just does not work reliably. Music stops and I hear nothing but am told that an ad is playing. And music does not return. Not much good in this form."
"November 15, 2011","I used to be a devoted Pandora user, but the app has been on a steady decline. Like other users, I have been having issues hearing complete songs. I've reported the issue and haven't seen any sign of a fix. While the occasional crash was okay, this consistent problem is SO frustrating. So I'm gonna check out Slacker. Sorry Pandora, but your poor response to big problems has lost you another user."
"July 22, 2016","When I enter a email it says its incorrect and I don't think a zip code should be used to login I wish I could rate it 0 stars I can't even sign in"
"November 30, 2012","With the new update, almost every other song it just stops playing music. Sometimes I have to switch stations in order to continue listening to music. It is extremely annoying."
"December 29, 2011","when first started using it, it was good, but the second time it was having problems. When I tried to open it I would just get stuck on the blue Pandora screen, so I reinstalled it only to get another problem. It wouldn't let me find a new station so I only had the first station I looked for,the ice cube station. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with the kindle fire."
"February 9, 2016","I bought Pandora One on my phone.. an HTC One M7, and it will not transfer. I am on a first generation KINDLE Fire."

"December 14, 2016","It randomly cuts on in the middle of the night some times when you unlock my device"
"November 25, 2016","It's compared to Spotify"
"June 1, 2016","After downloading, app requires registration & then requires year of birth and zip code, supposedly 2provide""customized service"", however, after providing the info, a msg appeared stating my registration was not accepted, period! Not""pls try again later"", or""there was a problem...."", just denied&no uninstall option!"
"February 14, 2015","💜"
"December 18, 2016","There are a 2 ads about every 3 songs."
"October 26, 2011","I like Pandora more than Slacker, but Pandora has no ""never play this artist"" feature. So when Brittany Spears comes on, I have to thumbs down her one song versus her entire career."
"March 20, 2016","Every password u type won't work on kindle fire!"
"February 24, 2017","I have paid for Pandora for years. The app will no longer open on my Kindle or my fire stick! Very upset. What's up with that?"
"April 8, 2016","It kind of stinks.😑 I mean I want to be able to pick my songs! 😠Since I can't do that, I'm rating it lower. 😒If the people who made this want me to rate higher, then they should make it possible to pick what you want to listen to.😪🙅 😹😹"
"October 9, 2017","IT PLAYS BTS ANIME MUSIC AND JUST MUSIC AND RIGHT NOW ITS PLAY BEST OF ME FROM BTS AND BEFORE IT PLAY A OTHER SONG FROM BTS AND I LOVE PANADO"
"November 19, 2011","Only plays few seconds of song before skipping to the next. Force closes a lot. Plays a complete commercial every two songs. Since it never completes a song it's all commercial. Deleted (Same problem on non-Amazon version) Droid2Global"
"May 4, 2016","Awesome app"
"July 11, 2016","#black lives matter uninstall"
"November 6, 2011","Plays the same commercial every other song sometimes. The commercial almost as long as the song. The app stops playing anything altogether at times, while draining battery. Most of us have enough music that you shouldn't have to deal with the difficulties this app provides. I've wasted countless hours with Pandora over the past few years on the PC, blackberry, iPad, iPod touch (3RD gen) HTC Evo, and Evo 3D. I'm speaking from extensive experience, Pandora has really turned its back on what it originally set out to be: the music genome project."
"July 29, 2016","It won't let me type my email in and it says it was wrong when I opened the app. I don't even get a chance to sign in it deserves a big fat 0."
"February 23, 2017","Waste of a download. It will not even open up"
"July 11, 2016","Bye Pandora. How about police lives? Guess they don't matter."
"February 28, 2017","It won't even let me sign up!"
"July 11, 2017","It takes to long to lode(dont know how to spell well)!"
"June 11, 2016","I hate this app it sucks!!!!😤😤😧😠😇😭"
"November 23, 2016","I don't want to listen to OTHER PEOPLE'S SONG, I want to listen to MY SONG, so please make a urgent update because it's so annoying to listen a song that yoiu don't want to hear or even know about!! Think about that before publishing a music app!!"
"May 23, 2017","If I could give it zero stars I would because it won't let me download the app"
