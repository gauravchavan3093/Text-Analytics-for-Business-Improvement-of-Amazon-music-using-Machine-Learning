"October 7, 2017","Spotify is way, way, way, way, way, way better music app than Pandora. It doesn't limit you on the musicians you actually like with awful musicians with a few of your favorite songs peppered in between garbage pail cousin music and brown water trash one hit wonders. Spotify let's you play whole albums and let's you make custom and endless playlists."
"April 4, 2017","I love, love, love spotify !!!!! I'm 71 years and no very computer literate, if I can learn Spotify anyone can. I have found songs I used to listen to 55 years ago."
"July 31, 2016","I love this app. I put it on my phone first, but I had so much music it was taking up all the room on my phone. I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version. Either way, you have access to lots of great music from your favorite artists."
"March 7, 2017","I love this app. I've tried them all (apple, amazon, pandora) and nothing compares. The suggestions are awesome, I'm finding new music all the time. Also, you can pick up where you left off on any device. Spotify is the best, period."

"January 11, 2016","Spotify is my go-to streaming app because not only does it allow me to listen to all of my favorites, but it also allows me to personally experience music in a much richer way. I can find music by mood or era, and discover gems I would have never come across by just a simple search. The feature of following other members' extensive playlists is a great way to reconnect with music that has been forgotten over the years. Spotify isn't just a steaming app. It's an experience for a musical connection that I haven't found anywhere else."

"December 27, 2015","There's no reason to NOT get it. All your excuses go out the window now!  On Amazon, compared to Itunes or Google Play, Spotify let's you CHOOSE the song. It lets you CREATE playlists. It lets you SHARE the song...  Spotify has done an excellent job. Although Amazon seems to suck for not having the top app and games like Clash of Clans, everyone can find a way to do that. But exclusively to Amazon, Spotify gave its users the abilities that no other app store is capable of.  All the negative reviews are lies. It's probably something the user did to their device over time(you know what I'm talking about).  I totally recommend this app. Free music for life! Not very many ads, either, which is nice.  Enjoy!"

My children and I share music lists as well as my friend... the magic to choosing a music service is commitment... Pick one and stick with it... choose a model that suits you. The pay version allows you to skip through as many songs as needed to get where you want, the free version after you skip a few it makes you listen to a full song. There is cost associated to the music for the spotify people, so I get that. If it could read my mind, and spur my memory I would give it 6 stars..."

"October 23, 2014","Spotify is truly a unique app in how it not only offers a variety of music, but allows you to personally choose/create your own playlists. Unlike other music services, this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music. I can spend hours a day creating different playlists which help make the work day or study time go by quick. If you enjoy creating your own playlists then this app is for you. If you choose the free version, there are commercials and you are only able to shuffle your playlists. Should you choose the paid version, then it is basically like putting in a cd and hitting play, skip, stop, etc. (I recommend the paid version) If you are a student, there is a student discount basically cutting the month subscription price in half.  Happy Listening Spotifyers! Cheers!"

"December 7, 2015","Super great"
"September 25, 2014","Spotify is amazing. I use this app every single day and I love making various playlists of my favorite musicians and artists. I also love that I can find new music and bands within the same genres, which has turned me on to new music and indie artists that I never would have known about without Spotify. Now I can support these artists by buying merchandise, CDs and going to their concerts. Another cool feature is that you can listen to music offline by downloading the songs to your PC. This means that you can download music to your device at ho,e using your WiFi instead of using up all of your mobile data streaming the songs when you are out. You have to get this app. Spotify rules. It is ABSOLUTELY WORTH GETTING A PRO SUBSCRIPTION!!! It is $9.99 a month, but it is worth it. SPend the money!!! You will not regret it."

"March 6, 2016","I think Spotify is a really good platform for finding and listening to songs. I wish they had access to all musicians and all songs, but their lists have come a long way since the first time I used the service a few years ago. The only thing missing is the ability to easily move a song from one of my playlists to another. Adding a ""Move to"" option in the drop down menu of each song would be a big plus. Also, I don't mind watching an ad every 30 minutes to have this service for free. :)"

"June 16, 2015","Just a few years ago, listening to songs or a genre of music of your choice, meant purchasing lots and lots of music. Here's how I'll put it: Spotify makes me feel rich because l have access to almost all the music that l can ""think of."" And the best part is the cost: which is free. Love it when l (and you) win as we do with this app. I wish most other ""basics"" were just like Spotify! Perhaps a day will come (sooner than later) that disrupt things so that life become an affordable luxury --as Spotify has done for music! Great app!"

"February 2, 2015","Fantastic IF you have the money to pay for premium , otherwise the ads are very annoying . I decided to go for it, as I don't have a very big music collection . It has completely changed my relationship to the music world, although I'm worried that I'm no longer listening to radio at all . They have practically everything I ever look for , and with premium you get excellent quality and no ads . HOWEVER I do think they could do a better job with the Kindle interface , giving you more options for how to organise your library , for example. Mine is getting quickly out of control!"

"December 26, 2014","Very good source of music. Has an almost unlimited collection to choose from. You can create your own playlists or choose from many already set up. Spotify can be used in your computer with no loss of selections made. There are 30 second commercials. There is a prime version that is commercial free. I find it easier to set up playlists and albums to listen to on my computer. Not certain about battery drain, it seems the steaming audio could use up battery life rather quickly. I have been using Spotify on my computer for several years and am happy to have a portable version available."

"September 23, 2014","wonderful selection of music, great that it generates playlists for you based on keywords"
"August 27, 2014","This app is good, the only problems I have with it is the ads, I know since I don't pay for it there's ads but when I'm listening to death metal and deathcore, I don't want to know about the new pop albums, latest one was the new prince album. The point of ads is to help sell your product but if it has no relevants to what I like or even listen to then it has failed its purpose. I think you should have ads based on what you listen to even if that means using peoples saved music to get the idea of what they like. The supply of music on this is great I have found everything I wanted to find and that's better than other apps like Pandora. I get to at least listen to the band I want to even if its not from the same album ( suggested songs take from other albums and play songs from there )"

"February 21, 2015","Works great, few crashes and most of my favorite artists"
"December 15, 2014","This app is simply amazing. It's musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a ""station"" or ""mix"" and that feature is decent. The algorithms aren't great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that don't want to pay for premium service, you don't have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I'm aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you don't need to pay $9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they don't email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I've had my account for 5 months and I don't think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. :)"

"September 27, 2015","EXCELENTE"
"June 30, 2015","Good app for streaming music"
"September 23, 2015","Spotlight was by far my #1 music player until they updated it. Now it's basically Pandora, which sucks. You choose, skip, or listen to a song when you want to. Unless you pay a whopping $10 monthly ($520 a year!), all you can do is shuffle play one genre. That's it. So dumb."
"March 29, 2017","I'm listening to Spotify as I write this, and as a whole it's a good app, even with the new update. There is just one minor problem, their music library is somewhat lacking. Don't take it the wrong way, they have tons of songs and such, but some of the things they call singles are actually quite large albums. I don't appreciate it when I find a song on something like Pandora and want to listen to it again, only to find the album on Spotify has every song except the one I am looking for. Other then that, it's a good music app."
"December 16, 2014","Has a lot of the songs I like, but still missing a lot as well..."

"August 13, 2015","Excellent product."
"March 12, 2016","I really thought it would be good at first because all my friends that had it said it was great. I ended up downloading a few songs and making a playlist, and then I went through a few &#34;top 50&#34; stations and added some more songs. Then its putting in songs on my library that I didn't add, saying recommended song. I want to listen to the songs I added, not some songs that suck that have nothing to do with the type of music I listen to. I just wish it was set up better also. Its really hard to find anything on there, and it gets really frustrating. I also hate that it shuts down right when I open it up. I just hope they fix the bugs soon."

I get to listen to a hundred times more songs, I make my own playlists, and the best part.. ITS FREE (unless you upgrade to the premium) Honestly, I am thinking about upgrading to premium myself, bc it just has a ton of cool qualities.. For one, I think that downloading the playlists of songs of your choice, and being able to listen to it WITHOUT WiFi, is THE BEST THING EVER!!! It's just THT it's on premium.. :/ but the free version is practically amazing in every way except that ONE thing.... ********GeT tHiS aPp RiGhT nOw!¡!¡!¡!¡!"

"November 16, 2016","I'm having the same problem as some other people, the swipe-down-banner-thing doesn't work properly. I can pause the music by pressing the pause/play button, but the UI doesn't update after the first time I press a button. Requires phone restart. Also, just a nitpicky thing: some of the messages for when listening to your daily mix and saving/liking music have the wrong it's. Otherwise, 10/10."

"January 29, 2016","This is my favorite music app! I use it pretty regularly - not daily, but a few days a week. I love the ability to create different playlists. I also love the radio feature (you can create a custom radio station around almost any artist or song) and the ability to customize your radio by giving songs a thumbs up or down.  We also have Bluetooth support in our car radio and often use it to sync our phones and listen to Spotify while riding/driving. The ads can be a little annoying at times, but I understand they have to make money somehow. You usually hear an ad every 3-4 songs."

"July 29, 2014","Spotify is a treasured addition to my computer audio program. I do not yet understand computers well and Spotify regardless, brings me very good music. Spotify also has shown me how to better understand types of grouping I wouldn't have thought of! I very much appreciate the Premiums option of increased digital audio quality and ability to easily interface with useful software currently, I can and often do listen to Spotify music using Jriver mc 19 either, via headphone or preamplifier, There are many such Software options available as trial for you to learn more about music and computer audio. These points are a very basic starting group for Spotify. If you are as new to computer audio as I am, enjoy and slowdown. Lee McDonald a.k.a.GREENSIDEUP"

"May 30, 2015","You can get pretty much any type of music and make a great playlist, but I can't seem to get away from commercials! Maybe there's something I'm doing wrong, but if I play my downloaded songs, even they have commercials every 3 songs. (I suppose I could pay to upgrade and maybe I'd lose the ads, but I'm not willing to do that, as I don't listen to music constantly - or enough to pay a subscription price to go without ads. I'd rather buy a CD if that's the case). I don't like the Playlist Radio, because it plays songs that are nothing like the playlist. It's irritating. The info says that Spotify gets to know what you like, but I have zero Abba songs (and nothing like that on my playlists), but yet what songs do they inject right after the 3d song on my playlist? Some idiocy by Abba, of course. I suppose I was too optimistic in hoping that Spotify was like using your MP3 or iPod. I guess they have to make money somehow. Still, I do enjoy being able to play (somewhat without interruption) a grouping of songs I have chosen."

"February 23, 2015","Best smartphone music app in my opinion"
"November 23, 2014","I have loved Spotify to death on my laptop, (750+ song on several playlists that I use a lot) but the tablet/phone version is terrible. There are ways to get around the shuffle limitation (really, Spotify? Really?) but I shouldn't have to deal with that. I realize that I'm not paying, but I shouldn't have to be. Spotify is not a radio app and should not ever act like one. It downloaded fine on my Kindle Fire HD, synced up my music beautifully once logged in, and as always most of the music I could ever want. I don't mind the ads, that's what premium is for. But again, the shuffle-only issue, and it refused to sync again to accommodate the playlist changes I made online, and said 'no internet connection' even when I had WiFi and my other apps had no problem with the WiFi. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled, but this time I got a different Spotify, even though it was the same app in the store. I think it was the premium version even though I never knowingly paid. It was fantastic - but I'm worried they might have charged me, so I uninstalled. It may have been some kind if free trial, but when I first reinstalled it told me there was a payment issue in the store, so I just tried again. If they charge me, I will raise hell, but as usual Spotify is (in my experience) an amazing app."

In any case, this application is totally astonishing, waay superior to apple music which is only a more costly duplicate of spotify, spotify is free unless you need premium, however in the event that you don't have premium and you play mudic on rearrange it really gives great suggestions for melodies, for instance in case you're tuning in to lethal by britney lances since you like that tune or like me are in the phandom or something they won't play like my substance sentiment after, they will reccomend like a tune like dangerous.

I've looked for an app that allows me to play my own playlist of songs and hand pick songs I want to listen to whenever, this is that app. If you're like me and don't wanna listen to playlists based off one musician you like, Spotify is the app for you. Create your own playlist, listen to whatever you want whenever you want. If you do like listening to playlists, Spotify has that as well. If I could give it more than five stars, I would, but for now, 5 STARS! Keep up the awesomeness Spotify!"

"September 7, 2014","The best streaming music app ever. Premium is well worth it"
"October 10, 2015","I've been using spotify for a couple years, for free. Basically as soon as it was out I was using it. Just recently I was trying to pick a song to listen to( I don't listen to music often) only to be met with no song playing. I kept clicking the same song and noticed that every time I click a song the shuffle button twitches a little bit. So I then Clicked the shuffle button and voila it worked..? Not the song I wanted. It refuses To play songs I click on, it says &#34;only with spotify premium can you do this&#34;..... I've never had a problem with this and was always able to listen to any song I want when I click it. I'm really upset :( I thought spotify was one of the Best apps out there but now I feel frustrated, and something I trusted to go to, to listen, to relax, to have fun with is now going to Have to cost money..? ..well I'm not paying, your just going to have to accept my dissappointment as payment. :("

"April 28, 2015","First of all I'm nine years old just so you know. Now let's list the pros and cons, Pros: lots of wonderful music, I use it 24/7, and best of all I got a glitch that lets me do premium ! I didn't even pay for it! I do still have adds though but that's not that bad. Cons: 1. The premium cost ten dollars a month! I'm nine and I know that's expensive! 2.I know this isn't Spotify fault but Taylor Swift took her music off of Spotify and I'm one of her fans! Thank you for reading!"

"January 19, 2015","Best free radio app I have found"
"September 11, 2015","I loved Spotify before the new update but now after the company decided to tweak it a bit and update a newer version, Spotify is now horrible. You can't choose what song you want to listen to (it absolutely INSISTS on shuffle play) and then you can only flip three or four songs before you are FORCED to listen to the current song. And I mean FORCED. You can't exit out of the song and pick a new artist, nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choices you have, the user has to have premium otherwise they can't see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow going to the next song, if it's a song you don't like from the artist, then you only have two more completely random tries before you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. For me though, I just deleted the app and went searching for another music app. Sorry Spotify, you just lost a customer. :/"

"October 9, 2015","The app is a great app, my problem is how they have made this upgrade to purchase the premium package just to listen music. It hasn't been like this, and it was perfect before they made all of these exasperating changes. I do not like the fact that I cannot listen to the song I want to listen to, I hate this shuffle play because it will take albums and songs from other albums that I do not want to hear and put with the album, and it gets on my nerves. When I want to listen to &#34;Freak&#34; or &#34;Honeymoon&#34; by Lana Del Rey, I have to hear other songs of her with remixes that ruin her beautiful songs. It annoys me very much. I hope spotify gets my complaint and decides to make a change. When I want to upgrade, it doesn't me me. Soo, Spotify doesn't want me to be happy. Most of the Music apps are on Kit Kat 4.1 (Android) and iOS 7-9 (Apple) and I have a Kindle."

"August 13, 2014","So I made a spotify account and it was really great for a few minutes then I accidentally pressed the prime button and now I have a bill I can't pay for . I decided to shut down my account I go to the settings and there is nothing to shut your account down . So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through what I just went through .  Best wishes"

"September 18, 2015","With an almost surprisingly large catalogue, there is something for everyone. You can discover (or rediscover) all kinds of great music. The app runs great, I haven't had any real problems. The only problem I do have is with some of the artists pulling their music, but I can't really fault spotlight for that. The ads for the free version can get a bit annoyingly repetitive at times but it's not so bad. Personally, I find paying for the upgraded version is HIGHLY worth it, especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only is it ad free, but you can listen to music offline, which is great for things like long car trips."

There was not a clean version or radio edited version for these songs. I was very shocked with the songs I did download whom did not display an explicit tag, but once played there were curse words throughout the song. I was embarrassed & disappointed with using Spotify for the party."

"March 14, 2016","This app is basically the NEW Pandora. I recommend you to use this music app. Trust me you'll love this app, so I encourage you to switch to Spotify. It`s an incredible app, especially if you have a premium account. There`s an immense number of selections to pick from; pop, latino, rock, country and so on. Another thing you can do if your a premium user is skip songs an infinite number of times, and pick the song your heart desires to hear.There's a number of things you can do. If you're a music lover I totally recommend this app to you. Even if you're not a premium user you'll automatically fall in love with this app, you'll be blinded by your love for music. Likewise, you'll be attached to it.The only difference of not being a premium user is not having the freedom to skip songs, and make your own selection of music. Otherwise it's beyond phenomenal."

I give it 4.9 stars out of 5 for listening on kindle. And 2/5 stars on android phone. I don't know how it work on apple. But on kindle I love it."

"March 11, 2016","Great music app. I've had premium for years. One thing I don't like is that sometimes when you have a song downloaded, it will change to a different version. ie:I've had ""Walk the Line"" by Johnny Cash downloaded on a playlist for a long time, then one time when i was listening to that playlist and it played that song, it was a live version, rather than the one i had initially downloaded. This has happened a few times with other songs. They would switch to covers, instrumentals, or live versions. Other than that, I love everything about this app."

"July 22, 2015","Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since ""sold"" this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs (if I am not mistaken) that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you won't have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it's going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you don't want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have ""disposable"" playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what's the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123. I love me some Spotify!!!"

"December 5, 2014","I've tried a number of apps for music on Kindle, but in my opinion, none of them can touch Spotify. Your only inconvenience is an occasional commercial. Not bad for the trade off of being able to listen to just about any album you want. If you want the flexibility of Google Music without the $10 a month charge, check out Spotify."

"June 8, 2016","Spotify is my main source of music. It is available on every device including Roku, and has the ability to put together play lists. I used to download mp3s and it took hours of my life transferring them onto devices or cds. I had to pick one track out of entire albums constantly, and it was a pain. I am an early adopter of Spotify and the Internet in general. I remember when Yahoo Music came out. I was there for the controversial Napster, and the embracing of mp3 as a legal format to sell albums on iTunes.  Spotify could stand to give a bit more back to artists, but I love I pay a monthly fee and can support musicians just by listening as usual. I love it has a high quality play back mode and an offline mode for when you lose service. I still think it's important to purchase music, but as a culture streaming will be vital to the new model being built in the music industry.  Spotify links to last.fm accounts for charting your music, you can add local files to it, and it has great Playlist choices, recommendations from friends, stations, and more. If you're a music lover you will love this app as you have much more control over what you listen to, and is great at helping you discover new music! While supporting artists.  I highly recommend to anyone who doesn't already have Spotify. It's my daily driver, my go to, my happy place. I've been using it since it came out and I am ever grateful for it in my life. I just upgraded to a family plan so everyone can enjoy and make their own play lists.  I'd also like to add the app is smart. If you have it running at home the use it on your device it will switch to the new device seamlessly. Pretty cool right?  I think so!"

It just disappeared and then a few mins later it finally showed up as and icon on my list of apps! Also, it didn't even upload at ALL the 1st time I tried!! Hmm....Also, not thrilled I can't listen to the song my husband put on there, ""Chicken Surprise"" by Brad Price, unless I upgraded to premium?!?! Quite a scam there I am was thinking...Hmmmm....But, went with the 7 days free trial and they said no charge after, it will just revert to the original afterwards unless you're with Sprint, so we'll see...."

I only wish there wasn't so many ads (especially of the same one) so it gets hard to listen to your favorite music without having to pay premium (but I think that's the point) otherwise 5 stars."

"January 30, 2016","I LOVE IT when it WORKS. I just can't understand how they expect someone to pay for this service when it has so many malfunctions, for me anyway. For example I have to log in and out so it doesn't freeze up, and I have to turn WIFI on and off so it doesn't freeze up. This is on Multiple computers so it's not just me. Why would I pay for that especially 10 a month.  I could get Amazon prime with music/TV/movies/STORAGE/shipping for 99 a year or I could get a ""spotty"" service like Spotify for 120 a year, you be the judge."

"February 22, 2015","Whether you listen to loads of music a day, or just a song, you need Spotify. Almost every artist with every song is available on there. You start out with a playlist, My Songs, but you can make more to categorize your favorite songs. You can even follow artists that you like and get info on them, plus find out when they release more songs! I got this on my kindle so I wouldn't have to 're-purchase all the songs on my phone, and I couldn't be happier!"

"December 9, 2015","My bejeezes, this is awesome! I never listened to music beyond my single Coldplay album until this. Now I listen to a variation of music. What I love too, is it helps you find music you like, and it has most every song you can think of. It also has a bunch of different music indie, dubstep, metal, rock, rap, emo, pop, Mozart, alternative (my favorite), and more! In a nutshell, if you like music but don't want to spend your money on discs and other things like that, you'll love this. Best thing is it's free! All you need is an internet.connection."
"February 18, 2016","I love Spotify! It is the gateway to all things music. You are able to listen to all you favorites, make playlists, and brows music you would have never found without Spotify. I like to use the menu on a song to start a radio station around that song, then use the thumbs up or thumbs down to personalize the sounds I like. I love being able to download certain songs/playlist/ albums in order to use the offline mode that doesn't take any data from my limited plan. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants all your music in one place."

"October 19, 2014","Okay, I love this app. With all of my heart and soul, but there is some things that could be different. For example, when I'm trying to add a mass amount of songs to a playlist, it's very time consuming. Maybe you could add a select button so that we could select many songs at once, and then it would be easier to add to playlists. Another thing you could add, is making it so you could see how many songs you have all together, and not just in the playlists  Thanks"

With spotify you can create playlists of songs YOU want to hear! And with only a couple dollars you can listen to your music offline as well. When you first create your account you get a month of free skips and other premium features. Or join near the holidays and get a SEASON of premium music.You can browse other people's created playlists and listen to new music fast. I listen to spotify literally ALL DAY and recommend it to everyone. Definitely a five star app."

"September 9, 2015","It was perfect .... before the update.  Before: You could select whatever song you WANTED to play without having to put shuffle play and either wait for it to play or keep skipping until you get the song. (Though if you kept skipping chances are that you get an advertisement) Also, you were able to see the songs that were coming on next.  After (now): You cannot select whatever song you want to play. Which REALLY sucks. I always loved Spotify on kindle because you could pick a song. Now you can't put songs on queue or see what songs are going to play next. I always liked looking at the songs coming on next.  The update was just today. (9/9/15)   I feel so upset.  *The only thing that kept the same THANKFULLY is the ability to replay ONE song over and over again.  I want to kinda give up Spotify and just have Pandora since Spotify isn't very useful and takes up sooo much space. But I have some very good playlists.  I'm so very unhappy. I understand why they might have done that however I can't afford premium. It's not worth it. ):"
"October 1, 2014","Great"
"November 22, 2016","Some covers the artists, like nightcore, are not on there and some of the songs are not available unless you pay for premium. Lots of ads, but there are also times where you can get up to a half hour of ad free music. They don't have actual radio stations either. You can make playlists and while not all the music is available, there is a wide variety. You need a decent WiFi connection or it won't work that well. Searches are kind of irritating because you look up a song and it shows cds, artists, and songs with related or same words. It also doesn't have the option to delete/deactivate your account. Overall, it is only great if you spend money to buy premium, but is a decent source of music if you have WiFi."

"August 4, 2014","very very good"
"December 25, 2016","Spotify I feel is the best music app period. 1 being is that your not stuck having to listen to already programmed stations or set music/song lists. You can actually download full albums of literally who or whatever pops in your mind, and not just stuck to others options for music. I mean let's face it, were all different and Spotify definitely enforces that right to hear, listen, share and dance to any genre of music you or others are feeling at the moment. Another cool feature Spotify offers with having a premium account is another plan, such as the Family Plan. Yet again Spotify has personalized in so many ways to fit each person with there own individual preferences! Boom!"
"August 25, 2014","Great app!"

I did not find the interface intuitive or easy to use: Like most things on the Internet, it is easy once you know how to do it. I found that it was playing random things not even closely related to what I was selecting. I am certainly not ready to sign up for the paid subscription yet."

"July 24, 2014","I don't get i5"
"March 11, 2016","I like the app, but the three dot option button is way to close to the playlist scrollbar. So when I want to remove a song from a playlist, the app thinks I'm trying to scroll to a different place in the list. Please fix this Spotify!!!  Other than that the app is ok. I do strongly recommend that there should always be clean versions of all content instead of just some. on iTunes, the user can pick to see Clean or Explicit versions of songs. They should have this on Spotify too. Or maybe they could just have a clean versions alongside the explicit version.  Also there should be an alarm clock feature. If there already us it should be easier to find. If there is not, please add it! Thanks Spotify!"

I am amazed at how many artists and bands I have been introduced to via Spotify. I love the ""related artists"" sections provided, that let's me explore even more bands I just hope I have enough time, left here on earth, to hear it all. Also having the ability to play your music on pretty much any device you can think of is great. Keep up the good work. Worth every penny of my subscription."

"July 11, 2014","I love it"
"July 10, 2014","great app"
"November 28, 2015","I personally am not able to buy many songs, and when I do I get bored of them within a week. This app completely revolutionized listening to music for me. I can follow playlists of certain music groups to expand my library, save songs that I love, and follow artists to get notifications about new releases. One of the newer features, looking for upcoming concerts, is one of my favorites. I used to be so out of touch with who is coming where, and now I have easy access! Definitely recommend this app."
"July 10, 2014","New great"
"June 24, 2014","I love Spotify! The premium is so much better but a bit expensive. I highly recommend this as a music source for PC, Tablet and phone."
"July 14, 2014","Good app"
"July 16, 2014","Awesome"
"July 9, 2014","love ity"
"July 4, 2014","I love it"
"July 24, 2014","Good."
"December 20, 2015","This app is amazing. I mean u can get free music, make a playlist, and search for ANY song! Btw... if and when u do get the app, it might ask if u want to start a free 7 day trial to listen to songs anywhere, anytime... this trial is truly free and does goes through all 7 days. U DO need Wi-Fi for the app to work.. but when u are connected it works perfectly. I'd give this app 100 (or more) if possible anyways...all in all.... this app is amazing for anything. That's why I give this 5 stars."
"March 22, 2016","I think they could do better. They should give us a month a free music before we decide.😕 Why get something without nowing if it is worth it. It say it takes no internet and WiFi but they lied unless you pay for it. I like the songs on Spotify. They are a good website. I will not lie about that. And we should not have to sign up and you should not have to be a sertine age. That is just meen to like kids.😫 Why"
"July 8, 2014","5 STARS"
"June 12, 2017","Terrible user interface. I try to play a song on my phone, but it plays on my Alexa upstairs (apparently it plays on whatever device you last played it on). Want to clear your song queue? No can do. Have to set up a playlist with only one song, and then play that. I only switched to spotify because I got a deal with the New York Times, but, boy, do I miss Napster."
"April 6, 2017","Ease of use great library"
"September 2, 2015","Did take me a little time to figure out product. Smooth transition from Pandora. Although I enjoy both music sources I had an unlimited ""selection change / skip"" that Pandora Limits. Enjoyed the ability to select Singles from albums. Worth the Membership. Keep your Pandora for hands free listening, Try Spotify to share Music files, or creating Videos."
"March 10, 2017","I have enjoyed listening to Spotfiy music. I listen to it day and night. Everyone should listen and sing along."
"July 4, 2014","Great"
"January 26, 2016","Spotify if you're familiar with &#34;Americas top 40 hits&#34; u can keep up easily with pop songs, it's perfect for that. Also great for relaxed order of songs and if you're ok with limits to skips. I myself have grown tired of pop songs and needed more remixes and smaller songs that never find their way to the top 40. In summary, Compared to apps like rdio and Pandora it's a big one up for pop songs, but if you're after smaller artists sound cloud is the way to go."
"August 12, 2017","The app would not work on my Samsung S6 edge +.It loaded with no problem but when I tried to start it it gave me an internal error and wouldn't run. I would like to use it but can't."
"September 10, 2015","This app was probably the best music app until their new update. Before I had probably around one thousand songs and could listen to any of them in whatever order I wanted to, but because of the update you can't take shuffle, play more than one song at a time, or skip songs without buying premium. This is incredibly inconvenient, and there are some songs I simply can't play anymore. Now if you want to play a song you have to set it on shuffle, so it chooses a random song (usually not the one I want) and stays on the song until I get frustrated and try to play another song from another album. If you get this app then I would buy premium because it is a good app; it's just a crappy update."
"November 30, 2015","Well, my friend had this app for a little while on her IPhone, and she LOVED it. Sometimes she used it without wifi, and it ate up all of her data. I have a kindle, and it's either me or it makes everything else.... slow. I'm worried it'll use up my data too. Besides that, it's pretty great. So...... overall, I recommend it for extreme music lovers who only want THEIR music played. The ability to create your own playlist (for free) with any music is my kind of heaven. Thank you Spotify!"
"August 7, 2014","It works really well when u have a book and u like music and like me I like all the music that I listen too"
"April 1, 2017","Its an amazing music app but its new upgrade has made it hard for my to even add songs to my playlists! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but nothing helped! Please bring this to your attention and fix this huge bug"
"December 20, 2015","I said I s okay because at first when I got I was so happy because now I could listen to music which is my favorite thing to do so I downloaded it to my iPhone but when I clicked a song it would play another song and I found that very anoyoing and once I was going to show one of my friends a song but it played another very inappropriate song and I tryed to quickly turn it of however when I use spotifiy on my iPad it always plays the song that I want to hear it always plays that song but then there's an add for the premium and it would all of a sudden glitch now I don't know if its my only my iPhone or its spotifiy but it is so frickin annoying"
"June 25, 2016","Putting aside the whole ethical debate over artist's royalties+spotify, this app is great. Easy to use and everything comes in crystal clear; it turns my kindle into a jukebox at parties and get-togethers. It even has a great selection of some of the more obscure songs and albums that are next-to-impossible to get physical copies of. Again, judging the app, not the ""musician vs spotify"" debate. That said, definitely recommended!"
"August 20, 2016","Spotify has replaced my iTunes.  Now, some people may think that paying monthly for a music service is pointless, however, there are benefits to this service.  Not only do you get the benefits of skipping as many songs as you want, you are able to control all the music as if it were your ipod/mp3 player. The ability to search for a song you just heard on the radio and add it to your song library at that very moment is awesome. If you keep up with new music and have an extensive love for music this will be worth it.  If you're already purchasing and download more than 10+ songs a month you'll save money with this service."
"June 4, 2016","I honestly love this application so much. In my opinion, it's the best one out there. Although there are a few artists and songs that I can't find on this platform, on the whole it's easy to create playlists, follow your favorite artists, and stream music. Amazing for any music lover."
"September 14, 2015","I really like the idea, and I have a wonderful playlist of songs I like, but there is so much repetition and so many of my songs never get played. A little frustrating."
"August 5, 2016","You can find just about any song that you can imagine. Rock, rap, metal, edm, it's all here. Great loading times on the kindle. Just a few ads for non premium users, but it's more than worth it for freedom in your music. A must download for any human that likes music."
"July 22, 2016","Spotify is easy to use and works great when you do not have an FM tuner chip in your phone. I have the Samsung Galaxy S4 and of course I would own the one without the FM tuner chip so radio apps will not work I like this because I can play an artist, genre or a decade!"
"September 14, 2015","Will not let you choose what song you want to play. For a little while it will let you get addicted to it, but after that it takes those privileges away. It makes you put it on shuffle and makes you wait for the song you want to come on. Spotify will not even let you listen to just that album, it will insert &#34;suggested&#34; songs every other song. Unless you pay 10.00 a month, Spotify is not much better than Pandora. Spotify will also sometimes get stuck on an add and you will have to shut down your device to restart Spotify and continue to play music. In summary it is just as worth it to get the free version of Pandora as the free version of Spotify."
"July 24, 2015","Spotify is my favorite streaming service for music and prefer this over Pandora any day, you can listen to full albums (heck, even complete discographies if you feel so inclined to!) from all your favorite artists / bands!  If you buy the Spotify Premium Service, you're able to listen to your music - commercial free."
"November 12, 2016","I've used a lot of music apps over the years but I've never found one as great as Spotify and I loved the app so much I even upgraded to the Student Premium which is even better. And for $4.99 a month you can't beat the price or the quality."
"October 2, 2016","Best music app I have ever gotten better than I heart radio"
"October 31, 2015","I used to love Spotify so much. It was basically the best and probably one of the most used music app. Lately I noticed that there have been a lot of updates of the app. Now who wouldn't love New updates to one of their favorite app?  Now I can't skip songs more than 5 times in a row, if I want to I have to upgrade to premium. I guess a lot of people aren't upgrading to premium, so now they are making less and less features of the app available for free. Now I don't mind listening to ads, and trust me they do play along of ads back to back after listening to about 5-6 songs."
"October 5, 2017","Great hit on songs"
"December 9, 2016","I can always find music I enjoy! Thanks!"
"October 29, 2016","gives new music, albums, and singles. Love it. Hate the Mobile version though that's the only thing."
"May 21, 2016","I have been looking for a updated music app which wan't glitchy or not official. (So far) there is no better application to listen to music on. I highly recommend Spotify. It is MUCH better than other musical apps because it has all the music you could ever want. Including letting you make endless amounts of playlists (which I personally LOVE). If you are looking for a good app to play music on, then download this application."
"September 14, 2016","I used to be an avid fan of keeping recordings in my collections. I was constantly finding songs I wanted either they didn't have it available or you had to buy an entire album just to get one song. 99c to $1.29 adds up quick when you build up a collection. For this rate a month I don't need to keep all the overhead and I stream a lot. Only been twice I couldn't find something on Spotify. I wouldn't be surprised if you couldn't find it anywhere else either. They got pretty much everything ever recorded. You can stremit any tie you want and it's made more portable than carrying around CD's and ruining them or losing them."
"July 18, 2016","We were motivated to update our online library when we got our Echo, because songs from our library are available on request with the device. Unfortunately, it appears that there is no way to upload data from an audio CD (from our physical home library). It may be that there is a way to do this, but we were unable to figure out how to do so. In iTunes, it is simply a matter of inserting an audio CD while the application is running. In addition, there is evidently a 250 song limit on the number of songs you can upload into the Spotify cloud database, unless you are willing to pay ten bucks a month to upgrade the service."
"May 11, 2016","It is actually very useful for listening to music and podcasts. The thing is, although it has many songs you might not always find the song you're looking for. Yet, the format is very neat, organized, and easy to use. But, once again, there is a little problem that I have experienced. Every once and awhile, I will be listening to music, with my volume turned up and my headphones on, but there won't be any sound. It will say that the song is playing, but you can't here it. This has caused me to have to delete and redownload the app many times. Nevertheless, this is a very good app, and hopefully you won't have any glitches."
"April 3, 2016","Bc it's the best in the world you can play music off line it's awesome"
"March 7, 2016","Was a Rhapsody customer for years but the playback experience would only get worse & worse until the point of being unbearable when it wouldn't even playback my downloaded songs so I looked for a replacement & came across Spotify when introduced through Sprint and have never looked back. Far superior product, zero playback issues & they had AC/DC songs which Rhapsody did not. How do you not have one of the greatest rock bands of all time??"
"February 17, 2016","Awesome app. I like the fact that you can search by artist and get JUST that artist, instead of getting a weird mix of music and wondering how in the hell THAT song made it in there. Also, the genre specific radio stations give a wide variety of artists, in case you're wanting to just have it on while you're working or working out. Just have the free version, thinking about upgrading to the premium to see what all the hub bub's about."
"March 2, 2017","I love it❤❤"
"April 1, 2017","Love this app the best thing I ever found that's free ☺"
"December 5, 2015","My 7-day free trial ended. Once your trial ends, Spotify stinks. When you go to your playlists or radio stations they start playing random stuff! For example: I was on Ariana Grande radio and they started playing Timbaland and Nelly Furtado! You should stick with Pandora."
"November 30, 2015","I started out with this app a few months ago. It was the best one I had so far. Soon after I got it though, they updated it to where only &#34;premium subscribers&#34; could listen to any song they want without having to shuffle a playlist. I miss that version and want more for us free subscribers! I get you have to make money a somwhere, but come on! Don't tease us for a bit, then take it away. Other than that, a pretty decent app."
"August 16, 2016","Ugh there ok, I got premium for free for three months, but after a couple off weeks I would play about three songs in a row, and the song stops playing and I would constantly have to press play. I asked a friend of mine if he had experienced that problem and he had too. I know it's not my connection because of other music apps I play. Get that fixed and then I'll think about purchasing Premium."
"March 31, 2017","Perfect! So easy to personalize and navigate."
"November 5, 2015","Many times I try logging in and out tells me something like ""this email address is already linked to a Spotify account"". Right! Because it's my account, and I'm logging in, I'm not trying to set up a new account. Otherwise the app works as it should."
"February 22, 2015","I would appreciate Spotify Music more if it allowed me to use by Visa Debit card to pay for premium monthly. Can you imagine that I am willing to make a monthly payment for this service and just because I'm in the Caribbean I am restricted, and then it seems that when they noticed that I am not from any of the approved regions, I assume they figured that out after i entered my card info, i got locked out of my account all together, stupse. So I am annoyed. When they get their act together i most likely would give a higher rating....Smh, to think people bout the place pirating and I am willing to pay and here strugglin, stupse."
"January 2, 2017","Love this app because it has my favorite music. Best app ever!"
"June 18, 2014","I started using spotify on the computer and now I have it of all of my devices. I would reccomend it to anyone that loves music."
"August 13, 2016","It was wonderful then a billing error & I can not access my music, playlists, recommendations, my availability to get artist & cover art pictures. Seriously my card was stolen & I don't know the last 4 numbers of the card because I don't know which one was stolen. How do I do that if all my cards were stolen? Does this make sense to you? It doesn't make any sense to me? Explain sensai"
"November 26, 2016","It is perfect to sit down, relax, and listen to your favorite songs! You can find your friends profile or albums and follow them! You can even follow your favorite artists and their albums of to listen to!"
"November 8, 2016","This App is amazing!!! You can listen to songs make playlists and a lot more!!! What I really like is that I was listening to Spotify while writing this. So you could listen to music while doing something on your device!!!"
"May 20, 2017","It has a great selection of music. When paired with Pandora, this app is a great way to discover new artists or music. Some may complain about having to pay for more freedom in playing music. While this is a downside, one can always purchase the soundtrack from Amazon, Google or in a physical store. Or dig deep and apply for premium. 😏"
"April 1, 2017","I love Spotify. I can create my own playlists depending on my mood or what I'm doing. The ads are short and dfo not take away from the app. So much better than radio."
"March 20, 2017","This app is amazing it let's you play music while shutting off your device or playing a different app! Wow I've never had a app this good in my whole life, I'm never uninstalling hthis!!"
"June 24, 2014","I use this app a lot for playing music while I play apps such as multiplayer shooter, and scribble nauts remix."
"November 9, 2017","I love Spotify!"
"April 18, 2017","The app is overall great it lets me Pick my own music and makes Custom Playlists for the music I like! Which is pretty amazing. I've been using this app for a solid year and things have worked out really good for me.  But there's just one thing I hate to go threw..... The ads  I just hate that tormenting Man's voice that just goes ""The next 30 minutes are add free! Thanks to are following sponsors.""  I like it because I can just watch the short ad video then I can get back to enjoying my music time.  But I can't play the ad it just freezes my App and Takes forever to load (Which sucks a lot since I'm a music lover)  Sometimes if I'm LUCKY! (See I caps the word lucky) The ad might play, But other times it doesn't play at all which freakin' stinks!  Anyway I don't know if other people using this app experiences any problems like these (I just hope not)  -That one random person who's ranting on a app about ads. How pathetic"
"October 19, 2015","This app was great, we all know it.  But suddenly, out of the blue, came an update.  Because I hadn't updated the app, it was pretty glitchy. Due to that, I updated it. Now, whenever I play music and swap to another app, it crashes. The music COMPLETELY STOPS. Before the most recent update came out, it was FINE.  Because of this, I would rate it one star- but I'm not going to, because this app has great potential and on all my other devices it works quite well.  I would recommend this app, but they should really fix the bugs in the next update!!!"
"December 2, 2016","Having spent hours utilizing all the streaming music apps, websites, share site...ect - Spotify, is the best option. Finally, someone has it right. Premium option opens doors for work, play, gym and a plethora of other options. Especially, when you can download your playlists and use it offline in those dungeonesqe areas of concrete and steel. Get it. - Cheers, B"
"June 12, 2016","Best app ever I love it u can listen to the music easily and quickly and Iove how u can make ur own play list but I wish it was for free for u to listen to it out side with no wifi for free but I loveee itt !!!!"
"December 8, 2016","Love it...can listen to my music anywhere and everywhere..whether its brand new or from the 90s..!!!!"
"January 7, 2017","I am a premium member and love this app. I have several playlist and music is my life so I am always streaming my music and listening to it. I like a lot of Genres of music and this app is perfect for me, it fits my needs. I like that you can just listen to the artist unlike there competitor Pandora which only plays artist similar to the one you picked, Also I like the Offline mode when you are a Premium member, where you can download a song or album and listen to it at anytime even if you have no internet connection like on an airplane in airplane mode."
"August 30, 2016","I like the ability to create my personal playlist as well as listen to random selections. Very easy to use. I am 63 years young and still rock in. Which we had this in my school years, beats carrying cases of albums and 8 Tracks around."
"March 5, 2017","Move over Pandora and iHeart....I have found Spotify and there is no turning back."
"February 16, 2017","Amazing a lot better than Pandora"
"November 22, 2016","I love using Spotify. I play the worship music playlist to help encourage me throughout the day and to edify my faith. I also liked to play it during the lab courses I taught to make the classes go smoothly and quickly. Spotify has a huge selection of all genres of music. It is worth the monthly fee to have this selection of music at my fingertips."
"September 26, 2016","This app is awesome! I have been looking for a app that plays songs while I play games etc. Thank you so much!"
"April 29, 2017","Great stations. Great variety! LOVE this app!"
"January 9, 2015","Desktop Spotify is great: nearly every song ever at your fingertips. Mobile Spotify is a different story. 90% of the time, I use Spotify when I'm out and can't access my computer, and the shuffle play function sets my teeth on edge. It's less shuffle and more like radio, since it throws in the occasional recommended artist here and there. The idea of going ad-free, offline functionality, and unlimited skips is plenty of incentive to buy the premium version, but the shuffle feature less makes me want to go premium and more makes me want to delete the app and possibly punch something."
"July 23, 2015","OMG I love this app now I can actully listen to music while turning my tab off and has up to date songs I love that I can listen to my fav songs now thank u for making this !!!!!!! Btw u should listen to the song bellas lullaby when u get it it's a beautiful song I think u guys would like it ps. It's from twilight :p I hope this comment was helpful for u if not it's ok ps. Don't forget to listen to the song ;) thanks buh bai"
"September 15, 2015","And one point the app recognised my 7&#34; kindle as a tablet which I mean isn't it??? And I could choose a song,I still had adds bit I didn't have to just shuffle. Then one day the app updated and my kindle was recognised as a mobile device and I can only shuffle. So I just got tired of only getting recommended songs. I just use YouTube or Soundcloud even Pandora."
"February 23, 2017","I hadn't heard Barbara Mandrel in years! It's GREAT to get to hear her as much as I want now.I love the OLD country music myself.Conway.Merle etc.Thx Spotify,Your're the BEST! CAROL"
"September 4, 2016","I gave this 4 stars for one reason - There are times when I'm listening to a song and then out of the blue - it just cuts off. Why does this happen? I can be enjoying a real good song that I added to my up next listen and minutes later, it just shifts songs, without notice. Really annoying! Over all, I love spotify. Fix this problem and I'll be golden. :)"
"October 11, 2016","I have been impressed with Spotify and the choices in songs available to me! I love creating my playlist to fit my moods and activities. Sometimes I feel nostalgic and want to hear an all 80's line-up to listen and remember. But other times I just want to work out to Springsteen, Billy Joel, Elton John and too many more to list! With Spotify I can personalize my playlists any way I want. When you've got a must have song and you want it to appear several times throughout the playlist? You can make that happen with Spotify! I can even listen to my Christian music all day long and never run out of song choices. You can even listen to playlists that have already been put together if you don't want to create your own. Add songs or remove songs anytime to make a playlist truly your own! Gotta love it!"
"July 9, 2017","Great tunes, easy to use"
"September 2, 2016","My family really enjoys this app. In fact, we made it our default music app on our Echo and listen even more than befo'. Get the family subscription and !ore than 1 can listen at a time without commercials"
"December 25, 2014","Love this app. Much better than Pandora in my opinion, because you can make your own playlist, with your favorite songs. Only fault is that you have to buy a Premium if you want to be able to play certain songs when you want. You can only shuffle otherwise. You have a limited amount of skips, but more, it seems, than Pandora. They have all the songs I want. Even the most unknown to the people around me. Over all, a really fantastic app. Update: There was an update on my Kindle Fire HD, and now I can pick whatever songs I want to play whenever I want to play them."
"January 27, 2017","I love this app!!"
"December 26, 2016","This is a lit app. Works well on the Fire tablet."
"May 13, 2016","Love Spotify, I pay for the premium sub which lets you save over 3000 tracks for offline play. Commercial radio is dead - Spotify is expanding podcast support making it a great audio choice whatever your preferences."
"March 4, 2015","Something is very wrong with this app, it wants to reinstall itself everytime I open it, it's very slow at loading my music and I only have maybe a 1/20th of the amount I wanted to have, offline mode is kinda cool but still slow. And to top it all off, I made a new facebook and I had my spotify set up through my original account, so everytime I deactivated my original and opened spotify, it'd reactivate my account. But the kicker is I can't switch payment plans to another account so it's stuck on that until I get rid of spotify, which will probably be soon."
"January 30, 2017","Great app😍😍😍😍 love it"
"July 9, 2016","It's a great way of listening to music"
"January 9, 2016","We have premium, so no ads, and can play songs in any order we want. My husband, kids and teenager, and I all have our own playlists and can listen on any device, even at the same time, on the same account. We use the 'listen offline' option all the time! No internet, no problem! However, you can't set parental controls, which means the teenager has to be careful, otherwise the younger kids get explicit music showing up in their feed. I think if we paid $5 more we could have individual accounts for family members? Anyway, its a great app."
"March 3, 2015","I love Spotify. I'll say that right now. I have it on my iMac, my iPad, and on my kindle, and I don't even pay for premium. I am, however, very disappointed with the kindle spotify app. I can still make playlists and listen to radio, but I have a limited number of skips and it never plays the song I want it to. It shuffles and suggests songs constantly and also plays songs over again. What I don't understand it why I have these limitations on my kindle but not on my iPad or iMac. Is Apple so superior that I can't have the same update on my kindle??"
"January 20, 2015","At first this app worked great in my office at work for several weeks. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, it can't get through a single song without skipping or dropping the song. I tried adjusting the settings. This did not help. I also tried downloading the songs to my device. This seemed to help slightly, but songs are still skipping or failing to play. It doesn't seem to be a problem with my network as other streaming apps (I.e. Pandora) seem to be working just fine. I'm about to drop my spotlight premium subscription if this issue is not resolved"
"February 16, 2017","Wonderful app--better than Google Play or Pandora. It gives me a lot more listening options. I can select the artists or songs I want."
"June 12, 2014","This app works exactly like the desktop version and allows you to do everthing that you would with the pc version of the software. The offline function works like it should. I would remcomend this app to anybody that needs the spotify app to be abble to login to there spotify acount. I love the prenium option of being able to put music offline. It is like having an MP3 with all the music you can possibly think of. AMAZING service."
"April 1, 2017","Works as advertised"
"January 2, 2015","Well sometimes I will go on it and it never loads. What I mean by this is that I only get a gray screen . Also sometimes there are ads that I Don't mind but they pause and can't play so This means no music . Now back to that gray screen . . . I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all . If you like rock like me then listen to linkin park (in the end , numb,and no more sorrow ) you also need to listen to headstrong . These songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock ."
"April 8, 2017","I love this app it is the best apps ever it is 1 out of the 7 apps I downloaded on my Tablet but if you are not patient then sorry , every 30 minutes they give you like 2 or 3 adds no biggie. I am even listening to Paris on Spotify right now !!!😂😂😂😂😂😁😁😁😁😁"
"June 24, 2014","Love it!!! Just wish that I could afford a newer iPod so that I could listen on it. Have suggested it to a couple friends that didn't know about it."
"April 28, 2017","I love this app and it's premium. All in all its easy to use and has most songs! 😃😃"
"January 18, 2017","I love streaming music. Every album I've wanted to listen to is there. I get the premium update when I know I'll have more time for music and cancel it easily when I don't. I try all kinds of music because there's no risk. No one likes buying a disc they end up not wanting. Spotify has an excellent variety of music.  There's no need to store things. It's great for people who don't have tons of space for CD towers. I am in my mid 50's and find that this is easy to use. It's not just for millennials."
"December 26, 2016","I was really excited about this I had downloaded many stations and songs then one day I was going to listen to it while offline and ALL of my music was gone! I tried to re download the music and it said things like sorry you can't get this. I still have it but I'm really disappointed that this happened Fix it soon or I'll get rid of it and I really don't want to because I like it but if you don't fix it's gonna go :/"
"June 23, 2014","Unless you have premium, it kinda sucks because you can't listen to songs on demand; only shuffle. But rather than that, it's a great app! Easy setup,"
"January 4, 2016","You guys are idiots, why allow this app to be used without premium if youre going to make sure it doesnt work after so long without premium, the heck, I have a 3 playlists and what they cant work without premium? This is frickin stupid."
"September 22, 2016","Spotify offers a wide range of music, podcasts, and audio books. The ability to create playlists any way you want with an unlimited amount of music is cool to me. Listening to new albums from artists like, Troye Sivan, and Years and Years, is pretty neat. And the 30 seconds without ads perk is a relief after listening to radio music with numerous commercials and not enough music. The only problem with Spotify is some of the glitching I've experienced with Android tablets, other than that, Spotify is cool."
"October 14, 2014","This app is so fun.But there is one tiny catch if you are trying to fknd asong and you don't know what the title is its very hard to find. But other than that this app is off the hook. You can listen to certain songs. But you have to have an account. And that's free to and its so easy to make the a account. This app is so fun. My favorite songs is Birdwalk by soulja boy. Well that's all I'm telling you you can find out the rest when you get this app. You need to get this app. You will be doing me a huge favor."
"June 30, 2017","Spotify is amazing and a fantastic app. I love how it's integrated with other devices and I can control em all at the same time."
"June 29, 2017","Easy to use and doesn't limit music played like other similar apps"
"April 11, 2016","I love spotify. It's the best music app and I've searched high and low!"
"July 31, 2014","This is literally the only app that you can listen to any music you want for free. It's beautiful, chic and it has great sound quality.  ignore old review of this, it now allows you to listen to any of their music for completely free. You still have ads, but they're not very common. Also it's has great connection to social media and it even outlets to shazam so you can find the song you want and listen to it automatically.  Save your troubles with any other music app this is the best decision you'll ever make."
"June 10, 2014","I can't find fault with this app. It's excellent. I love music and spotify is a dream come true for music lovers. Every artist and every song I look for I find. Keep up the great work spotify"
"March 23, 2017","Spotify is amazing, except for the fact that every time I open it, it says there's no internet connection, when there CLEARLY is. Because of this, I have had to (for the past two weeks) delete the app almost daily (1-2 times) and redownload it. It frustrates me how slow it is sometimes and I am contemplating on whether I should delete Spotify for good. On the other hand, I use it every time I use my tablet (it's great to use while getting ready!) I enjoy that you can make playlists, follow them, save songs, etc. I would recommend this app to anyone who enjoys listening to music frequently, but be aware if it says there's no internet connection. I don't know if it's just my tablet or not, to be honest. ✨"
"January 14, 2017","I've found songs I thought I'd never find again. I even discovered a new favorite tune that if not for Spotify would not have. Spotify is a revolutionary development to today's music lover."
"June 14, 2014","I love my personalized mood boosting and long drive up beat playlists without commercials. Love spotify because it has shown me new artists and sounds i had forgotten about over the years. Definitely my kind of station."
"January 2, 2017","I have the free version. While the ads are super annoying, more annoying is the constant ""suggested songs""."
"February 19, 2017","Play while playing or working on your tablet etc. The beauty that is the music via Spotify is right here."
"September 15, 2015","I am in love with Spotify, but ever since there are two problems I with the new update: 1) You can no longer choose a certain song, you must always click the shuffle button and skip untill you find the song you want to hear. 2) If you are listening your own playlist, the app now adds recommended songs on there too. Honestly, I think this made the app a lot less enjoyable, and I find it annoying. I think if they want to recommend you songs, they should e-mail you them like the old way."
"September 25, 2015","The app regularity &#34;skips&#34;, similar to like what would happen if you bump a CD player. It doesn't cause the app to lock up or anything, but is annoying none the less. This happens in offline mode so it isn't caused by an unreliable network connection. This is on a fire phone."
"February 21, 2017","Ok so before I start blabbing. This App is crazy amazing. You can search all songs you want. I have to say this but this better than sound cloud SERIOUSLY. But the only down side is that You need the premium virsion. But anyway get app they did not pay me too say that."
"June 25, 2014","I was looking for good music apps and I don't really like pandora...it doesn't have enough skips and u don't know what song is going to go on. Then my brother said spotify was good. So I got the app and it has like every song I like on it!! I use this everyday!! I would rate this 10 stars if I could!"
"March 21, 2017","I got Spotify a couple years ago. I do not have Premium, (for those of you who don't know what that is, it is the version of Spotify that you pay for.) However even without Premium, Spotify is an all around amazing music app! I have never really had any trouble with it, and it plays all of my music like a breeze. I happen to have gotten Spotify when it wasn't really a big music app, and even then it worked great! It updates every now and then and makes it better pretty much every time. I would highly recommend this incredible app, especially to music lovers that just need a good music app. It has a lot of features including, following music artists, creating your own playlists, picking who you want to listen to, and you can also go to the ""Browse"" section and from there pick from a lot of genres and even sleeping sounds to help you sleep. There are radio stations to listen to as well. Great app! I would say the best ages that should get this app are, 11 and up. Depending. I love Spotify and if you get it, (which you should) then you will too! Thank you for reading this I hope I helped you make a decision on whether or not to get this amazing app."
"March 3, 2017","I love this app. Deleted IHeartRadio and several other less desirable ones after discovering this app! I love Spotify! If only I could afford the subscribtion!"
"May 3, 2016","I was reluctant to try this (ironically enough) because it's free and I figured the whole ""you get what you pay for"" adage is an adage for a reason. When Beats Music got bought out I figured I'd give Spotify a go before signing up with another subscription service. It's the best decision I've made in a long time."
"June 22, 2016","Okay so I update spotify and it says I have NO internet while I'm clearly connected to the internet. I also hate how 3/4 of the options are only for Premium. This makes me an unhappy customer, I'm not going to waste my time buying some Premium when I could easily get my favorite songs from YouTube to mp3."
"March 1, 2016","It's Spotify....nothing to complain about, assuming you aren't into one of like five obscure Italian punk rap bands they DON'T have.  No tricksy hobbitses to be found here, you just drop a $10 every month and you get unlimited access to basically every song out there to download and play whenever. Shuffle is pretty meh (it definitely doesn't cycle through your whole list like it should) but I really can't complain about the 600+ songs I've gotten for pocket change."
"October 29, 2016","Good songs best app for undertale,fnaf,artists,games songs,exedra this is just so good I can't thing of any words to say except this app is awesome,cool,and more keep it up but on phone you can only play shuffle mode could you make it so all devices don't have to do shuffle mode"
"October 12, 2016","This is a great app. The only problem I have is that it is not very self-explanatory. If you are not app savvy it is somewhat confusing. But the music selections are awesome."
"November 23, 2014","This app is great but my favorite artist was taken down, like all of her good country songs and now they only have her stupid pop songs. I need my Taylor swift back!"
"April 19, 2017","Spotify let's you listen to songs that you want to listen to! If you're a music person you need Spotify."
"September 14, 2016","Love the app and how it works, except for this device sharing, I share my account with my mom, who has her own playlist. When I'd like to listen to one song in my own playlist, and she wants to listen to a song in hers, my tablet will play the same song she's playing on her separate iphone se, and vice versa, I can't listen to anything without it playing on her phone, I don't like it. I've tried to turn it off but nothing seems to work, please fix this."
"April 6, 2017","Pros -  Lots of music Family account lets me play simultaneously from different devices  Cons -  The download feature is a joke, I regularly have issues with playing downloaded songs even though I am actually connected to internet. If it was really downloaded then it shouldn't have to ping spotify servers to play it..."
"May 9, 2017","I dance to my music now"
"June 17, 2014","It's amazing to listen to any song from any artist. I don't have premium and that's not a problem I can listen to the songs I downloaded on my Kindle when I don't have internet. All and all spotify provides something I just cannot find with Pandora.  GOOD JOB SPOTIFY"
"November 28, 2016","I used to have pretty bad sleep insomnia but this app solved my problem the The doctor recommended a sound box for goin to sleep but I made a jazz Playlist and this app was a gold medalist in my Olympics this app is also the King of the music jungle"
"December 11, 2016","This app is awesome!! You can pick any song you want to listen too. You can listen to new hits or the 50's. One thing is, the songs that have curse words in them say it and they don't block it out, so I wouldn't pick songs that have curse words in it. Good luck!"
"October 2, 2015","Can only play shuffled. Can't just listen to an album from beginning to end. Ads are way too loud. Much louder than the music. I find myself ripping out my ear phones when an ad starts even though the music itself wasn't very loud."
"April 27, 2017","Great the best"
"July 23, 2014","GREAT if you don't mind NOT choosing your own songs even ones you own. I find it annoying that you can't play a specific song unless you have a one song playlist and even then you get the crummy suggestion.  I like Pandora better personally. I can at least listen to the one song I want to hear or someone else hear without issue. Spotify on the pc is the way to go.  $10 a month premium is just too much would rather watch movies for that kind of money."
"November 22, 2015","This app is annoying. It constantly pauses itself meaning you have to unlock your device and physically open the app and start it again. It doesn't continuously play even after hitting the loop button meaning it'll play a song and leave a 5-10 minute break in it. And the advertisements are aggressive to the point of insanity. That being said it's the only app of its kind that allows you to select your songs from all songs so I guess it's a necessary evil."
"May 17, 2016","This app is cool! I got the free trial for spotify premium but it ended. How do I upgrade it to premium?!?! PLEASE HELP! IM NOT ENJOYING IT AS WELL!!!"
"October 1, 2016","Love Love LOVE THIS APP !!! All the had music you. Could  ask for ... As a music Lover the greatest music app I've ever tried! I would definitely recommend this app for all music lovers and enjoyers! Thank you so much Spotify, your the music God savior yo!"
"December 19, 2016","You can skip anytime on the tablet version"
"January 29, 2017","Spotify has been great and very reliable!!!"
"June 27, 2017","This app finds the best music"
"October 2, 2017","I can't count how many times I've listened to Hamilton on this, it has a little of everything and has playlists t For what ever you may be doing, studying d wrong or even Podcats, after you find st a playlist of a track the app automatically plays a song related to the track you just listened to. This helps you discover new songs and artists you might like, they you would have never found othwise."
"March 6, 2017","I can find almost anything here with ease and nice programming design"
"August 4, 2016","Really good music Even takes away ads for 30 min😂 I think its cool"
"April 3, 2016","Very nice app, I love it."
"January 16, 2017","I've always thought Pandora was a bit stupid, playing music similar to yours instead of the music you like, and soundcloud just didn't have a good selection. Spotify has an enormous selection, minimal ads, and high quality audio, and that's just the base app, you can get premium and have unlimited skips, no ads, and even higher quality music, not that you really need higher quality. Overall one of my favourite apps."
"December 10, 2016","I just love the app. I have installed it on my iPad and my BlackBerry as well as on my laptop. It works well on all three. There is always something new to listen to when I am feeling like something different. I have discovered many new artists that otherwise would have remained unknowned to me and bought their songs afterward. Works with or without wifi or internet connection and can be shared. I am really impressed!"
"September 17, 2014","I loooove this app. All the music I want , and can create my own playlist too!!....man!!!....I'm in music Heaven"
"March 17, 2017","I can't even express how much I love this app. I've tried iheartradio, the Windows music thing, iTunes, and this, and Spotify is the best out of all of them. I had been using the Windows music thingy (I forget what it's called lol) but I needed an app for my kindle that does the same thing-- Spotify is that app, only its better than what I was using. You don't have to download the music-- it's all there in Spotify's massive library of songs, albums, artists, and more. You can create playlists, listen to songs, save music, and much more. Only on some occasions do you ever search for a song and see its not there-- about 98% of songs you search for are there.  I found out about Spotify because my friend recommended it to me and at first I was a little skeptical because you have to sign up for it, but everything (even the deluxe albums) are still FREE. My dad asked me if it was legal because everything is free and yes, Spotify is 100% legit and legal-- they get there money from 30 second ads about every 15 songs or so.  The only small error I ever encountered was sometimes it takes a minute to load, but that's probably just my old kindle. This app is also compatible with every single device I've ever used. Overall, I love this app and I hope you get it because it took me a long time to type this"
"March 23, 2016","I deleted it by mistake and downloaded it again but I could not sign back i n because I had forgotten my password. It did not give me an option to change my password . I could not make a new a count because it said my email was already taken. I would not rament this app for two reasons: One if youndelete it you never get it back Two they don't have popular artists thet kids now a days love DO NOT GET THIS APP"
"June 22, 2017","Specific song by Johnny Guitar Watson not in library of his works. I do like that you can download specific songs as opposed to entire album or having to create a station."
"June 13, 2017","Still learning how to navigate but I am sure it will be better when I learn the ins and outs."
"November 21, 2016","I find the variety of music offered by Spodify to be phenomenal. Such a wide variety of music. The cost for a prime subscription is so reasonable. I thoroughly enjoy searching for music I love and listening to it through this app. FIW of ATL"
"December 26, 2016","This app does not letme listen to music the way I want to, unless I spend money."
"April 2, 2016","Most helpful app"
"August 16, 2017","Great free music or may pay for specific type of music W/O commercials."
"February 3, 2016","Not only is the premium service only worth the money if I'm using it on mobile but the free version is so irritating it basically forces you to upgrade. While it's perfectly reasonable for ads to play when using a free service I noted two things recently after years of using it: 1) an average of three adds ran in between each song - a rate that even Pandora never uses and 2) ads ran when I played my own local files."
"August 19, 2017","Great music and I enjoy every minute"
"October 7, 2017","Love Love it...Every song I have requested has always been available...Thanks for providing us with the best music app out there!!"
"February 7, 2017","This app is like a best friend that is always there for you. The music encourages me, comforts me, opens my eyes, cheers me up, makes me happy and more! I just love the music so much! There is ALWAYS more to listen to. And you get to listen to what you like and want when you want to! It is amazing and totally FREE if you don't get premium. Which you already have the full package without premium!"
"September 11, 2015","I am officially a hooked on Spotify listener/ user. I love the variations in stations, weather it be in genres or moods, Spotify has it ALL! I particularly like the Discovery Weekly playlist which stays in tuned with what you like listening to, keeps you up to speed with fresh music and a lil hint of older hits.  Definitely recommend Spotify to others to experience, listen and enjoy its splendor! 😉🙌😁🎶🎵📻🎧"
"May 18, 2017","It's amazing"
"June 19, 2014","Spotify was a good music app when it first appeared but has grown better and better! The clincher for me was the ability to download my favorite songs and playlist to my various platforms, phone, tablet, ereader, computer and iTouch. Wireless or phone data signal is not always available and knowing that I can still listen to the music that I want is very important to me. Way to go Spotify, keep up the great work!"
"June 29, 2017","It is such a great APP"
"November 3, 2015","I have been using this on my phone and Kindle. At first, I loved it. Much better than Pandora. But streaming now sucks. I have a perfect internet connection, and it does the same thing on other Wi-Fi and on mobile networks. It stops randomly saying that there is no internet connection. All the time. I've looked it up, called support, and nothing fixes it. If it gets fixed, I'll give it five stars. A shame, really."
"June 18, 2017","It's pretty good. I wish I would have signed up for premium when it first came out."
"June 27, 2017","Omg this is the best app a talking about no adds love this app"
"July 24, 2014","Every time I use my kindle I always want to play music but when you go to the music store it cost a lot off money but now I all my favorite songs and they get new artists every week now I can listen to music and enjoy any time I want"
"September 14, 2017","Been with Spotify for a couple of years now, it great!! Can't do with out my music. Get what you want, when you want it! What could be better than that??"
"May 10, 2017","I am in love with this app the best app in the world for music just you have to downpour it and try it out.😀. #The best"
"October 8, 2017","Very nice. I particularly appreciate the largely accurate suggestions."
"August 28, 2016","It's A Great And Wonderfully Helpful App, But I Wish It Had Way More Songs. Like, The Gypsy Bard? The One About Pinkie Pie??? Please Add It. I NEED YOU TOO💔!!! And If/When You Add The Song I Will Rate You Five Stars😃! Also, Please Make It So That I Can Mute A YouTube Video And Listen To Music With It! Like With The Speedpaint Videos I Like To Watch! Sorry For The Long Review, Toodles!"
"October 15, 2016","Best Great Amassing Awsome Created Successful Cool Dearly Good Goodness."
"November 29, 2016","I love this app it's like..the best it's better then Pandora! Like if your on tablet and computer you get to choose free songs and you can pay for the premium. I recommend this for music lovers! Thank you Spotify!!"
"January 15, 2016","I love Spotify! I am currently taking advantage of the .99 3 month trial. The benefits are wonderful. No commercials and no data usage. It's not worth the higher monthly fee to me once the trial expires so at that point I will be cancelling premium and going back to the free version. It doesn't use a ton of data and I can deal with the commercials to have the ability to choose my favorite music!"
"November 23, 2016","Runs great, love how on my tablet I can pick my music and not have to keep it on shuffle like I have to do on my phone. Also customer service was great when I needed help with app one time great app."
"July 16, 2014","Atkinson's account of (presumably) his own spiritual search and awakening experience lends us a first-hand perspective, with which I at least could identify.  It presents universal truths in an understandable way, and drives home the message that ""this could be need me, too"".  Though a bit antiquated, I enjoyed his style and setting and found it entertaining as well as enlightening."
"November 19, 2016","This app is great and I have it on all my devices that are compatible"
"October 27, 2016","90% of the music I listen to is found on spotify. So it's worth the $5."
"July 27, 2016","I like it but the songs skip during playback...EVERY TIME!!! It doesn't seem to matter what device I'm using, wired or wireless. At times, it makes me hesitant to use when I also have Amazon Prime competing for my attention."
"June 28, 2017","It has all my music and more!!"
"April 26, 2017","Great application!"
"April 5, 2017","IT'S AMAZING IT HAS EVERYRHING!!!!!!!! :3"
"February 14, 2017","Always can find and play any song quickly and easily!!"
"June 26, 2017","This is great 👍"
"June 21, 2016","Love this app. I do not pay for music anymore. You can create playlist. Listen to them on shuffle. You occasionally hear a commercial. But it is free music. Sometimes you can watch an ad and get a half hour of commercial free music. Awesome app."
"October 6, 2017","NOTHING REALLY DIFFERENT FROMANY OTHER MUSIC STATION!"
"March 31, 2017","Cool Spotify"
"February 19, 2017","Wonderful quality for free"
"May 11, 2017","But I hate the ads"
"May 8, 2017","Ever since I got it, I can't get enough. I use it to work out, I use it for my daughter to fall asleep. I use it for my son."
"December 30, 2016","Yes you can find pretty much any song on Spotify, but the best part of it is the playlist selection they have, especially the ones based on songs you already listen to."
"September 12, 2015","I loved spotify until they got their new update. Now it'd similar to pandora and you can't choose what song , you can't listen to a specific song, and there is no longer a queue so you can't know what song your going to listen to. I hate the new update, now you only can use those things if you purchase the premium :( spotlight is a good app but now it's just not as good."
"June 8, 2017","Had this for my tv, getting it for my tablet again!"
"April 13, 2017","On any other device, I would probably give this a 5/5, but there are certain bugs on the Kindle that desperately need fixing. For one, Spotify has a tendency to crash randomly for no apparent reason. Secondly, typically when I open up the app, it acts as if there's no internet conncection (Home page, browse page, search bar, and Recently Listened all fail to load), even when connected to WiFi. I can still access my playlists and saved albums (because despite what it says, it is actually connected) but whenever I try to access the kenu for a tracks it says ""No internet connection"". However, despite all of this, the app is far from unusable. Usually after the app crashes and you go back into it, it works fine, and a lot of the time stuff will eventually load as you're using the app. I just wish it was more consistently reliable."
"July 2, 2014","At first I saw my cousin have it then I wanted it and forgot it. I did not know what it was called I did not ask my cousin for the name I got the name bye her saying to her mom spotify is great and when I went to find out what the name was by looking for a music app and I am happy now."
"October 6, 2015","The app is not opening on Samsung S5."
"December 19, 2016","This is the best music app that I have every used faithful user since 2003"

"January 4, 2017","Retired baby boomer with huge music collection. Spotify gives me easy access to hear the artists I like and helps me discover new talent. Like Lorene Scafaria. And Sturgill Simpson."
"September 30, 2016","I love Spotify! The only thing I wish they would change is making the ads more personalized so there is no chance of seeing offensive ads while enjoying the musical experience"
"May 6, 2017","Such a good music app! I love it!!!"
"November 17, 2015","I have been using this app for almost a year, and I loved it. Now though the stupid thing will not let me chose a song unless I pay for it what the hell I am not dealing with this it I wanted a limited number of skips and to not be able to chose the song I would have use I heart radio or Pandora. This is soo not my favourite app anymore, back to youtube it is."
"December 7, 2016","Great free music and podcasts. Spotify does have a no add premium option for a monthly cost but I don't mind the ads for free music I can choose. Huge variety, categories and specialized mood/activity lists. Good way to keep up on the new and upcoming artists. Also fun to check out unexplored genres and podcasts. Overall great service!"
"June 29, 2017","You have to pay to go ad-free,but the adds don't show up too often! 💙💜💙💜"
"October 11, 2016","Everything in one app from Metal to ambience!"
"November 20, 2016","Sure, I wish Spotify was less expensive or totally free! Who doesn't?! Although it stops playing and I can't figure out why. Sometimes, it won't allow my ""play next/que"" to work properly! And that makes me very sad!  The monthly charge needs to be cheaper! Play next should Always be free!"
"December 15, 2016","The best music library of any service. Music discovery is very robust, either by searching popular songs by artists or by the Spotify curated playlists."
"November 19, 2016","THIS IS THE BEST"
"September 23, 2015","Ever since the new update it has disabled you to turn off shuffle. It it gives you ads that are more consistent than before. The app restricts your ability of listening to your music when you want and what you want to play. Overall it has given more ads limited the amounts of skips and only allows you to shuffle play which may play songs that don't fit your mood."
"July 23, 2016","I love Spotify! Spotify premium is totally worth it. The only problem I am having is that the app tends to act up. I'll skip a song, and the next song will play but the first song will still be shown in the notification bar. When I click on the song to get to the app, Spotify doesnt respond and I have to close it. It's so frustrating."
"October 29, 2016","It used to be great but it's getting more and more restricted. The app won't let you connect to external speakers without paying which seems unfair. I'd rather just use Pandora."
"April 1, 2017","I like this music player beacuse it has so many songs and even some videos ypou can surck your favorite songs in and make a play list I like it so much."
"June 27, 2016","Way better than Pandora or any other music app I've tried, its also way cheaper than using iTunes since you don't have to pay for the songs you add. I love the fact that you can make your playlists how you want and if you have premium you can play any song you want whenever you want and play songs in whatever order you want all the time."
"June 25, 2014","THIS APP IS AMAZING... I have this also for my computer and Ipod.. The one part I hate about it on my kindle fire is that you cannot pick what song you want to listen to it is just a shuffle play unless you want to pay. You get a certain amount of skips and I didn't know that so I just wasted all of them thinking I had unlimited."
"June 27, 2014","great app!!!! i loved it but it suddenly started saying that i cant listen to my already downloaded music until i got premium and it wont let me get premium"
"July 8, 2015","Love listening to my Christian music on this app."
"June 29, 2014","An amazing music experience, and great to see it on the Amazon Appstore. Love it on my Intel Atom Android tablet, be sure to enable highest quality audio streaming in settings."
"February 7, 2017","Spotify is an awesome app it is always working and I just can't stop listening to the music!!!!"
"September 27, 2017","did not work for me"
"March 27, 2016","With the title, I say that when I first downloaded this, I thought it would work but it just says 'Spotify isn't responding, close tab?' And it keeps on happening whenever I try to log in. Please fix it, Thank You =)"
"February 20, 2017","Great! They give what i WANT to hear when I'm working and NOT what irritates me."
"March 19, 2017","i enjoy spitify @ the gym working out.!"
"June 24, 2014","Spotify is easy to use for searching and listening to music. I love making different playlists from the oldies music to the present. Thanks for making it to use for a tablet."
"September 17, 2014","You can look music up by band name and create a station just for you. It also has recommendations. I listen to Spotify every day. Thanks for a terrific music app."
"September 13, 2014","So far all I ever get Is rap,,hip hop,,and such garbage,,!! I found one selection,The Rolling Stones,,after cruising through a mass of garbage,, Evidently,,being an older musician,I am very critical of the garbage that now seems to be popular,!! I rarely use it ,,however the option of selecting a Complete Album to listen to,,without paying is applaudable,!! I give it 4 stars,!! The only competition I find to compare it with Is ,,,Pandora!!,a great Web Site,,great choices,,New and Old,!!"
"December 19, 2016","best app ever"
"February 3, 2017","I love Spotify. ALL the music is free. I just love it! 💘"
"January 12, 2016","I love this app, especially the premium. Way better than other music apps in my opinion. I had to go a couple months without premium and it seemed as bad as listening to Pandora, but the premium is definitely worth the $9.99 a month in my opinion. Definitely one app I rather not go without."
"November 15, 2015","It was amazing in till they updated it now you don't get to pick what song you listen to......it's stupid and sucks.....if I had a chance I would change it back to the old version"
"October 29, 2016","Has all the songs that I wanted. The best since Napster. I would have have it five stars but I had to pay extra for family plan. I know it is just business"
"April 29, 2017","Hard to use"
"September 14, 2014","I absolutely loooooovvvvvveeeee this app, it gives you a free trial and everything. And after your trial is over you can still listen to music for free"
"September 16, 2014","I likes this one real good. It is better than the YouTube for straight music listening. One does not need to sift through 'covers' or sound quality and the tracks are delineated with shuffling, queuing, communities, following and such. Basic one is free, or a monthly fee version with more features that are worth the expense, is the upgrade."
"December 10, 2016","Good choice"
"April 21, 2017","best ten bucks i ever spento"
"October 22, 2016","I LOVE THIS APP!!!"

"August 4, 2016","Perfect for college students."
"September 16, 2014","I love spotify I get the music I want except they need to let people do the upgrade for free and let it be easy but just pushing the upgrade button"
"June 8, 2015","Waste of money if you have Amazon Prime! It's far inferior."
"October 7, 2017","I heard its a great app; it wouldn't allow me to down load so I had to delete it"
"December 8, 2016","I love Spotify. Have Amazon Prime, had Groove subscription, have Google play. Love Spotify the most. Easy, quick ready tunes everywhere I go."
"June 26, 2014","Have been using Spotify for almost 2 Years, it's been GREAT. It's up to date with the current music, has every song that you could think of. GREAT PRODUCT."
"September 13, 2014","I like Spotify, it's amazing you can listen to all type of music. And the best it's free and a 30 seconds commercial. I like that very much."
"July 6, 2016","This music app is fantastic"

"March 21, 2016","Love being able to choose my own playlist and the exact songs!!"
"September 23, 2014","I freaking love this app. I love music and it is a music lovers dream come true. The only thing that stinks is the shuffle. On thepc version you can pick Iif you want to shuffle or not and the android version yoi have no choice. Besides that it is an excellent app and I am keeping it my phone until I upgrade :)"
"September 16, 2014","I absolutely love this app. I have it on Amazon Kindle and Samsung Galaxy S4 Active. Absolutely the best music app I've found yet!"
"July 30, 2016","The app is great because the concept of music streaming is great. The only thing I wish the app did is something the PC does- see what friends are listening to. If the app had a page for keeping up with friends and seeing their current listening, I'd easily consider this a 5 star app."
"June 21, 2016","Honestly,it's too early for me to conclude anything about Spotify music except that I definitely don't like the commercials. I'm already paying for Pandora One, and their price seems more reasonable. I'm going to give this one a while longer at this time. Maybe I will change my mind."
"May 12, 2016","Perfect selection of music"
"June 22, 2014","This app works the same as the one you can put on your laptop with the added bonus of not making everything else slow down while you use it"
"June 19, 2014","I love this app it's amazing and I can't go anywhere without it. Definitely going to keep this and I don't have to use any other music app."
"May 12, 2016","I use this all the time"
"March 25, 2017","Discover has been severely downgraded in the new version and it makes it really hard to find other artists or albums similar to the ones you like. I hate this app now"
"September 27, 2017","Loving it. Very easy to use."
"February 22, 2017","Do I like Spotify?  I love it so much!!!! You can get premium and go out of internet service. You should get Spotify and get premium so you can go out of the reach of the internet service and go add free. Play any song at any time and any were. You should definitely get Spotify with premium!!! LOVE IT👍🙌💟👍!!!!"
"June 6, 2017","U should get thus app its amazing But that's my opinion u should get it for yourself and find out"
"March 18, 2017","I love love love this app!!!! It let's me listen to my music all the time!! Amazing app"

"February 8, 2017","Love listening to music on my kindle and laptop. Highly recommen to everyone."
"June 27, 2014","The new layout is excellent, but works slow on a Blackberry Q10. And I am really missing the option of purchasing songs."
"June 29, 2014","This is a great ideia, you can listen all your music without concern to lose álbuns or not have this album close to you"
"June 9, 2017","Specify is awesome to have, making your own playlists, listening to other people's playlists that they've made, and just relaxing to the beat 🎵🎶🎼🎵"
"June 20, 2014","Nice app. Easy to use. I like being able to pick an artist and listen to music from just that artist unlike other apps."
"June 21, 2014","Love this app. Very easy to use, can choose what I like to listen and do it off line. It's great I do recommend it."
"June 25, 2017","Best app on my phone"
"September 15, 2016","IT WONT LET ME DOWNOAD. Even though the app is awesome but it wont let me download the premium version at all its like ""UPGRADE AVAILABLE NOW YOU CAN GET PREMIUM FOR FREE!"" but wont let me dowload the premium version. 3 outa 5"
"October 9, 2017","The app is easy to use. I wish it was easier to find the non-explicit versions of songs."

"March 13, 2015","Ill try to make a playlist offline but I need premium and it doesn't show how to get it"
"February 11, 2017","Awesome music app"
"July 3, 2017","I love this app but the thing is it would be better if we did not need to have internet connection to use our playlists that we already have made so I give this app 3 stars"
"June 20, 2014","It's very nice but I really miss MOG. I like Amazon Music on my laptop but was unable to convert the Amazon Cloud App on my older Android phone. Maybe soon. I've also enjoyed Pandora for years. Life would be diminished without music."
"June 17, 2014","I love this app. I can pick and choose any kind of music I want as well as make my own play lists etc."
"April 4, 2017","This app is very helpful for mW to listen to music I highly recall it"
"October 24, 2016","Good all around app with a good selection of music. I recommend it to all my friends."
"January 11, 2017","Couldn't locate an artist which I could on Pandora. Songs after awhile wouldn't play. Kept stopping after I hit the play button. Never had this problem with Pandora. Uninstalled the Spotify icon and went back to Pandora."
"November 2, 2016","I like how you don't have to watch videos, and the music doesn't take forever to load."
"June 7, 2016","Super"
"October 16, 2016","Great music app. Enjoying it enough to consider upgrading to the subscription plan."
"December 31, 2015","I opened the app and it first froze my entire kindle fire second restarted my fire and third made my fire remove all the apps on my SD card and this was the only app that did this too none of the other apps crashed not even one only Spotify"
"January 22, 2016","just okay"
"October 4, 2016","Would be even better if you can hear song that you already downloaded without WiFi."
"January 26, 2016","When I got it, it was a easy going until they don't tell u the side note it is $5 a Mon. what a rip off. And I had trouble downloading it and playing music. Wow I had a hard time. It took me 5 hours to download it.... this is terable :.-("
"February 7, 2017","Awesome get it you will not regret it"
"October 9, 2017","awsome"
"October 14, 2016","This shuts down my new Apple desktop, for some reason! It always has! And it probably always will...It's probably because you're trying to install malware on my system!!! And my system is like coughing like a 100 year old man, & passes out* Since it freezes FIRST, before shutting down. I noticed this after an update too...Hmmm...So YES, you read that right folks! They are currently embroiled in a malware scandal! So far it only effects desktop computers. So I don't use it on my computer anymore. Only on my smartphone which is lagged so bad, that any playlist (online or off) has ever loaded up. It tries to load up the last song I played, & always gives me an error message. Instead I just hit ""Home"" before the load completes that gives me an error message. By interrupting it & selecting home, I can get to my playlist. Hate this drama. PS. Why are you taking away my favorite songs again?! Is it because you're also reported to NOT pay the artists' as much as their lawyers would want?! Yea, I read that about you recently as well!"
"June 4, 2017","Love, love Spotify. Premium is a bit pricey at $10/month. Maybe they should consider a hybrid premium. Keep the ads but give premium access for $5/month."
"September 19, 2015","The new update sucks because you need premium to shut off shuffle and I think it's complete bullcrap"
"July 7, 2016","Works fine"
"January 1, 2015","Today this app started to screw up. I can login and everything, but when I got to my music it won't load and kicks me out of the app. Very disappointed."
"January 5, 2015","They force you to listen to many garbage songs of their choice"
"September 28, 2016","I think it is a great app so I give. A fivebstar rating but it won't let me listen to music if I don't have WiFi and I don't have a phone so I don't have WiFi everywhere."
"April 7, 2015","what a pain but good music selection"
"October 1, 2016","Had Spotify many weeks before using. Why did I wait so long, great listening!"
"March 24, 2015","Installed this a week back from amazon store. Have tried to creat an account number of times, both with facebook or with my email. Not able to log in."
"November 28, 2016","Love Spotify! Its easy to find songs."
"August 18, 2015","So this app gets a one star because it had me change my password several times and each time won't allow me to sign in and use the app. It seems that it doesn't want people to use the app? Maybe fix this problem and I will fix the review."
"September 21, 2016","I live it got family premium $12 for 6 people. Good sound. Good music. LOVE it"
"December 13, 2014","Once you download this thing it wants you to create an account with either Facebook or your e-mail address to be able to use it, so don't buy it. It's just a waste of time. God, I want my old music app back, but I have no idea what it was called."
"May 6, 2016","I was charged for it last week and dont even have it on my phone anymore. I would give 0 stars"
"September 5, 2015","I used this app for years and i absolutely loved it but now sadly it has stopped working it works fine on laptop and my ipad but on my kindle it has stopped working. The songs will not play, i dont know if its me? Anyway im disappointed."
"October 5, 2017","Every time!"
"September 25, 2015","difficult to load and impossible to use on my phone."
"April 18, 2017","This let's you listen to music without internet/WiFi"
"April 4, 2017","Needs less ads"
"July 10, 2015","Now let me just say if you're getting this application for your blackberry classic oh my god have I had the worst experience that I have ever had with an app. Don't get me wrong I'm pretty sure that it's my phone that makes it so slow and choppy and unsteady but this app sucks on blackberry classics. It works better on Passports. The experience I've had with this app is choppiness. Lag. freezes. crashes. unresponsiveness. It's just the worse. Spotify you guys have to make an application especially for Blackberries. Put it up on the BB world. Please. This sucks. And I'm a premium user for this s***? F that."
"October 25, 2014","Doesn't play the song selected. Uninstall this one."
"September 3, 2016","😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😊😊😊😂😂😂😂😂😄😄😄😄☺😀😀😀☺☺☺☺☺☺"
"November 25, 2016","The new favorite on my kindle. It literally good 🎶music. I have no complaints. Wish Prince were on it though. But I'm hearing music I've never heard before. Broadening my musical tastes and horizons. 😁😁😁"
"April 16, 2016","Best music streaming app if you're on premium. Worst app imaginable if you're on free subscription and a music lover who loves to listen to specific songs and artists. Someone like me. Even the most basic thing like choosing your own music isn't permitted, even on a limited basis. Not recommended if you aren't ready to spend $10/mo to go premium, which I find quite expensive, hence not an option for me at the moment. 1 star because there's no commamdable middle ground here, planned in a way to force users to go premium or stop using spotify altogether. 😔"
"January 5, 2015","Well this app started out working fine but now when ever I try and open it it automatically closes me out so I can't use the app any more."
"July 15, 2016","Love me some Spotify! Great niche playlists!😉"
"February 27, 2016","Keeps going offline (the issue isn't on my end). The ads don't always show up for the 30 minutes of free music causing the inability to play anything else. If it's this crappy for freebies I'm not paying for premium."
"October 25, 2016","I really like has all of my songs! Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!"
"February 4, 2017","Great app for listening to music. My only (small) complaint is that you can't always find the song you're looking for."
"June 14, 2014","Convenient, entertaining, and relaxing! I recommend this to all music lovers.Try the free apps and start enjoying all your favorite music instantly."
"June 23, 2016","Love it! Such a variety of music.!"
"March 9, 2017","lots of issues"
"August 6, 2016","Spotify lets you choose what songs you want to listen to. You get to create your playlists and aren't forced to listen to songs you don't like over and over again, like some other Radio Apps. The search engine is easy to use, and finding the artists you love, as well as obscure artists is a snap. I love this App and use it on my phone, computer (desktop), Kindle, laptop, and I even pipe it through the surround sound speakers via TV and PS4."
"April 19, 2016","I'll never buy another CD!! Get your favorite artists' new hits as soon as they're released! LOVE SPOTIFY... it has EVERYTHING. Now FREE on mobile on mobile and tablets too. Hurry.... You're wasting time!!!"
"April 26, 2016","Wasn't really impressed due to the fact that you could only use this app with Wi-Fi or data. Was really looking for something that I could use without using all of my data plan. I also didn't like the fact that to get the really good stuff you had to sign up for a subscription."

"October 22, 2016","It won't let me update......"
"March 11, 2017","I love this app.I really don't know how I would get all my music needs without it"
"January 1, 2015","I totally used to love it. I like it more than Pandora because if you make your own playlist you could have unlimited skips and choose your music. But now whenever I go to my music it exits our and I have to delete the app."
"July 15, 2017","Free,if you download the song/album you can listen to the music without WiFi, which I love if I have to go with my family to McDonalds or some sort of resteraunt to eat ,or anywhere in general and want to listen to a song"
"October 12, 2014","Have to oh to save music sucks wow only a7 day trail unreal dont waste your money download play tube you can save tracks free on that"

"April 2, 2017","Love this app! Such a great way to discover new music. I just wish there was an easy way to put parental controls for kids."
"September 10, 2015","At first, I loved this app, but now you have to have premium membership to pick the song you want... that's stupid, they shouldn't have done that. You can't skip songs, you have to listen to what they pick. Now it's like Pandora. The reason why I switched to this app was because you could pick the music you wanted to listen to, skip as many songs as you want. But now they've taken that away. Thanks Spotify 😈"
"May 9, 2017","Premium is a great service. I don't even buy music anymore and can listen to whatever I want. Highly recommend"
"December 7, 2014","I was dissapointed with the quality of the music when played on my laptop with Bose speakers. BTW, it is not the sound card."

"May 8, 2017","It's free music, can you really complain?"
"July 29, 2015","I feel like I am stealing music from the artists, and it sucks the wonder out of listening to new music."

"November 23, 2015","It's just recently I noticed that spotify can't play music. It just keeps on refreshing but can't open and play music files. I tried changing isp but still can't open and use app. Pls fix. Thank you."

"June 29, 2016","Love the selection and that music is available offline as well as online. I use it to create playlists for my yoga and barre classes."
"July 25, 2015","Not really. If you want to listen to more than three songs, or scroll through it, you gotta upgrade."
"December 26, 2014","I can't sign up using my email, which force me into register using my facebook account. Then, when I tried to log in, it just said that &#34;this email is registered&#34;, and nothing else happen..."
"March 30, 2016","Love it, works great! No issues at all. 10/10 would recomend ."
"October 10, 2015","Great app to start with. Nice tease then after 6 months you have to pay to have &#34;premium membership&#34; to listen to your own music. Going back to my i-Pod this app is NOT free!!!!!"
"February 20, 2017","It's like you own the songs, but it's FREE. I also enjoy looking at other playlists and stations with my favorite artist's songs."
"September 26, 2014","If you have amazon prime this product is a waste of time. They don't tell you it's only a gimmick to charge you later."
"September 19, 2015","I had reinstalled it and it wouldn't let me take it off shuffle or let me change the song when before it did. It makes me mad because I constantly have to hit shuffle. It's really annoying......"
"February 20, 2015","Cannot log in"
"February 11, 2017","This app let's you like sten to any artist you want it defiantly deserves five stars"

"June 14, 2016","its different than i heart. im still working my way around it. not quite a fan yet not a hater. the music is different than i heart. same artists. different songs. i like that."
"August 18, 2014","I'm in love with this app. Spodify let's you look up the album or song you want to listen to or you can just pick a playlist that is already made. I advise anyone who is thinking about the app to get it."
"September 9, 2015","I used to be able to play songs in whatever order whenever I wanted, but now Spotify is trying to force me to get Premium. Thanks to this new update, I may just undownload the app. Thanks a lot!"
"February 3, 2017","Great app. It has all the music I could possibly want. Well worth paying a little extra to get the premium stuff"
"October 8, 2015","Hate the new update. If I wanted Pandora, I would've downloaded it. I want to listen to my music when I want. I don't want &#34;free shuffling&#34; thank you very much. Uninstalling."
"August 23, 2014","I love the app, but it's not opening on the kindle fire. it wont download!!! please help if this has happened to you!"
"December 11, 2016","It is very easy to find your favourite songs"

"August 24, 2015","Will not let me sign up for a new account or sign in with my existing Facebook profile. Tried reinstalling, clearing data and cache, and reading forums on the Spotify page with no resolutions"
"February 28, 2015","Terrible! Free version is just junk. How do I uninstall this from my Fire? The music constantly shuffles so a song you want to listen to changes to a song similar. Seriously, how do I uninstall?"
"June 13, 2014","Excellent product. All musics available. Easy to use and nice graphic. I reccomend spotify to all. Grat job. Thanks. bye"
"October 2, 2016","I really love it and I get to search and download and play my music,it rocks and kicks ass,I can listen to my favorites all everyday non-stop"
"June 14, 2014","Works most of the time. Pretty clear sound when it is working. Nice to have on the tablet so I'm not glued to the PC."
"December 12, 2016","worst program ever. could not download any song, would only 'play shuffle' on albums. not user friendly. why would anyone want such a controlled and inopperative app."
"June 9, 2015","Spotify has no taylor swift songs with taylor swift actually singing them, all it has is karaoke"
"September 20, 2015","THIS APP MAKES YOU PAY TEN DOLLARS JUST TO TURN OFF SHUFFLE, AND YES I DID CHECK TO SEE IF IT REALLY DID HAPPEN THAT WAY AND IT DID, SPOTIFY IM VERY VERY VERY VERY DISAPOINTED IN YOU!!!!!!"

"August 4, 2015","Couldn't get it to work on my devices. Windows phone and kindle fire HD.8.9"""
"May 12, 2015","I don't need it!"
"September 17, 2015","didn't like it"
"September 14, 2015","I am a free user and now this stupid update made it so you can only use the shuffle button instead of picking the song u want unless u get the premium. This app sucks for free users. 😈"
"November 21, 2015","it does not work right it always crashes"
"January 10, 2015","always comes up with the error message... will try again in a few days and if nothing...I'll be switching back to Pandora"
"October 30, 2016","I was going to give this app 5stars but suddenly I can't play anything unless I upgrade to the premium package...WTH. . so I'm giving this app 1star until I can."

"May 30, 2015","Don't know how to use it"
"November 30, 2014","I hate this because of my kindle update I can't play any ducking music and the only this that works is Netflix so if my ducking kindle worked maybe I would be able to give this a higher rate"
"May 3, 2016","It said it was a free download. I thought that the music was free. You explained that the music cost money. So I think that it is a lie to say "",free"" download"
"January 2, 2015","Listen everyone. There are ads, and you have to EARN your right to skip songs. Although it lets you listen for free without downloading anything, this app is, and I QUOTE from my little sister, &#34;This game is stupid and crappy. I wish we had the other app!!&#34; See? She hates this app, I do to, and so does my boyfriend and parents. You SHOULD NOT get this game. I am warning you."
"March 19, 2015","I hate this app! The new version won't even let me play my own playlist😬 this sucks and I'm never going to go on it again. I would rate it zero stars but it won't let me so I'll rate it 1."
"June 7, 2017","Can not sign in"
"July 11, 2015","This app it's missing very basic profile handling features. It only allows integration with Facebook. It should allow full profile management and integration with other social networks."
"December 16, 2015","Upon my last update for this application, I have been unable to open the application and receive a message titled, internal error, and I would very much le to access my spotify."

"April 19, 2016","Can't get into my account and they are billing me"
"April 2, 2016","I was not a big fan. it was not easy for me to use."
"December 29, 2014","Ok I got it yesterday and it worked great but now it keeps kicking me off when I try to use it"
"June 27, 2017","I love it cause there's offline music also it has a bunch of music that only gamers would like heh..like fan made games.and it has that so yeah! Different from other apps but a good difference! 😸"
"January 10, 2016","If you don't have email you can't use the app. I don't, and it sucks. Soundcloud and all other music apps I know (other than YouTube) use a email address. I THINK THAT SUCKS."
"July 2, 2014","Nice to pick all the songs that YOU want. Plus, making playlists make things easier for you to listen songs."
"September 22, 2016","Tried to make me create an account etc. I lost interest in about 15 seconds and went to google play. Sorry Spotify WAY too complicated. Get workin on that ASAP!"
"January 14, 2015","It tells me I need to upgrade but I don't know how!!!!"
"April 10, 2017","Horribe, I got this for background but whenever I play game the music cuts. Don't waste your time with this. Just get Pandora"
"March 31, 2016","It doesn't let me have the it because I'm 10"
"October 24, 2015","I used to love this, it was one of my favorite apps! Until it said it was 'Updated'. Is the update only being able to shuffle, and not being able to just tap on a song and play it?! If it is, then that's a stupid update. Or, it may be an update for other devices, but not Kindle Fires. I hope you can fix it, but until then I'm not playing it."
"April 20, 2016","I was denied access to Spotify because of my age."
"December 15, 2016","I love Spotify because I can choose the songs that I love and want to listen too! I love this app and totally recommend this app if you want listen just to the songs you love. (Ad free music you need to get premium)"
"March 16, 2015","Spotify has no customer service. This really sucks. Months ago I needed to close my account for $ reasons and had no help from Spotify doing it. The next month, they billed me. I got really mad because I was under the impression I had done all that was needed to close my account. The second time around I found I had to go through 3 steps to close it. They do not tell you this. If I am going to have service with a company I expect it to have customer service. Period."
"March 5, 2017","Spotify has the best music varieties that I can choose from and its a good app!😀💗Love it!!"
"April 23, 2016","I can't even get the app to open. I tried on my Samsung Galaxy Exhilarate, my Galaxy S2 and my Kindle Fire and every time I try to sign up with Facebook or sign up with email it says ""We are experiencing problems, please try again later"" and that's happened every time I uninstall and reinstall and on every device. I'd love to listen to music while cleaning or cooking or something but until this issue is fixed,I'll have to find a different free music app."
"September 9, 2015","I hate the new update. On my kindle I would be able to choose the song I wanted to listen to without premium. Could you please change it back not everyone has money for premium"
"December 24, 2015","There isent my favorite song king tut by busta rhymes available for me and it pisses me off,spotify you need to upgrade and get more songs,like all songs from the artists"
"June 28, 2014","I love it,when I find one hundred percent of my music I will give it five stars, but so far I love it."
"March 4, 2015","It never plays anything I like and if I pick a band it just plays that band for years and I can only skip the songs I dislike 6 time so I'm stuck listening to crap for another hour"
"February 7, 2016","Could not open. Kept telling me I had the wrong email."
"August 19, 2016","Have no idea how to use this."
"October 1, 2014","It Stinks. Does not respond to prompts and cannot create any type of portfolio. Perhaps if there were a proper tutorial. Meanwhile, I hate thta it is taking up space on my Kindle."
"April 13, 2017","I love this app its a lot better than Pandora less adds and you can make a playlist of songs you like never listening to one's you don't ."
"July 28, 2015","I can't Download it even though I am pressing the download button"
"November 26, 2015","Was working great with the exception of the ads But now you must purchase Premium to select the specific song you wanna which is completely unfair and unnecessary"
"September 24, 2015","Of course its free !!!!!! Because it doesn't work ."
"October 17, 2014","You have to use a device to stream it to this app. Well duh. Why don't I just stream it from my device directly instead? Useless app. Embarrassing release from Spotifiy."
"August 4, 2016","Very similar to the desktop app. Only occasional crashes. Easy to use.  Spotify service is fantastic! Try it free! I was using the ""p"" service and it was ok. But with Spotify I can make my own lists, as well as listen to radio. Then I got premium! Love this! No going back! I can find 90 to 95% of what I want. And with the Discover Weekly playlist I get 30 recommendations a week for my highly eclectic tastes. Loving it!  This was not a paid review!"
"August 25, 2016","I'm sick and tired of all these adds. Can you just be normal and let people listen to the music they want and not all the adds? They're so annoying too"
"December 19, 2016","Don't use"
"November 6, 2014","My friend Mackenzie recommend this to me and I love it! Good luck!!!!"
"October 5, 2014","I downloaded this app and as soon as i was done i lost all my music that was in my clouds."
"May 30, 2016","I was looking for one of my favorite tupac songs of all time and all I saw was the censured versions and I know I already saved the song and it wasn't there"
"April 3, 2015","following installation it failed to start."
"September 11, 2015","I was really enjoying Spotify until it had a new update, Now if you was to listen to a certain song you can't. You have to hit shuffle until it plays the song you want."
"April 7, 2015","Annoying to use."
"June 25, 2017","I enjoy using Spotify I rate it a 5 star haven't had any trouble with it so far!😆"
"September 11, 2015","I used to love this app but now it stinks because you can't do ANYTHING. I am probably going to delete it soon. You won't make any money like this. Spotify you FAILED."
"September 9, 2015","I used spotify because I liked that I could choose whatever song I was feeling. But with the new update, I would have to pay for the same thing. I'm done with spotify."
"April 25, 2016","Sucked couldn't get the song I wanted"
"February 17, 2016","Can't login , even using Facebook account!"
"May 2, 2016","Won't open. Force closes every time."
"February 21, 2016","This app tends to play one song and that's it. It's kind of like waiting for me to kick start it after each song. Annoying, it takes the joy out of listening."
"September 10, 2015","Spotify was doing great until there latest update on 9/10/15 they completely wrecked it for all the people who don't have premium. I demand pure old version back!!!!"
"May 13, 2015","This has been validating for like two hours now, had to delete it. Very disappointing."
"March 15, 2017","The BEST music app I've used, by far. The only one I use for music now. Music is my life, no TV, it keeps me going, if it was an option I'd give 10 stars. Great job & thank you for allowing me to enjoy my music with this app."
"May 24, 2016","Pandora is way easier to use."
"February 19, 2016","This app wont open on my kindle. It works on my other devices and installed on the kindle it just wont open. If it was workable i would give it high reviews."
"May 30, 2015","I liked how it started out, and was leaning towards it becoming my favorite. But with Pandora, and the fact I am a Amazon Prime customer, I just couldn't bring myself to pay $10 a month for the bonus feature - which even the basic features are needed."
"March 25, 2016","It's okay, but there are enough other apps out there that do the same thing and I like the interface of some of the other ones better. Maybe it's a familiarity thing - I got used to other apps before trying this one...I went back to the other ones."
"August 1, 2016","Downloaded app. After about a few hours started receiving pop ups asking me to subscript for a monthly fee, I thought this was a free station???"
"September 20, 2014","I love spotify, but this app just stopped working for no apparent reason. I merely get a blank screen when the app is opened. If you can fix this, I'll give it five stars."
"November 10, 2017","I love Spotify!! Very good quality and good songs!! Very easy to use!!!"
"October 30, 2015","Stopped working after last update. Completely!"
"December 25, 2014","I haven't been able to get into Spotify as yet."
"July 2, 2014","I love it is amazing. It introduces me to music I never knew about and its great on the go."
"October 3, 2016","The app is great, especially Discover Weekly. I just I could download individual songs in the track options that open when you tap the 3 dots."
"December 26, 2016","It's already been deleted. The confusion comes from not know whether you're using something you're paying for, if you've signed up for something or not, offers for extra songs, can I download music or not. After a couple of days of dealing with it, I uninstalled it and went with Amazon Prime music simple, straight forward. If I want access to more than 2 million songs I can pay for that privilege through a simple, straight forward offer."
"September 13, 2015","Unable to logon with my Kindle Fire. No problem when using PC but my password is not recognized on Kindle. It won't let me change password using Kindle. Gtrrrrr."
"June 20, 2015","Pretty lame so far,,,"
"June 5, 2015","No comment upset"
"July 30, 2015","I just would not work I kept getting redirected and saying try again. It got 1 star because I could not post with out a star rating otherwise it'd get ZERO stars"
"May 12, 2017","Spotify keeps saying experiencing problems try again later. If anyone could help contact me at millerboys2010@gmail.com."
"November 15, 2016","Sorry"
"May 16, 2016","I'm two weeks into the free test drive of the premium website. The only reason I became interested in Spotify was that I bought an Amazon Echo. Although I have a Prime membership with Amazon, I found a lot of music I grew up with in the 60's wasn't available through Amazon Prime, but it was through Spotify. (Of course, for what amounts to $120 per year for Spotify, I could probably buy a boatload of music on Amazon that's not available on Prime.) Plus, Spotify has a lot of compilations of different kinds of music I like. From reviews I read before uploading Spotify, it seemed like they were the premier site for a broad range of digital music, and that seems to be true."
"September 28, 2014","This app is a RADIO app you don't get to choose the music you want to listen too it's hard to use and hard to understand plus the music buffers and it won't load right."
"May 12, 2016","I like it very much"
"May 12, 2016","The music was great"
"June 13, 2014","I love it I can turn it on any time of the day to enjoy the best of music it's fantastic"
"January 18, 2015","Before I could listen offline and without shuffle but I can't anymore"
"November 1, 2015","It is not free for my tablet anymore why is that"
"September 22, 2014","Just didn't like how it forces you to listen to what they want you to listen to."
"June 8, 2017","Can't get anything as it only offers me Facebook and I do not use Facebook."
"August 25, 2014","It seemed to target the younger group. Pandora has many more choices for all ages"
"December 17, 2015","Doesn't work on my 2nd gen Kindle."
"April 12, 2015","IRS what I want to hear, not what you want me to hear"

"June 23, 2015","It's cool but you have to pay for it...why should I'm pay when I have youtube for free?!"
"July 9, 2016","I don't like it anyone more I can't skip a song without it being premium I'm not going to Pyongyang just so I can skip or even play a song"
"September 23, 2016","Awesome reading. Amazing all the impacts Christianity has made in our world. Great read and information for our skeptical friends."
"April 17, 2015","Always tells me I'm off line when I know I'm not."
"July 10, 2017","I've had Spotify for awhile now and it's easily one of the best apps I own!! I recommend it to everyone because the app has MANY different song choices and podcasts also, it's easy and simply to use. I love Spotify, I use it every day, and I couldn't imagine life without this app!!!!"
"December 15, 2014","Didn't care for it and uninstalled it"
"September 13, 2015","I thought you can play any song at anytime on tablet for free? It only allows shuffle on my kindle after the recent update. Is there a way to fix this?"
"March 26, 2015","Spotify sucks. Get Pandora."
"July 18, 2015","I could never get it to register me as a customer. The registration attempts ended in failure on at least four occasions. I gave up and deleted the app."
"December 14, 2014","I could not open this stupid thing and I could not delete it now it's just stuck there on my device and my cloud I wish I could give it negative stars :(((((("
"May 15, 2017","It's a good app for listening to music but the downside is that you have to pay pick what song you want to listen to. If you don't pay for premium your music is played on shuffle. Over all this is a good app"
"March 3, 2016","i never purchased this."
"April 21, 2016","Skips while playing"
"October 18, 2015","A wonderful at first then... SUCKS"
"November 21, 2015","Avoid has ridiculous limit. Doesn't ""allow"" you to download enough to make worthwhile. Really sucks. Wish there were lower than one star."
"May 12, 2016","Great app"
"September 16, 2015","I used to love spotify. But then I got the stupid update and now it sucks. Never down load this app. You can't play the songs you want. IT SUCKS!!!"

"December 28, 2014","Went to many Christmas listed, and they were not there. Maybe it will be better after Christmas season is overwith and not looking for Seasonal songs."
"November 24, 2015","Won't work outside the US of A! Just like prime video. Bs"
"January 19, 2015","The app for tablets is supposed to let you choose your song. But through the kindle app store it acts like the mobile app and only allows shuffle play."
"November 11, 2016","I did not order this item. then I will get a charge one month later. People keep a close eye on your credit card charges!!"
"April 1, 2017","Very cool and enjoyable"
"May 1, 2015","I have this app on my android tablet but it doesn't make me have to listen to suggested songs!! It LETS me choose ANY song and a couple adds here and here. But this app is horrible compared to the one on my android tablet!!!"

"March 8, 2017","I love Spotify and use it all of the time. The ads were fine at first, but I feel like they have gotten longer and more frequent."
"October 11, 2015","I doesn't work anymore for me someone help me!"

"December 7, 2015","Doesnt let me use my premium service, really slow to load songs, tells me I am offline always even though my interent connection is fine."

"September 12, 2015","No longer works on my kindle fire HDX. Kept prompting me to change my password and then have me login again only to tell me my password is incorrect and the ""form"" has expired? Also cannot play individual songs anymore. Really disappointed, I used this app everyday."
"July 29, 2015","It was a good app up until Shuffel only play was introduced so unless you're a member you have to hope to get lucky with the shuffle button."
"February 19, 2017","All the things you love about Pandora but listen to what you want when you want when you subscribe! Even share and create playlists with/for your friends. Or perhaps a mixtape throwback for a loved one!"

"August 30, 2015","Uninstalled immediately after first commercial. Okay for head bangers, rockers, rappers and the like. Good music. Easy interface. Commercials need to be more in line with the type of music streaming. There is no way I'm opting for a service that blasts a screaming voice in my ear after listening to a Bach cantata. I like commercial breaks. Spotify seems to believe where commercials are concerned, one size fits all."

"September 1, 2014","""Spotify"" is the best music app ever! ""Pandora,"" is finally beaten. Spotify is awesome you can listen to any song, at anytime (well if you use the premium type, you can listen to music at anytime.) The problem is I wish I can buy the premium type, but you can get for a 1 week trial, I loved it. So buy this app you won't regret it."
"October 15, 2015","I can't play my music because of premium Agree with that"
"February 2, 2017","The best app ever I also love that you can play games while listening to your favorite music"

"March 26, 2015","I found what I needed"
"September 25, 2015","Free version became simply junk. Only shuffle allowed and 3 forwards by session. So it is time to say goodbye app."
"October 1, 2014","The free version would be better if I didn't have to listen to everything on shuffle. Unless there is a way to turn it off?"
"May 11, 2016","I checked Classic Rock and then selected groups like The Rolling Stones, The Doors and Led Zeppelin. The first song played was Do-Ray-Me by Julie Andrews. The second song I didn't even recognise the artist or song. I thought I could just kick back and enjoy some tunes, but noooo. I may give it another chance but the initial launch was a fail."
"April 3, 2016","I listen to music for hours (10+) every day from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep at night. I have a rather large and unwieldy music collection ranging from hundreds of vinyl albums to cassette mix tapes (remember those?) to CDs to untold mp3s. SPOTIFY is a place I can almost always count on to have all my music collection queued and ready to play anywhere I'm online. Then, there's all the music I've yet to discover, old and new. Even listening all the time is not enough to even scratch the surface on new releases. I am frugal, but 9.99 a month is well worth it to me. I love Spotify."
"June 25, 2017","I can control what I am listening to on my Kindle with my iPhone. Pretty cool but not a big deal. I love spotify regardless....nice to see what devices are available when you look at settings."
"October 19, 2014","Works great. I use Spotify mobile app on W8 phone & Kindle Fire. No issues. I heard some reviews complain abut the shuffle play being only play back option. The Spotify app does make it appear the only playback option is Shuffle Play as button is prominent on top play list, but to bypass just click on first song to start playing music and the songs will continue to play in descending order as your playlist is built. Enjoy. Now for the Amazon Fire HD music app - go back to school or at least try and mimic Spotify if you want to have any success."
"December 9, 2014","This App sucks.I have uninstalled ire and reinstalled several times, but it still doesn't work."
"September 19, 2015","Before the update you could play any music you wanted. Now you have to get premium and listen to which song you want and when you want I suggest getting SoundCloud. My daughter was devastated because she has to pay to listen to music that she wants."

"December 29, 2015","Useless. Never let me login"
"July 8, 2015","Are they serious? So they make Spotify free to the 'free' users. Give it for wht's been a month or so I think, and then.... take it away - so we can only play radio or albums on Shuffle.  We cannot now just play a track - like we could when they first made it free?!?!  That's pretty poor and very &#34;teasing&#34;."

"September 9, 2015","So an a phone, you had to play music on shuffle if u didn't have premium. On a tablet or laptop, you could play whichever song want. With the new terms and conditions update, you cannot play a certain song, you have to use shuffle play. The only reason I used this app was because I could listen to a specific song without paying for it. Now I'm deleting this app because I have no further use for it."
"May 13, 2016","BEST APP EVER!!!!!!! GET NOW!!!!!!!! ALL THE MUSIC I HAV EVER WANTED FOR FREE!"
"October 12, 2016","I enjoy Spotify overall, but I believe there is room for improvements."
"August 27, 2014","$9.95 a month does not justify the lack of songs that this thing has. Granted that with Sprint, depending on your plan, you can get this free for six months. It was okay if you live in NA, SA, and EU. It does not have enought JPop and KPop to have me pay $9.95 a month. Pandora is much cheaper and has what I like to listen to."

"January 5, 2015","I am using a payed Spotify service for several years now, making playlists and collecting my 'own music'. When BlackBerry Q10 arrived they stopped supporting this platform, but I managed to find a client that still did the job verry well. Since this week I was forced to move to the latest version in the app store here (old version was 'not supported anymore'). Now my BlackBerry passport crashes all the time, offline mode can't be activated anymore and I need to login everytime I start up Spotify + battery drains... Ones you are addicted they take advantage of you. Make your own playlists with your own music in the device's native client and realize the control you lose when these cloudbased solutions are out of the 'yes we have another customer mode!' and leave you in the dark without access to what feels like your music collection!"

"August 18, 2016","States that it does not download to Kindle, because it's a Google app."
"July 1, 2016","A very nice system I'm glad that I changed to Spotify from Pandora Radio"
"November 9, 2015","While I do like that Spotify, unlike Pandora, plays what you actually search for right off the bat, I chose to stick with Pandora as it allows you to filter out explicit content. True, Spotify will play edited albums if you search for them, but there's no telling what else will start playing in that station. I used up all of my skips and still got stuck with a song that swore a lot (that was just on an Angels & Airwaves station. They rarely swear but I was playing an edited album just to be safe). If Pandora's license allows them to give users the option to filter explicit content, surely Spotify should be able to as well."
"July 11, 2016","Never worked properly for me. I uninstalled it. Perhaps I'll try again."

"April 25, 2015","Keeps playing the same songs over and over."
"November 22, 2015","The business model of Spotify is to hurt your ears with increased volume and pitched commercials without any compassion. Commercials are specifically designed to annoy you into giving them money, &#34;or else&#34;. 3rd party commercials are repetitive and cringingly corny.  You might say &#34;Hey, they're a business trying to make money.&#34;. I would respond that, they have shown a lack of integrity or self respect, and undeserving of paid subscription fees."

"February 20, 2016","Horrible thing ever"
"October 8, 2015","I've had spotify on my kindle for the almost three years, and its been great to me the whole time: I could find just about any song I wanted, queue up my own playlist in the order I want, and listen to individual songs at my leisure. It must have happened just today because I still had all these freedoms when I was listening to my music last night, but the most recent update is upsetting, to say the least. This once wondrous app which once gave me free access to a complete library all in the order I wanted, is now as crappy as the mobile app for phones. I really loved this app before then, it was the quickest and easiest way to listen to music how I wanted, but now I can only shuffle my playlists. NOTHING ELSE. To the creators of this app, I don't think you fully realize how absolutely frustrating it is when you want nothing more than to listen to certain songs, but because of the recent update on the app you have to pray that you can find the right song in the limited number of skips the app gives you, and when you don't, you feel an empty depression form in your chest. I know the quick and easy way to solve this would be to buy spotify premium, but guess what?? Not everyone can afford to spend $24 a month+ just for music!!!! :D SO glad to see that this app is now more concerned with getting rich than the value of sharing wonderful music with everyone! I'll definitely be looking for other apps now that offer the same wide library but free access to order the songs as you wish. This app WAS great, but overnight I'm assuming some corporate bum took over and decided to rob half the world of music. Good on you, bub. :')"
"October 29, 2015","You can no longer choose what you want,I hope it isn't permanent because I use it to workout. It's supposed to free on demand on PC and Tablets at minimum 7&#34;. We need an update,NOW!!!"
"March 2, 2017","This is te best music app!"
"May 16, 2017","This is better than Pandora because you can choose which song you'd like to hear. I highly recommend this app."
"June 3, 2016","lousy selection. I'll probably never listen to it."
"November 1, 2015","It's such a shame that it only allows shuffle play."
"September 10, 2015","The new update really killed this app! Please fix it!"
"December 27, 2014","Spotify is the best app hands down!!!! Wish it was around decades ago!"
"June 7, 2016","I tied to pay for premium but it would not let me"
"June 16, 2017","No good cancel my account"
"March 18, 2016","Before I updated this app months ago, it was pretty good. You could listen to the songs you wanted to! But when I did update it, it made me listen to the songs it wanted to, AND I had a daily skip limit. I like iheart radio better. To be honest, I would give this 0 stars if I could. I wish I had never updated it."
"September 18, 2016","They don't have the type of music I listen to."

"July 16, 2016","Crashes CONSTANTLY. Very frustrating update"
"December 21, 2014","How do u get premium? I've tried to download but nothing"
"September 22, 2016","Your search for a great app for music has ended! Spotify has thousands of songs to choose from. Two drawbacks is that if u have the kindle fire HD6, you won't have to web player option, that lets you choose whatever music you want just with ads. Then for the downgraded devices, you don't have web player.I just make playlists of just one song so I can listen to whatever I want though, so it's no issue for me at all. Besides that, this app is great for all the people who need to listen to music ln a daily basis. On VERY rare occasion does it crash btw."
"October 9, 2015","This app sucks!!! I do not recommend this app!"
"July 24, 2016","too many ads and too expensive to buy pro"

"February 14, 2017","I am so happy to have all the music I grew up with, any genre, you look for a song and you find it. Simple to use. I love, love, love this app and so will you."

"February 9, 2017","Disappointed in choices"
"January 31, 2017","Didn't have information"
"September 10, 2015","Spotify changing the you can choose to shuffle only honestly hurts Amazon and them. This is going to get out to people thinking of buying a kindle and once they hear about the spotify changes and if they use spotify religiously this is going to discourage them and that is going to mean way less sales of kindle`s and is going to make them choose a different device so good job Amazon for letting this happen."

But eveytime I try to add a song to a playlist or push the ""Go to Album/Artist"" it just taps out of that option and doesn't do anything and its quite annoying.

"June 27, 2016","I listen to many online music providers, Spotify is just one. I've not had an instance where Spotify didn't have an artist I wanted to listen to or a genre to fit my mood at that moment. I'm very pleased."

"September 19, 2015","Wow I made the mistake of updating. So many regrets. Before the update I could pick the songs I wanted to listen to and add things to my queue without needing to pay for premium. This app used to be 5 stars. Now I have to pay to do anything other than shuffle a playlist... This is absolutely disappointing. Wish I could turn back time and not update because this app is pretty much useless to me now."

"September 26, 2014","This is not my tastes"
"May 2, 2016","AWESOME"
"March 10, 2016","I had this app on my kindle for over 2-yrs. then it stops working and Amazon can't even help me. They say it's the developer. The notice during the download says it's not compatible to the Kindle device, makes no sense at all. Now trying to download to my android phone for at least a week and no luck. I would like to have a music selection without having to load up from my computer every dang cd I have. sucks!"
"May 14, 2016","Great"
"July 9, 2017","Its great you can save and listen to your music and stuff but when I hit the little botton that says download cause I wanna download the songs it says,that it can't and my songs don't download, if you just want to listen to music this is perfect for you,but if you wanna download them then its not"
"January 31, 2016","Don't like it"
"April 12, 2017","I love the app, but with recent updates (as of 4/11/17) there have been several bugs ranging from being unable to add songs to playlists, and now whenever i try to open it, takes me to the appstore to update, i update it, open it again, tells me to update again, and it goes on and on."
"May 2, 2016","Nice"

"September 26, 2015","Uhhhhhh =( I'm so mad because my sister deleted it and I'm trying to sign back up it won't let me the tried to log in but I don't remember my username or password so one star spotify fix it please and you get a 5star rating please please please spotify is the best but I can't hear any music because I'm not logged in or singed up because I can't remember I'm trying to re sight up but it won't let me so please fix it !!!=/"
"August 24, 2014","Well I did like the app because of the 7 day trial but afterwards it didn't tell me how to get premium. I searched every part I could of the app and still could find no information on how to get premium. I use my kindle fire for this but I don't think that's the problem. I tried un-installing it and restalling it because it wouldn't fully get an update. It kept saying it couldn't finish installing. So I tried re-installing it only to see that it still couldn't fully get installed. Ive spent days trying to set this up and make it work only to see that I wasted my time. This app is a waste of time so don't install it... its completely worthless."
"January 1, 2015","Good music app"
"October 27, 2014","I hate this app because though it has a lot of music, it doesn't allow for more than a few skips of disliked songs AND if I don't have enough songs on a playlist like more than five or six, it forcefully adds MORE from other artists it THINKS are similar onto MY playlist. NOPE! I DELETED it and replaced it with Tunein and IHeartRadio, which are much MORE user friendly in MY opinion."
"November 20, 2014","Sad."
"August 10, 2014","Can't skip songs."
"June 7, 2015","I am very disappointed I thought that I could possibly find something better than Pandora but I was wrong. So for the first few hours Spotify worked, then as I am trying listen to my favorite song it won't play and it will pause on it's own. What's bazzare is that I have a lot of Falling in Reverse and it won't play one single song by the band, but it will work fine on any other song. So basically don't buy the app if you reading this review."
"October 29, 2014","NEED TO CANCEL"
"May 7, 2015","Unless you pay the premium subscription, this app is nothing but terrible, the same commercial five times in a row every ten minutes, they say they give you 30 minutes ad free if you watch these long videos, but then they force you to listen to whatever garbage they want in order to continue listening to what you want. I only got it because the ps4 got it, but this is horrible."
"February 12, 2015","You can't pick any of the songs you want making this pos worthless."
"July 7, 2017","You could play any music that you want to hear 😀😍😋"
"May 23, 2017","Not for me personally. Amazon Music is much better."
"February 13, 2017","I love it because it has my favorite songs of all time!!!"

"February 4, 2017","I LOVE SPOTIFY BC I GET TO PICK MY OWN MUSIC"
"March 1, 2015","I don't appreciate the sneaky ads and unsolicited emails."
"August 30, 2014","I love Spotify. I don't love the mobile app very much. Now I understand that a mobile version of the website is going to necessarily be less flexible than the site. I get that. But why I'm limited to shuffle play, I don't understand. Surely that's not a huge memory issue?  Here's the thing, I'm a writer.. I put together playlists for each piece I work on and listen to them as I write. I take a lot of time deciding what the right flow is on my playlists, and hearing them shuffled kind of defeats the whole process. Yeah, I find it irritating and it's pretty much put paid to the idea of using Spotify on my phone or tablet unless I'm just going to do some random listening."
"June 4, 2017","Look up :post Malone deluxe"

"July 6, 2017","Such a great app!!! I can listen to music anytime and I can listen to all my favorite songs. The only thing is I wish you can listen to it without Wi-Fi but it's still amazing!"
"June 21, 2016","I like spotify however I don't like how every option is blocked due to not having premium. I have suggestion that around certain holidays where spotify can be cheaper and have some months free. For example the the months for 99¢. I believe that this will ensure more customers and keep some coming back."
"June 29, 2016","It gives me a bunch of artist that I love and know! Please like if you really like this app.😊"
"June 25, 2014","Still learning my way around the site. Great to get the chance to listen to a wide range of music from other countries and broaden the ethnic mix I can appreciate.Brilliant."
"September 13, 2014","At first I liked this app because you could crate your own playlist of your favorite songs but once you delete it you can't get it back. It won't let you install."
"May 14, 2017","Great app, a lot of songs, easy to find and so easy to use. I love this app. Only one thing bothering me is it's often stop working after using it for five and maybe. And it often happens every single time I use it. I use this app on my fire 8 hd though. It would be great if this problem will be fixed for me me"
"November 12, 2015","Garbage. The first thing it did is do away with all my album art. Well, it didn't delete the art because it's part of the MP3 files via a tag editor but for some stupid reason it displayed the art once and then blanks the next time I opened it. My guess is it was going to download its own version of the album and artist art. Phooey on THAT"
"February 2, 2017","Great for music lovers!!"
"February 12, 2017","The only problem I have with this app is that Ill get an as saying that if I watch a video then I'll get 30 minutes of as free music, two Songs later I'm getting ads"
"June 22, 2014","This app is very slow and should be more fluid. UI is not clear too. And I don't understand why mobile spotify plays music in mixed mode, compare to desktop version."
"September 10, 2015","When I first got this app, it was a dream come true, being able to listen to any song whenever I wanted to (if I had WiFi) and the variety of the radio stations. But a few days ago, the app updated and I have no say in what I listen to unless you have premium and I'm forced to shuffle play but after 5 skips you can't skip anymore. Please fix this and convert back the original version of Spotify where you have the freedom to choose what you listen to and whenever you want to listen to it. Thank you for reading my review and I hope this helped you choose if you want the app or not."
"January 13, 2017","Great until lyrics disappeared, then for months they have strung people along, telling them they're going to fix it. They now use an outside source. You may have to pay extra for the lyrics; I don't know. Seemed like a hassle. I quit them mostly for the way they kept saying it would soon be better than ever. Bull. Felt played, myself."
"October 26, 2016","Spotify is the nest thing ever. They have almost all artists and music. I would recommend it to anyone☺☺"
"October 26, 2017","Amazing play lists. So many different genres. Finding something different every time I sign in."
"June 6, 2016","(Yes I intentionally spelled it that way) Its pretty awesome ads are not that often maybe once every 10 songs and they are either 15 or 30 seconds long. Sound quality is amazing! My only wish is I can play music without premium, so when I dont have access (wifi is needed if you dont have premium) I just use my mp3 player when I dont have wifi. Otherwise its awesome I have had playlist with over 300 songs so defiantly a lot of song space in a playlist. You can even watch the late night show with jimmy fallon so win win over all great app defiantly get it if your looking for music. Sorry for rambling on!"
"July 19, 2015","Cannot load on my Kindle"
"November 11, 2014","Whenever I'm playing music it will stop after every song and won't play until I hit skip song. If anyone knows a fix for this on HDX it would be cool to know. I'm a paying premium user and most the songs are saved to my Kindle, so why? That's my question. Would love to give a 5 star, but until this bug is fixed I cannot rate higher than 1 star :("
"November 13, 2014","Didn't have the majority of the music I usually listen to and it had trouble launching. Also, the people that came up with spotify don't think of their listeners. Not everyone is the same. There was a very offensive commercial advertising spotify that kept playing and I got tired of hearing it so now it is uninstalled. Act professional people."
"September 15, 2016","Trying to use spotify on my kindle (it used to work like the desktop version where you could choose any song at any time), but now it won't let me play songs AT ALL, even on shuffle (just keeps popping up with the ""get premium so you can play music anytime, anywhere"" message). If someone could help fix the issue or tell me now to uninstall this update that would be wonderful."
"April 2, 2016","I was hoping to use this with Amazon Echo, but I see you have to pay for the premium service. I already have several similar free services, so this was not useful to me."
"February 20, 2017","I really enjoy spotify, even though I don't have premium. I love being about to create a unique and custom playlist to fit my personality."
"November 7, 2015","Not Impressed"
"February 12, 2017","AWESOME selection. Like one of the only things that isn't on here is music by Taylor swift, which Is ok with me in my opinion"

"July 2, 2017","Wish it was easier to pay with gift cards"
"February 6, 2017","This has got to be the most amazing music app ever."
"November 8, 2015","I loved this app! I used it everyday until the recent update locked all my songs and changed it to shuffle only. I have since then stopped using it and returned to youtube because I want to hear my own music. The ads never bothered me, I would deal with them if I could relax to the music I felt like playing at the time. It used to be so simple to use and now it's not. This app is on my kindle and now it just has the phone version of spotify. It's awful."
"March 21, 2017","Wants money"
"January 8, 2017","I wish I could give this no stars. I tried it on my Alexa app for my Amazon Tap. It won't work on the Alexa without going premium. When I try to delete it from the Alexa app it doesn't show ""unlink account from Alexa"" as instructions says. It only has"" link your account"" I guess the icon and premium connection is stuck on my Alexa app forever. Tried to cancel my account on Spotify website. Can't do that either. Instructions suck there also. I just want rid of this account and removed from my Alexa app. UGH!!!"
"August 21, 2016","Great app. Best music app I've used."
"January 28, 2017","I spent a fortune on Amazon and then my Son told me about SPOTIFY...couldn't be happier! Thanx!"
"July 8, 2017","It's very great! It doesn't glitch or nothing. The only problem is when you pause the song the thing goes away. Anything else is wonderful!!! 😊😊"
"April 7, 2016","Yup Its good"
"November 15, 2014","Love it on my computer and phone, but does not work on my Kindle Fire HD."
"July 25, 2015","Spotify is the worst music app, and I don't trust your new &#34;fancy&#34; updates with a new shiny play button and bug fixes. You people are liars, now I am stuck with the update along with two ads playing in a row, and the same bugs I got. Again I DON'T TRUST THE UPDATES!"
"January 4, 2016","Says my email is taken. Cannot get. So thanks to whoever used my email. Now I gotta go download another music app. Pist off"
"March 4, 2015","Did not care for this app at all."
"June 13, 2016","It seemed like there was some popular musicians mixed in with alot more amateur musicians, and I am be nice here.And the worst part Of spotify is the groups and musicans that are popular you could only lesson to one song. But boy you could lesson to the whole ablum by the amateur musicans. The was alot of foreign music. If you are look for some thing likedont even was your free... Try Pandora, its the est and its free to.."
"October 31, 2014","so far I can't connect with it. the app does not work."
"August 7, 2014","I have had the app for three weeks and still can not listen to the songs I want. Every time I hit play it starts playing the ""recommended"" song which is nothing close to the song I chose. To top it off I get at least one email a day attempting to sell me a premium membership. I understand how spotty is supposed to work but my patients attempting to play my selection has worn thin and I will not continue with spotty. Prime music, songza, and my own library will be just fine."
"October 28, 2015","I was told to download this app by a sales rep from my local cell phone provider store. I have tried numerous times to sign up and login but have not been able to. I can't sign up through Facebook because my email is already being used or they are experiencing technical issues, I can't login through email because I have to go through Facebook, I can't contact Spotify because I can't login. I would love to find out why this app has 4.5 stars but I can't even get past the login screen."
"November 26, 2015","This app is falling down the drain. The app once allowed kindle fire users to pick any song on command but now they have took away our ability to do so. We only are capable as working like a mobile device having to click shuffle play in order to play music, even from our play lists. This act they have done is not fair and I vehemently believe we shall be able to freely pick a song on kindle fire tablets."
"September 24, 2014","My brother told me about this and said it was good so I got the app. I had to make a profile, which is acceptable, but then it said I had to confirm it in my email, also acceptable, but I never got an email and it says that my email is already been used and wouldn't let me sign in. Unless you want to go through a bunch of cheap and spend time trying to fix I say NO!!!"
"July 10, 2016","So many functions even if it's the free version"
"April 3, 2016","Spotlight usually has what I am looking for. Been paying for premium for a few years and will continue."
"April 29, 2017","I hate how I'm just trying to listen to my Twenty One Pilots but when I played it, it said: Watch this short video to get 30 minutes of ad-free music. So I'm like OK. So, one three-and-a-half song later, it says: Watch this short video to get 30 minutes of ad-free music and three more ads after that. But it's still a good app because I can make playlists of my favorite songs."
"February 14, 2017","I love this app, because you can listen to your favourite songs! Loving Melody Martinez!"
"February 12, 2017","Can you please update it so you can have clean version and explicit version."
"May 15, 2017","Spotify work's great."
"February 25, 2016","Check internet connection? Everything works except spotify on my phone. Works for a few days then sucks again. After raving to friends and family about this app... I say stay away until they fix it. Premium being canceled... Bye Felicia"
"August 2, 2015","everytime i open the app it says &#34;No internet connection available&#34; and that's not true because 2 seconds later i open netflix and messenger and they work fine. i open spotify expecting it to not work, that's how unreliable it is for me. it rarely does work, and when it does, the ads glitch and spotify stops working because of the ads"
"June 12, 2017","This showed as a purchase in my account and I did not purchase it. I now have to jump through more security hoops to secure my account though I THOUGH I had a pretty secure password."
"May 15, 2016","The app is constantly shuffling my music, even when I don't want it to. On top of that it is always asking to download updates and never does anything after 10 minutes. Until these issues are resolved I will not give a higher score."
"January 1, 2016","THIS IS AN AWFULL APP IT IS SOO HARD TO NAVIGATE WHY CANT I JUST TAP A SONG TO PLAY IT I HAVE TO HIT THE SHUFFLE BUTTON AND HOPE IT LANDS ON THE SONG I WANT AND THE BUTTON DOESNT EVEN WORK MOST OF THE TIME I DONT KNOW HOW PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A GOOD APP"
"March 29, 2016","i don't like being fed the music. i like to pick what i hear. amazon prime is by far the best music site ever!!"
"October 4, 2015","Do not like Spotify. Don't even remember downloading the app."
"June 24, 2014","This app used to be my favorite! I used it everyday for about a year. I recently sold and bought a new tablet it took a few weeks to come in and of course I wanted spotify! So I logged in and was excited to see everything was still there! Here's where the crap comes in..I noticed I couldn't click on the song I wanted so I thought id just skip through shuffle to find it. Come to find out you can only get 5 skips and you can no longer listen to your songs on demand..This WAS my favorite app but now I see it as a glorified Pandora which angers me.....I suppose ill just use the radio..."
"March 10, 2017","This would be a five star review if I could use Spotify on my P MP3 p!ayer. Otherwise, I love this app."
"July 10, 2017","The n ext closest best thing to youtube for this kindle device"
"June 23, 2017","They have all the music I could want and I looked for some oldies. Will definitely keep listening."
"April 29, 2016","This great I get to choose what music I like and very easy to access."
"September 5, 2016","When I open the app its on a ad but when I try anything like play song or it goes away still gives me the play anywhere with premium yet my is working and I'm connected to it. Please do a bug fix update. Thank you"
"June 1, 2017","This app is not working for me. After I made my account, it said ""let's make you a playlist."". It hadna continue button but when I pressed it, it just thought I wanted to skip it. I didn't even have a chance to listen to the music."
"April 1, 2016","I think this app spotify is better than Pandora It is very easy to use and you can get it free!!"
"August 18, 2014","First of all I don't think it works for kindle Fire because I am new too this and I saw all the good reviews and I got on it and I did everything it told me too and it said error and had to start all over 15 times!!!!!!- plz fix this sucks"
"February 15, 2017","You just can't beat it!! All genres and a low price whooping were we!"
"November 14, 2015","One day I went on the app again and it said I had to upgrade to premium to play all of my music that I want to play. I used to love it now I can't listen to my favorite songs so I ABSOLUTELY hate it now!"
"July 21, 2015","I am using the FREE version, and this is what I HATE about it: it dictates the a$$ out of you, not letting you do what you want to do.1.You can't pick and listen to any song you want to at any time. 2. You can't do anything without it saying this: oh magerd ya ned primiumm too doo dis ting$$!!$ 3. It's glitchy as sh!t."
"December 10, 2016","After I listen to two songs it stops and restarts itself rating one star plus it updated and it still does it complete east of time"
"July 13, 2016","I have heard that Spotify is far superior to Pandora, so on a whim I downloaded the app last night. After complaining to my sister today that the only function I can use on my kindle is the shuffle play (literally EVERYTHING else says it is a premium feature you must pay $10 per month to use), she suggested I look at the PC version... What a difference!! I love the computer version, the kindle app? pretty much worthless and just trying to get money. Be wary of the. 5 * reviews... They are either premium users or regarding old versions of this app..."
"November 4, 2015","What is up with this update? I can't even choose songs anymore (whole reason i git spotify over pandora) and I can't see what song is next or shuffle it again trying to get a different song! Why the hell spotify?!"
"November 3, 2017","Spotify is really good, but they have an ad and say ""listen to one ad and get 30 minutes ad free!"" But you usually have to listen to two ads and then you get like 10 minutes without ads."
"June 24, 2016","Oh man, there are no words to this experience. the music and genres and how it knows what kind of music I like before I listen to it is amazing.  always have this turned on during our car rides, commute to work on the train and even in the shower. yes - they have a sing in shower group to follow. love how we can save and share songs."
"December 9, 2016","crashes all the time, loses connection when my phone clearly has internet, stops playing music when the screen is off after a few seconds (it's always the same amount of time before it turns off). It literally is the reason I cancelled my spottily."
"January 25, 2017","Awesome. Any music ii wasn't, less adds would be nice. But otherwise better than anything else I've used. Um. Yeah. That's all I gotta say. 😁👏👍👌"
"July 20, 2015","Don't understand it."
"July 10, 2016","Spotify premium well worth the money far easier to use than ITUNES and my husband and I both use it."
"October 7, 2015","After the update for Spotify running, Spotify songs closed up, you could only choose certain songs if using Spotify Premium, Spotify is now the most greedy. That was my choice! Do not argue! Please, I can rate!"
"March 8, 2016","I personally didn't care for this app"
"November 21, 2016","It's amazing..  It sucks you only get 30minutes of ad free music you should make it 1 hour if ad free music but it's still gr8 . I us it all the time and my boyfriend keeps adding new playlist 😂 I hope you guys enjoy this app you should get Also they should make it were you can listen to music offline.  5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"March 15, 2017","This is the best music app ever"
"August 30, 2014","it wont let me download the app.. someone help? kik me at letkidsbeekids and I have a kindle fire. a regular kindle fire. NOT a hd. and I have a lot of storage left. I checked, and I tried downloading the app 5 times!!! I want the app sooooo bad!! please Kik me if there is something I need to do! thanks!!"
"February 3, 2017","Variety of music is amazing and you can also download the whole album of your favorite artist!"
"January 16, 2017","Plenty of music choices!"
"May 1, 2016","dont use it any longer."
"December 17, 2016","Great variety. Have had it for years."
"July 14, 2016","Very versatile music app. You have the option of listening to radio stations, choosing your own music, downloading music...Putting together playlists are easy and all the music is cataloged in one app. Very user friendly also."
"January 15, 2015","It never loads to the screen.  This is for something else for the maker of kindle fire. Why can't you guys put better apps on here I mean I got this kindle because I thought it be the best tablet for me. But I guess I was wrong. My phone has better game, social, music,and book apps. What about games like clash of clans or all the new game apps coming out on Android or iPhone. kindle is lacking I wouldn't be surprised if people went to get a different tablet. Step your game up"
"June 28, 2017","I can find any song I wanna listen too on Spotify and if I can't find a song I like it shows me songs that I can choose from."
"January 29, 2017","Spotify is the best, works with Alexa, rock on. No lyrics on the app, *😢. Unless I'm not seeing how. Still worth having premium though. I am visually impaired and I can't imagine life without having Spotify and the echo dot."
"December 23, 2016","Great multi-device solution that allows playlists to work online, offline and on all devices."
"March 19, 2017","Brings me such pleasure."
"September 9, 2016","No good"
"April 23, 2017","What could the soundtrack of my life have been like if Spotify were around when I was a kid . . . ? Like the number of kicks to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop, the World will never know . . ."
"February 17, 2017","Good stuff!"
"February 2, 2017","I love it how i can have podcasts and any song i want in one playlist. Just sucks how you need to pay for offline mode."
"February 23, 2017","One of the best music sites out there! I've been using Spotify for at least 3 weeks and I've loved it ever since I first got it. Definitely recommended!"
"December 18, 2016","OMG this is the best music app I have ever used they have whatever song u want and u can make ur own play list with the music u would like to hear!!!! I recommend to get this app u will LOVE it soooo much!!!!!"
"February 27, 2017","I love spotify so much!!!"
"November 26, 2016","I love this app it's awesome! I can create my own play lists and make them public to gain followers! Neat! And it has all my favorite music too!"
"September 9, 2015","Spotify was great for tablet users. We could listen to any song and only had one ad not too often. Then they added another ad (the most annoying being for Spotify) and started playing them more often. But we put up with it because it was still free and we could still play any song. So much for that. Now we are stuck with shuffle mode. I honestly thought there was something wrong when I tried to play a song but couldn't and was dismayed to realize this was an update. Yes, I am grateful for free music and I still prefer it to Pandora because I can at least choose a playlist but this is an awful change. I have not learned to love Amazon Prime music but I guess it will have to do. Bad move, Spotify. Your service is not worth what you charge for premium and now it is not worth listening to the free service. First world problems, true, but it is a shame to ruin a perfectly good app."
"August 15, 2014","I had this app a few months ago and I couldn't stand it because I couldn't access my music. Then, I finally got it again after I deleted it, and I can't even log in. It just freezes after I press the log in button. I do mot recommend this app at all."
"December 25, 2016","Spotify is great. Here you can find so many great songs by many artists. Spotify definitely is worth every second of great music."
"April 6, 2015","Spotify app is on the money!!! I use the free version and I love it. I have found artist and songs that I haven't heard in years. Spotify is unique in that when you search for an artist you get that artist music only. If you want similar artist their name and music is to the right side of the page. No mixing if you don't want to mix.  I love being able to listen to a specific entire album(s) of an artist and that's something you can not do on Pandora... And don't get me wrong, I love Pandora."
"February 27, 2015","only works with wi fi"
"April 16, 2016","LOVE IT!! 🐱🐈"
"September 23, 2016","Its so cool! I get to listen to music on my fire! Its much better than other music apps. Its pretty awesome! I defiantly recommend this app."
"April 9, 2017","It makes my everyday life! Its the app of my life! I like listening to heavy rock or youtuber music like markiplier rap or pewdiepie songs! Its so AWESOME! I play games while listening to it on Saturdays and Sundays at morning! It makes me smile! Keep up the good work!🙋👍👌"
"January 25, 2017","I really like spotify,but there are times when my music stops playing and I have to close and open the app again. Other than that its a good app."
"January 25, 2015","Was absolutely great. Now terrible and useless since the Spotify Connect forced updates. Used to be able to use Spotify app on my receiver by itself. Now HAVE TO use my phone to stream to the home theater receiver or other devices. What's the point of loading your app on my receiver if it will only work from my phone now (as of last week). It wouldn't recognize any devices - after fixing all the bugs and changing my device/receiver settings to get it to work, I realise they've turned a great app to an annoying, useless waste of space. I cancelled my Premium subscription and will uninstall the app. What a shame."
"April 14, 2017","It's awesome! Needs some fixing on kindle but really good overall"
"March 16, 2017","This is the best on the go music app Love It!"
"September 26, 2015","It will not let me log into my existing account. It keeps telling me that I already have an account with that email address (duh) but does not let me log into it even though I tell it to 'log in' as opposed to 'create account.' The effect is that this ap is broken for me and is useless. Anyone from customer service reading this? Respond and help me fix it."
"September 28, 2015","This will NOT give me the option to edit explicit trash content! Why should I be forced to listen to what Spotify sends? I wanted music that I could choose, but I might as well listen to the radio - radio doesn't play the explicit versions. Deleted Spotify and now use i(heart)radio. There, I can edit my preferences."
"March 22, 2017","What's the point of paying PREMIUM SERVICE and getting none! No problems with PLAYLISTS NOT SHOWING UP AND WORKING. I took to YouTube since this issue hasn't been resolved in almost 3 weeks. Glad I switched to GooglePlay! #EffYouSpotify"
"October 25, 2016","Guys This Is A Teen Game Well ITS SO WORTH IT I Love This App So You Got To Get This I AM OUT"
"October 22, 2016","Love it! I can make playlists for my every mood. Never going back to the radio ever again."
"June 3, 2017","Don't work!! I cannot create an account even with Facebook account. Probably could be my region of something."
"April 16, 2016","Being able to select multiple songs to add to a playlist would be much better. Same for desktop app"
"March 15, 2015","Not my favorite .I don't like the fact that you have to pay to listen to the song you want .. there other apps that you can listen without WiFi and whatever song you want."
"March 22, 2017","I love the variety of music and how it's all free"
"February 12, 2017","awesome. just really really awesome."
"September 9, 2015","This new update suddenly won't allow going straight to one song. You have to put it on shuffle, and flip through all other songs to find it. What is up with that? Now that app is barely different from Pandora. I guess it's time to switch back."
"March 29, 2016","This app sucks.😥 I expected a lot more from this app. Don't get this app. I let my sister on this and she found really inappropriate stuff. This app is a waist of your time. I should have stuck with Pandora. I absolutely HATE this app.😣😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😮😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😣😤😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
"April 18, 2017","Love this app!!!"
"August 3, 2016","It is amazing just one thing my music keeps turning off and the playlist is not even done yet but it might be as minor bug easily fixed"
"October 19, 2016","I'm originally on Google Play, which is great and easy to use. I switched to Spotify for the ease of using it with Alexa. However, Spotify is not as easy to use, frequently cuts songs off somewhere in the middle and just stops playing for no reason. I'm going back to Google Play. Google play is a better value, with YouTube red included in the subscription price."
"December 11, 2016","After the week premium ended I couldn't upgrade to premium"
"January 27, 2017","It's Great !!! I Have Premium Its Great Just Awsome !!!!"
"June 4, 2017","Wish they had more songs"
"August 6, 2014","To me I have hear it was a really good app but when I down load it all it does is sits and thinks then it tells me the it has stop even after if re downloaded it"
"January 21, 2015","After I downloaded this app my phone never turned on I had to buy a knew one cause I couldn't fix it"
"February 8, 2017","Great for those with limited resources. Not pushy about buying into level beyond free."
"July 7, 2017","Great . excellent. Wonderful"
"June 15, 2014","its okay I love that all the music is there but when you don't have a data plan you cant really use this anywhere except where there is Internet. :("
"November 28, 2016","Easy to use. Lots of different categories to choose from and the ability to create your own playlist is amazing. Makes work a whole lot easier when you have awesome music to listen to."
"August 21, 2016","This app has it all. I've already created 5 or so playlists.  Bonus, if you pay for the premium service, you can use Spotify overseas with no restrictions. This was so useful while I was in China.  The app rarely crashes on my Kindle Fire and the drop down widget is simply efficient. I would recommend is app to everyone."
"July 29, 2016","In my opinion Spotify is better than Pandora."
"October 28, 2016","Almost any song you want, anytime and for free. All you gotta do is sit through the occasional ad and you can have access to the music that makes life that much sweeter for us."
"July 1, 2016","I love this app! I pay the monthly version, so I have more features, but even without those it's an amazingly easy-to-use music app if you can't afford to buy your favorite songs!"
"May 24, 2017","Decided I didn't want this one."
"November 23, 2015","I do not like the new update for this. You can no longer choose what songs you want to listen to in your list. Please go back to the original please"
"July 24, 2014","This app is not what u expect it to be at first it seems great but unless u have the premium u can only listen to music online. DON'T DOWLOAD!"
"July 24, 2016","Unless you pay for it the free version is loaded with commercials. Understand there's a cost to music but at least let people try to use it with a few less commercials."
"March 30, 2017","Spotify is the best thing ever in music"
"August 12, 2014","Downloaded app...will not open. Anybody out there with suggestions? This is my first experience with a tablet. This is nuts!"
"May 16, 2017","I like this better than Google music"
"March 30, 2016","Just love it....🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵"
"May 6, 2015","Started out thinking good quality on my Kindle Fire but it wasn't until I started getting junk email that wouldn't ""unsubscribe"" that I realized what the this app's primary purpose is. Additionally, this app tries too hard to quess my musical tastes, guesses wrong and repeatedly displays the same limited selections. That app is gone. I wish I could say the same for the emails."
"August 17, 2014","Did not work the way I was looking for."
"March 20, 2017","Find any song you want!"
"March 3, 2017","Awsome i love it so much I usually can't get through the whole day without listening to any song!!!💓💓💓💓💓💓💓"
"June 3, 2017","It was working fine, up until last night. Whilst I was playing my music an add came on, but it didn't go away after a while. So, I deleted and downloaded the app, and the add is still there. Please fix this."
"March 30, 2017","It's fun and awsome"
"March 20, 2017","Best damn music app yet! I love the choice of my play list, or radio, and if I want to share or not! You Rock!"
"March 30, 2016","This is bad!! I just stopped using it for a while and then my search and browse didn't work! Then my playlists starts disappearing! Bugs. I don'tlike that it was having like an expiration! Fix this please! I'm gonna delete my Spotify. Fix, it, please."
"July 11, 2016","My daughter loves this app she can listen to her favorite songs"
"February 23, 2017","I love this app because I can listen to any song I want at any time"
"April 3, 2016","I preach spotify to everyone, every chance I get. It's the future of music listening. Can't find record stores like the old days, but for a better price, you can have any and all albums from almost any artist you can imagine. Best of all, you can take your entire album collection with you anywhere you go without bringing a duffel bag to carry it in. COs are a thing of the past. I see more and more Car stereo decks hitting the scene without CD players but set up for USB, auxiliary input, SD card and Bluetooth. Spotify is THE S#!T !!!!!!!!"
"September 11, 2015","The app won't let me turn shuffle off ever since the update. It says I need premium which is stupid. I understand upgrading for no ads, but for listening to MY music it was fine before the update screwed it up"
"December 27, 2016","This is a great app! I use it every day! You can listen to any song and all the time!"
"November 1, 2017","I absolutely love it! Millions of songs to pick!👌💜💙💚"
"April 1, 2017","Good app but some bad playlist but I love the app and I LOVE that u can make your own playlists"

"December 23, 2016","Decent service"
"December 4, 2015","If I could rate neg stars I would. I renewed our membership and have been paying for 4 months and only free has worked. I've left multiple messages with no contact or solutions for my issue."
"November 16, 2014","Once again, a music downloader YOU CANT SEARCH FOR THE SONGS YOU WANT they have music in categories THEY HAVE you can't search for a song that you want"
"May 16, 2017","Worked great until today. Works on phone and Fire stick but not on Kindle. Tried everything. Not happy since I pay for this. Please fix this,I need to use this app on my Kindle!!!!"
"August 7, 2014","I can only choose one song at a time or else it goes to a similar song right afterwards. Only on the kindel fire version is it like that."
"August 21, 2016","Can't get this to work at all. The selections for music in Spanish are awful."
"May 8, 2017","I don't like this music app because you have to login again and again it's💩💩💩💩don't get this app"

"December 23, 2016","can't askfor anything more..very happy..."
"December 19, 2016","It's a beats it's better than Pandora because you can play your music"
"March 22, 2017","Great app 👂👍👌✊🏃🆒✔‼🔊 enough said"
"August 8, 2014","Dont buy it unless you wanna spend money on premium spotify. Other wise its Pice of s*** and is only good for shuffle."
"August 4, 2014","This app doesn't have the band Tool on it. If you like top 40, run-of-the-mill music, you'll like this app."
"February 2, 2015","Well I was getting ready to listen to music and bam an add comes up im used to adds but this one was diffrent it started and I was like ok it should be done soon 20 minutes later it was still on I had a five bar internet box and it froze after that I restarted it and it was still frozen in the end I had to download and redownload spotify. That takes a lot of time sice im a father with two kids"
"June 4, 2017","Spotify is the number one music app, hands down!! I'd recommend it for just about anyone."
"August 26, 2017","Best music app out there, great. 👍 💙"
"August 8, 2014","not available for my os"
"October 4, 2016","It is a amazing app I love it 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁"
"August 22, 2014","it wont downlaod its being very sucky right now I wish it whould work cuz a lot of people say it works"
"July 17, 2015","Was getting tired of Pandora so I hopped over to Spotify. Overall, I love it! I have the ability to choose the exact songs I want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music, which, btw, is great. I can easily access songs, artists, and albums through the my music section, and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations. I have hundreds of songs which I can access anytime (as long as I have a WiFi connection) and I'm glad the music continues to play when the screen is off (I use the app on a FireHD) I do, however, have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason I am dropping the rating from five stars to four. If I am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time (it's most likely to happen while I'm on the web) the music will sometimes stop playing completely, and I have to go back to to the app and reselect the song. (Which, btw, counts as a &#34;skip&#34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough, will trigger an add) Another similar problem involves the adds themselves: Sometimes an intro to an add will play (fyi I find these intros extremely annoying and useless) and the add itself will not play, even if I choose to play it. Other times the add will just stop playing mid-way through. On both of these occasions I cannot access any music, and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program, which, when I reopen the app, I am gifted with another add. However, through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this app, and I encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try!"
"April 29, 2017","DO NOT GET THIS APP IT SUCKS. The stupid upgrade that I have to get ruins everything because THERE IS NO UPGRADE ANYWHERE. Ever since they asked for the new upgrade you have to get they don't let you play songs, at least not a song you want to play, you can't download anything, play any songs on your playlists, I've had this app for 3 years yet they just lost a loyal customer, GET RID OF THE UPGRADE JERKS. Spotify is going down😤"

"March 19, 2016","This is a great music app! I recimend this app to anyone! Who like apps like like Pandora or iHeartRadio"
"November 29, 2016","Love premium. well worth the endz!"
"February 22, 2017","Great!!!! Only bad thing is I can't upgrade to premium"
"February 5, 2017","One word. Awesome.😊😊😊😊😉"
"October 28, 2015","I used to love the free version of spotify, until it randomly stopped letting me listen to music unless I added it to a playlist. Instead of playing in any chronological order, I have to shuffle my music, so it is bassicaly the same as any other bad music app that ive tried. In order to regain the abillity to listen to songs by clicking on them, I would have to pay for a premium subscription. Just another scam to get people to buy something."
"December 13, 2016","Use the app all the time. Especially while ripping to drums"
"August 8, 2014","Spotify is AMAZINGLY AMAZING! I would say it is much better than Pandora and Iheart radio. You can search your favorite song and listen to it and find the almbum it was on. You can see all the music your favorite artist has and listen to all of their songs. You can like the songs and they will save them you can make your own albums and playlists. All the music is updated so they have the newest music thats still on the radio! They have a feature to this app like pandora where they can pick the music for you too! You have LOTS MORE SKIPS than on Pandora and i heart. You can lots of stations and you can put it as background music! You can just click the song or station you want the exit out of the app and play subway surfers or do what ever you need you can turn it off and the music keeps playing! It helps save battery. You can also follow groups and singers so you can see when they have new music out! I love spotify!   @loviemonsters!"
"June 3, 2017","Excellent,easy to use"
"July 6, 2016","Its a great app. It has a lot of music you can't find anywhere else!!!!"
"August 29, 2014","Don't bother! It won't even download on my kindle. Just use pandora."
"July 17, 2016","I used to use Pandora but I like Spotify better! I didn't really like Pandora cuz you couldn't listen to the songs you wanted to listen to at that time.On Spotify I can listen to the music I want to listen to any time! I can listen to my favorite artists like Melanie Martinez, Twenty One Pilots, and Hasley! This is probably the best music app..........EVER!!😝"
"August 10, 2014","I find it difficult to change from one kind of music to another."
"January 25, 2017","💖all the cool songs"
"June 25, 2016","I wish I had known of this sooner. I paid a lot to download Amazon Music not on Prime. My college son told me about it and he just played a single album and he wasn't familiar with other features. The radio option is great. You choose an artist or a song and Spotify will develop a station of similar music. It's instant and doesn't need to learn your preferences like at Pandora,e.g. My favorite genre of music (other than classical and Blues) is Celtic. I was disappointed when I didn't see Celtic as one of the radio choices. Then I learned about the search feature and entered a Scottish band (The Tannahil Weavers) and up comes all of the Tannies'albums; All for free! I've found out some albums that I didn't know existed. I learned of groups that I didn't known of previously. Again, all for free!!! Amazing app."
"May 30, 2016","Best app love all music love to listen to it..AWESOME"
"May 2, 2016","I love this game get it😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶"
"July 1, 2014","This app is amazing! When I first got it I was gonna give it a test and searched for ""Everything is Awesome"" and it gave me 20 different choices of the song! ""This APP is Awesome!"""
"July 25, 2014","I didn't know I paid for this I don't use it"
"April 14, 2017","Spotify let's you chose songs that you actually like! That is a big helpful step! I hope you agree to Spotify is the best! Rate 5 stars!!!!!!!!💖💖💖💖"
"August 20, 2014","Like the app but hate all the spam emails!!"
"September 24, 2017","This is a great app. You can play almost ALL the newest songs. You can also listen to podcasts. The app personalizes playlist for the user as well."
"May 1, 2017","No porn wft."
"May 15, 2016","Spotify is such an awesome app. In was so glad that I could get it on my kindle!!!"
"July 28, 2014","difficult to figure out how to use"
"June 29, 2016","Better than cruddy Pandora by FAR!😜"
"January 31, 2017","I enjoy my music and i like this app very much..i hear albums in full and I get notified when new stuff is available. thank you"
"June 26, 2017","Very good music app"
"July 8, 2014","I want to cancel"
"December 27, 2016","I can't get premium I'm probably just being stupid but I don't know how to get it pls help!😭😵"
"August 24, 2016","Absolutely one of the best apps I have downloaded. The music selection is immense. I took the free trial and plan to buy the monthly subscription. I am a big music fan. This gives me the ability to experience all genres."
"September 11, 2014","BEST SCAM EVER!!!! At first I couldn't believe people would pay for this service. Then I looked around at the examples of ineptitude around me. YES I CAN. Where to begin... First, disclaimer: I'm an audiophile. I do not get paid or profit in any way, even indirectly from any of these companies. I'm just a true music lover that happens to be logical also, and cannot stand by and watch people make a horrible mistake. So enough said... now let's get to the details. Or if not, skip to the bottom line. 1. Algorithm. Spotify is trying to do nothing else but copy the brilliant Music Genome Project (Pandora) algorithm, but fails miserably. All algorithms have to learn first, that's understandable, the problem is that there is something wrong with this algorithm, or the pool where it has to choose from is just not very good. I picked Alternative at one point, and 2 songs later Spotify shoves a New Age song at me, couple of songs after, I'm listening to Punk Rock. In short, Pandora's algorithm is certainly better, and that's an understatement. 2. GUI. Not horrible, but certainly not the best. Takes a bit to figure out where all is, and it's not automatically intuitive and at the ready. Takes you several clicks just to find where to skip the song being played. Note to developers: THIS SHOULD BE AT THE READY!!!! If it's playing, you have to give the choice to get rid of it on the fly. Minor tick on this one overall, but that skip should be nice and handy, which is a major flaw in my eyes. Nothing like being stuck or having to dig through a couple of menus just to get rid of a horrible song. 3. Paying to play owned music. This at first looked like a plus compared to Pandor, but in close analysis, it makes no sense to a logical person. While superior to Pandora in the fact you can play your own music (if you pay a monthly fee), if you own your music, why do you have to pay to listen to it AGAIN? And pay monthly????? Can someone make sense of this to me? Why are people paying for this, again???? Ridiculous. Developers: The idea to mixing streamed music as part of payment, should go hand in hand with being able to play the customer's already owned music FOR FREE!!! Otherwise, why even have this feature? Customers could just buy Poweramp, which they only have to pay for it once, for less than your monthly fee, AND has superior and more thorough features than your service. Let the people play their owned music for free. 4. Equalizer. Oh yeah, 5 bands. TOTALLY IMPRESSED. Look up Poweramp. 5. Cost. So basically, the only reason to buy this service, is to listen to new music on the fly, unlimited, right? Oh wait, the algorithm is not that good. Well, guess you will listen to music you don't like...A LOT. Oh yeah, and to boot, you want people to pay for the same thing as given by Pandora, but pay TWICE AS MUCH per month??? Did I mention this is a brilliant scam? HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE: If you want to listen to new, streamed music monthly, get Pandora (for half the price). If you want great sound quality and hands down the best music player in mobile, get Poweramp. Oh yeah, and you only have to pay once (for several devices, not just every device), and will cost you less than what you will pay in one month for Spotify."
"November 1, 2016","I like spotlight but I hate that u need premium and hit shuffle play and choses a random song"
"June 13, 2016","Free app but then you have to subscribe to the service"
"June 16, 2016","Cant get it to register or log in on my Kindle Fire."
"October 25, 2015","This app was great. It has anything I could want to listen to, which is cool since I like pretty much everything. But now, since the new update doesn't allow you to pick your own songs, I can't listen to it anymore. I've tried using it, but it's frustrating trying to find a specific Misfits song or something, then suddenly, I get stuck on a band I didn't even want to listen to. Until Spotify let's me pick my own stuff again, I'm deleting it"
"August 1, 2016","I really like that I can listen to music that I had thought was gone forever. Being able to listen to groups that I've loved in the past so great ! I also get to listen to new music that I could never afford to purchase is awesome ! Thanks for being there for me and other people ."
"February 3, 2017","I can listen to all my favorite bands! Breaking Benjamin and sum 41"
"June 17, 2016","To expensive after the first month."
"May 14, 2016","I love the app because all the other music apps on the kindle fr. Have bad reviews and I thought I will try this app I love it I recommend it. And the updates are always good updates I haven't had any problems with the app so I am gonna keep using Spotify.😉"
"August 5, 2016","It is a good app for people to listen to music"
"June 12, 2016","I love this apps, I have put all the oldies that I know and love on my list and can listen to them anywhere, great apps."
"December 23, 2016","👍👍 geeqrt so far! Hate the eds but refuse to pay extra"
"July 16, 2016","I don't have this one"
"April 14, 2017","The Hedgehog."
"December 23, 2016","The app is awesome I can see my friends playlist and make my own such an awesome app Deserves Google stars"
"April 14, 2017","Its amazing"
"April 2, 2016","I love it because I can use my aux cord to my truck and no ads because now there is premium"
"August 5, 2016","Amazing app but it's always promoting the premium. Otherwise it is definitely good"
"June 4, 2016","Lousy"
"September 30, 2016","Going anywhere"
"December 22, 2016","There are A LOT of artists that they don't have. Missing albums for many of the artists that they do have (for many of the ones I follow and have in my playlists). The ads for their own company will blow out your eardrums. Don't know why they have to have them be so loud. It doesn't really change when you lower the volume on the device you have.  The app cuts out shortly after I enter my browser or go to text. It forces me to remain on the app at all times. Can't even browse Facebook.  Yeah, you should get it but be prepared for manual updates and a long list of problems."
"July 15, 2016","Sucks"
"July 24, 2016","Enjoy the playlist. Find the flash backs! Thanks!"
"December 17, 2016","its very good you should try"
"February 9, 2017","This app has all the music that u love"
"September 10, 2017","Wow!This app is the bomb!You can follow your favorite artists and make playlists and search up a million songs ,plus its FREE.Don't forget you can go to the browse and there are things like songs to sing in the shower,hip hop,sugar rush,dance fit,etc.And its better then Pandora,iTunes,Amazon. It bets them all!"
"July 15, 2016","Spotify just Rocks! it Has Many song that i Can want and More Thanks Amazon and Spotify for being able to play it on the Fire Tablet Thanks. Sign By Teddy Furstman.  P.S. It has the Entire Beatles catalog all in one Streaming Service Thanks Spotify and Amazon. Sign By Teddy Furstman."
"June 5, 2017","Works flawlessly."
"April 3, 2016","This is so awesome if u don't have it u should get it !!!!!!!!"
"September 16, 2014","I have never had an MP3 or an IPOD and never before listened to music on my phone, but Oh My Goodness, I love Spotify Music on my phone. Don't know how I did without it. I have listened to songs I haven't heard in years and years. Thanks so much for this ap!!!!!"
"April 5, 2016","Almost 5 star"
"June 30, 2014","I have a premium account, but my playlists don't show, and it asks me to sign up for premium. I downloaded it twice, but with the same results. I'll stick to Spotify on my computer and phone."
"November 9, 2017","Best music app"
"April 1, 2017","I got it and I loved it but you don't really get followers"
"June 3, 2017","Love it!!!!! The music never stops and pauses. I'm using it on my kindle because its better than using it on my phone!!!!!"
"July 1, 2014","Such a great app! I love this one better than all the other ones, if you pay for premium services you can listen to full albums of any artist! Thank you some much for making my work day a better one."
"October 23, 2016","Spotify has most the music that I need for my life. There may be ads but is worth it. They may not have unpopular artist but most of the artists are in spotify, and you may have to pay for offline but it's still great. So I just hope you try out spotify and enjoy (:"
"April 13, 2017","Love this app! I wish you could listen with no WiFi like Netflix but I still love this app!!!👌👌👍👍"
"January 16, 2016","With the change of apple software to focus around their own services, using my enormous collection in iTunes match just got a whole less easy on my phone. So, I looked at options and thought I'd try spotify. So far I really like it. I love hearing new stuff and the play lists are great. They have a bunch of playlists focused on work and study. I work for myself and I find myself using their playlists every day. I have an all apple home and office, but I think I'll stick with spotify rather than apple music."
"January 26, 2017","I love this app! it gives you the oppurtunity to listen to any song you want without paying!"
"August 28, 2014","It won't install on my Kindle Fire 1st gen. therefore, I can't give it a fair review. I downloaded AccuRadio and am satisfied with that so, to me, it's no big loss that Spotify won't install."
"February 20, 2017","its awesome you can listen to any type of music that you want"
"November 9, 2015","Alright, so I was just going on spotify today and hit a song when the shuffle button like jumps (?) or something. So I click that and it doesn't even give me the song I chose. So I realize what they have done and so being all sneaky like, I create a playlist with one song on it, again, press shuffle, and what do I get? A SONG THAT ISN'T EVEN ON THERE!!!! 'Recommended' they call it. Wow spotify business people, that's all I have to say, just wow. (I WILL NEVER USE AGAIN UNTIL CHANGE)"
"June 30, 2014","it was great at first but then it just turned out to suck because after a while i couldn't choose a song that I wanted to listen to unless i paid.."
"February 3, 2017","This app is okay but I hate how it sucks on mobile and computer is hard to navigate."
"June 19, 2014","I have lost the app on my Surface and it won't let me reload it. Always love paying for something that is not being provided."
"July 17, 2014","Ok, so I want to listen to a specific song right, with good old spotify I can do that right, NOT! If you want to listen to a specific song, you have to get lucky enough for shuffle play to roll onto that song."
"June 4, 2017","I downloaded this app twice now. The first time it said I wasn't connected to the internet. Second timer it wouldn't even log in. I sent an email to support and an waiting for a reply. Guess I need to find a better music app for my Kindle."
"April 16, 2017","I would recommended this to any one"
"May 21, 2016","57 yo an have great music at my fingertips. Love it!"
"July 26, 2014","I wish I could rate it a zero. I search a song and comes up with something totally different. I absolutely hate it"
"December 15, 2016","Great selection, if only it was hi-def..."
"June 20, 2016","This app works great for my general listening. I do have to search a little deeply for my more obscure songs, but overall I have been able to find what I want.  In the end, if you don't want the clutter of a million discs, this is a decent alternative if you pay for the subscription."
"July 20, 2014","It would be an awesome app if 1) it had just normal play which is only included in the paid version. 2) starts off with a free 7 day trial for the premium version then the 30 day free day trial with an attached credit card. Id recommend other music apps before this one."
"October 19, 2017","Great app for music all your favorite songs right in a search bar and you don't have a limit listen to all your favorite songs get it"
"September 22, 2016","i love this app. i can listen to whatever i want!"
"June 3, 2017","As of June 3, 2017 Won't let me log in. Tried reinstalling and it still won't let me in."
"June 25, 2014","Sorry cannot comment on this app as it will not let me register, I presume it is because I live in Spain but have a UK email address and it doesn't seem to like this."
"June 28, 2017","It works fine on my ps4 but on my kindle I can't even sign up."
"April 1, 2017","Worst app ever"
"June 3, 2016","Huge variety of music and pre-made / random playlist. Great browsing and easy to use. Love how it sync's up to almost all of my devices. Use it daily whether I'm listening to it on my Fire Tablet while reading, going jogging in the morning using it on my phone. Or even playing it on my ps4 through my T.V. while playing a game or just listening to it in the background. Offline playlist are nice for not eating up data with no wifi. Great Music App, its worth full membership for anyone who listens to music all the time in my opinion."
"October 26, 2016","This app is great, there are a few songs I couldn't find but overall its great. The commercials aren't all that bad. They rarely ever bother me"
"March 9, 2017","Great selection, love classical music. Lots of choices. And it is free. That is great."
"September 12, 2015","I really love this app. No doubt about it. The thing is, though, they now have limited the features for non premium members. For example, you can't pick the song!!!! I find this super dumb, honestly. Also, you can't take ot off shuffle now. Its sorta dumb."
"January 29, 2017","This is the best app I could ever have on my kindle. I hope everyone will like it as much as I do. You can listen to any song you ever imagined."
"April 7, 2016","Outstanding!"
"June 18, 2014","Not much to say- it's stable, it's an awesome service, and I can play everything through the Bluetooth speaker in my kitchen with minimal hassle."
"August 20, 2016","Better than pandora #Jesus 💜 u"
"April 25, 2017","Gonna sell my kiindle"
"December 9, 2016","App quality is not great. App becomes unresponsive after Minutes of playing. Can't even force close it."
"March 17, 2017","This is by far the best app for listening to music. You can listen to anybody, anywhere, any time. It's incredible. One problem I have with the most recent update, however, is that I can't seem to be able to add anything to any of my playlists. I tap the ""add to playlist"" button and nothing happens. Please fix this as soon as possible."
"April 23, 2017","Idk I only like Spotify because of how much music they have, that's an ok amount.. There's way to many ads and they're too long, this isn't TV, these aren't commercial break.. these ads don't need to be 4 mins long.. For a few 3 minute songs.. That's horrible, Spotify makes me wanna Kermit 🐸"
"April 5, 2016","This music app is probably the best music app out there I lidsten to music 24/7 and this one actually stays on the person, band, or whatever instead of going to other things lile Pandora does"
"April 19, 2016","Stops playing and won't restart without turning off and usually have to wait several minutes before it will start again. Also won't play entire playlist - stops after each album and can't get it to continue same playlist. I always have to go to another playlist. I am very disappointed in Spotify after reading the good reviews on the app. When I went to the help.section , I saw many others who were having the same problems I have with the player stopping so often and the responses from the help center indicate they have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it. If the problem is not corrected soon I will look for another music, etc app. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
"April 2, 2017","I love Spotify! I can listen to any song I want! I can listen to just one band without other bands playing with it! Spotify is the best!"
"July 22, 2014","Too many adds and does nothing better than others out there like Pandora and Amazon Prime Music!"
"April 8, 2016","Great to take music on the road with you when your radio won't pick up local stations"
"April 22, 2017","Love it I got premium and it really works :)"
"August 17, 2014","Useless. Refused to open. Locked up my Kindle fire.  Just a practice in app removal."

"February 27, 2017","I have tried a lot of music apps and a I could get were a few of my favorite songs but with spotify i have 90 percent of my favorite songs and that is incredible to me it's not easy finding meatloafs bat out of on hell 1 and 2 for me"
"September 3, 2017","I really love this app! It has all the songs and albums I was looking for, and it's very organized and super easy to use!!!😊"
"February 27, 2017","Good Music"
"February 20, 2017","Love the ability to use in conjunction with Shazam!"
"September 24, 2017","Love this app you can play every song but a few,and you can watch music videos,make podcasts and and have your own music for free"
"September 12, 2015","This new update sucks you have to pay to put ur songs off of shuffle which is stupid yiu didnt have to do that before but you do now. Spotify ruined there music for me im deleting this and I dont recommend wasting your money to to upgrade."
"January 25, 2017","when I press login it freezes"
"June 15, 2016","Omg!!! I love this app!!!! Definitely recommend getting it!"
"December 10, 2016","it's fast and easy, i love it !!"
"October 2, 2014","I've only been on Spotify for a week now, but I think this may replace Pandora as my favorite music app. Like Pandora, you create your own stations. However, you can pick only the songs you want to hear right from the beginning. It's not like you ""seed""the station with a song or artist, then watch it go into crazy directions. Yes, it only shows a certain amount of skips, but if you create your own playlist with the songs you want, then it really isn't a big deal. In addition, you do have to hear the occasional advertisement, but they are few and far between. The big difference to me is the cost of premium membership. I believe Pandora charges about $30/year, while Spotify is $10/month. That is a huge difference, however Spotify let's you not only listen without interruption, but you can skip to your heart's content, and listen to ALL your favorite songs. AWESOME! Despite the advantages, I think I'll stick to the free version. Just can't justify $120/year for music."
"November 24, 2015","I listen to A LOT of music and a lot of it is alt-country, folk, and Americana. Other than purely local bands (and even some of them are here), Spotity has even some of the most obscure music I love. It has way more than other subscription services I've tried. The quality is fantastic. The only thing I would change is to provide other ways to organize music. I also find frustrating that what I listen to on one device is not saved to another. I use a lot of devices - - two smartphones, a tablet,Chromebook, and two laptops. Unless I add what I'm listening to to a playlist, I won't find it on the next device I open. That device will have only the music I listened to on that device. I also miss liner notes  But these are small points to what is otherwise a fairly priced service, at least for someone like me who listens a lot. The free service is fine for casual listeners who don't mind commercials Hey, someone has to pay the bills.  Subscription services are the future of music. My own vast collection of music is almost irrelevant. I choose albums I already own from Spotify because it's just more convenient. I HOPE my favorite artists are adequately compensated when I listen to their music on Spotify. I just have no idea of the financials of this model. It certainly works for major commercial artists, but that's not my scene. Are my favorites getting decent micro payments or would I be more supportive if I bought their CDs? When I have bought CDs, I end up listening on Spotify. On the other hand, I still buy and listen to LPs and their is no digital substitute for them."
"December 8, 2016","Would give it 5 stars of you could turn on or off spirit connect as it causes my phone app to turn on spotify and use battery life"
"February 28, 2017","I absolutely love this app. I've tried many others and in my opinion, this is the best. The only problem iis that it takes up too much space in so little songs. If there is a way to fix that, I would love it. Thank you for an otherwise great app."
"June 15, 2016","I really really love this app better then Pandora or any other music app that I have tried"
"May 14, 2016","Sooooooooooo fun and awesome much better than I-tunes"
"January 1, 2015","It would not download on my Kindle - removed from device and tried reloading 3 or 4 times. Very disappointed!"
"June 24, 2014","Downloading to the Kindle Fire HD did not go well from the Spotify website. Several attempts were necessary, possibly due to the screen size and location of data entry fields. After installation I searched for and selected an album to listen to, but could not locate the play button; but a shuffle play button was available. This started music but switched to a genre' format not allowing the songs from my selected album to be heard in order. This may be fine at times for some users. Odd that I did not see this limitation when downloaded to my WINDOWS 7 PC. Like PANDORA, product adds will be heard after so many songs. I have not tried the premium version of Spotify for the KINDLE FIRE / ANDROID / TABLET. I may try downloading again to see if I missed something."
"April 29, 2016","Very good and perfect for music"
"November 16, 2014","Would not let me use it. They did not like my profile age. I guess I am to old."
"January 25, 2017","Love having my favorite songs nearby"
"November 14, 2016","Spotify is the best go-to music app available. I have had an account with Spotify for a few years now, and I have not been disappointed. I have discovered many great songs by artists that would never have radio play because stations play the top 20 nonstop. I have created so many playlists, and if you are a paid member you can have songs offline to listen when away from wifi and to not use data. There are also already user created playlists you can save or listen to, and I honestly use one with Native American drums to fall asleep every night! It has helped with insomnia! I also have added a family account so my kids can have their own playlists, which I can keep track of. At anytime I can add or remove songs from their lists as the primary account holder. It is a good way to give them some music freedom, without it being explicit songs I would never know about. The app itself can be used free, but with some limitations. Give the paid membership a try just once, and you'll understand. Love, love, love Spotify!"
"March 16, 2017","Its great how you can pick your favorites then play them and listen while using other apps!"
"December 11, 2016","Everything I look for is here."
"February 2, 2017","Awesome app for those who can't live without music!!"
"November 9, 2015","Originally I loved the app, I could look up songs and listen to them to make sure I found the right version I was looking for, now when I search a song I can't listen to it at all until I add it to my play list and then I have to wait since the app only allows songs to be played in shuffle mode. I liked it much better when I could listen to the songs when I wanted to. I understand with a free app I should expect ads, I don't have a problem with that, but this shuffle mode and not being able to hear a song sample makes this app terrible. I will be looking for a new way to listen to my favorite songs."
"February 3, 2017","This is a wonderful app You can pick any song you want you just type the songs name then it will show different artist who made a song with that title and I bet you 100 percent your song you want wiil pop up"
"December 3, 2016","THIS APP IS AN AWESOME APP.YOU CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC ANYTIME YOU WANT UNLESS YOU HAVE WIFI ,BUT IF YOU GET SPOTIFIY PREMIUM YOU CAN LISTEN TO ANY SONG ANYTIME.I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING THIS APP OR YOU WILL RETREAT NOT GETTING IT."
"November 7, 2014","I LOVE spotify it works awesomely on My android and my computer but on my kindle I'm lucky to get it to play one song it freezes up somtimes or it will tell me that the song is unavailable or like right now it's telling me that the song is playing but it's not no sound is coming out I really wish it would work I listen to it all the time with my phone but on my kindle I have to listen to Pandora please fix it"
"March 7, 2017","This app is half good and half bad,the good part about it is,it's music and its free,but its also bad because it wants you to buy premium for $9.00 or more,which some people dont have (me)so if you have the money than good,you'll like the app,but if you don't have the money than,I don't recommend getting it"
"January 1, 2015","Deleted -- free to download and the it costs"
"November 2, 2015","So I've had spotify for a few months now and I've loved every bit of it. A few days ago though it locked my songs and wouldn't let me click on them, and I could only press shuffle and only skip a certain number of songs. NOT COOL SPOTIFY. If you want to keep your users and keep your ratings high, please go back to the older version, everybody likes that one better. I'm going to delete my profile on Spotify and find a better app. (Spotify is turning into Pandora)"
"June 23, 2017","Awesome appeared"
"June 5, 2017","I actually use spotify un my ps4 to hear music while gaming! This app is awesome because it also has playlists that have the música u da music u want so u dont have to change the music everytime! ITS AWESOME!!! 😎👍"
"June 26, 2014","Never ever get this spotify for kindle fire hd because it won't let you press the song you want to play. You have to always press shuffle play! If you want a good app to play music, I suggest Pandora. Don't get spotify!"
"July 10, 2016","I love spotify. It lets you enjoy music while doing other things and when you go on YouTube/internet or games it will automatically pause. You can pick your own songs by searching them and adding them to playlists and you can listen to other peoples playlists by looking them up. You should definitely check it out."
"June 28, 2017","I like it but it keeps putting on songs that aren't on my playlist"
"November 6, 2015","So this app used to be awesome, you could listen to whatever music you want, except there would be ads, which is fine because I didn't have premium. I still didn't want to get premium because I don't necessarily feel like paying 9 bucks a month just To listen to music. But recently they changed EVERYTHING!!! Now you can't listen to a freaking song without hitting &#34;shuffle play&#34; and after that it gives you other songs that you don't even like and it doesn't let you listen to your own songs. Now you can't skip either, and you can only listen to 1 freaking song on your playlist, then it starts playing the suggested songs which you can't skip. Seriously?! Now it'd just making it so you HAVE to upgrade! What's the freaking point anyway?! You can just use YouTube and make playlists. Don't get spotlight unless you get premium!"
"June 8, 2016","I just recently discovered this app. It is great! You can choose any genre that you feel like listening to. You can change your mind; you can go from a station to just one artists songs. There is nothing stopping you from changing your mind as often as you like. Perhaps you'll start out with Taylor Swift, then switch to Blake Shelton, or maybe you just want to listen to RIFF. You can switch back and forth at any time. There is every kind of music you can think of ."
"September 21, 2016","This app is awesome"
"July 28, 2014","If I could figure out how to get premium, I'd rate it 5 stars. Without premium, it's terrible. When you try to activate a premium feature, it just tells you that you can't activate it. It doesn't even tell you how to get premium, and I can't find the premium option anywhere. Unless you know how to get premium, do not get this app because it will be a waste of time."
"May 3, 2016","Enjoy Spotify and the variety of music."
"June 27, 2016","He seemed disappointed at first, only downloading the app on his cellular phone, but then I told him about how we only had one very worn record of the Ink Spots, and that changed his tune. More specifically he changed the tune to the Ink Spots, as I told him all about the times I heard these songs durring my youth."
"July 22, 2016","Love this for work"
"October 26, 2017","I love the selections and the ease of downloading. The FREE version meets my needs."
"November 3, 2016","Anybody who loves music has to have Spotify. This is an amazing app that just keeps getting better, well worth the price for the paid version, but there is still a free version as well, I believe. I can plug my phone into my stereo, then sit in some other room of the house and control what plays from my Kindle. A seemingly endless supply of music. I have fun trying to stump the system by asking for obscure artists, I usually am surprised that it finds what I am looking for. I'm not sure if there is a way to suggest additional artists or albums, but that would be a nice addition if there isn't."
"April 4, 2016","I am so in love with Spotify! I can find anything I am in the mood for! Fantaso!!"
"June 3, 2017","Had the app on my phone, wouldn't let me play my playlists at all, only on shuffle play. Like it better on Kindle and on a laptop, no problems there."
"October 29, 2015","I used to use spotify all the time. Now since the new update came out I can only listen to music on shuffle. NOT only that but I created an account because it gave you an unlimited amount of skips, and you could choose the song you wanted. Now they are just like Pandora. Unless you pay of course. Seriously disappointed, I thought this music app would be different. I guess not."
"October 12, 2016","Don't tell spotify but this app works just like the desktop version and not the mobile version making this app f***ing amazing. Don't change how beautiful this is Spotify."
"November 5, 2015","I was introduced to Spotify by my son and immediately fell in love with it. I have a very eclectic taste in music and Spotify allows me to sample, search and/or select whatever suits my fancy at the moment. I particularly like the ""Discover"" function which recommends albums/performers/selections based on my past selections, but does delve into areas I had not previously encountered. That route has introduced me to performers I had never heard of in the past (and my past is pretty extensive). Also Spotify has allowed me to compile personal playlists of albums and/or selections that I particularly like. I use only the free download so I do have to listen to short commercials now and again (and they are repetitious), but since most of my music listening is via radio, that is no biggie. I highly recommend Spotify to music listeners of any genre>"
"July 18, 2017","It works well on a tablet so get it it may ask you for a email"
"February 8, 2016","Very ""manual transmission"" in design. For some, this is a great thing. You control EVERYTHING about your catalog, You can choose songs or albums to save. I'm ambiguous on what ""follow""-ing an artist actually means... but whatever. For those that are stuck in automatic transmission mode (pick some thing and let it unfold how it wants), all this freedom can seem horrifying, It took me a few days to re-adapt myself to the freedom that the app offered.  No consideration is really given for what you already own. This could be frustrating if it isn't considered that a person can arbitrarily add any single track (that the service is aware of) to the person's own catalog.  For a person with a PC background, trying to add things (while the well behaved android thing runs) can be confusing/annoying. This isn't a criticism of the app, which seems to do fairly expertly what it does... But, The ""Oh, ya. There might be desktop users."" thing seems to be an afterthought. This isn't a criticism of the app itself. It can only do what it is programmed to do, But, [desktop user manipulating user's library] seems to (unfortunately) be an afterthought at best.  As to music sources, there's few things lacking as I can tell. In particular (as of this date). Yanni - Optimystique seems to be absent, and to access the songs I remember I have to use ""Winter Light"" (a newer album/rehash, or whatever). I can live with that."
"July 2, 2017","Let's me listen to song I haven't heard in years. It's cheap to be able to listen to just about any song or group you can think of and create your own play list."
"February 19, 2017","This is stupid and you can get the premium!!!!!#this suck"
"June 22, 2014","I like that there is an app for Kindle for Spotify because it is instantly addicting, not having to pick out songs to play yourself. I notice the app plays short ads, where for some reason I don't if I use the web page on my PC, maybe because there is room on a full sized monitor to run visual ads."
"June 14, 2014","The app is not working on a samsung gio smartphone. The message is that it is not supported. Can't use it"
"July 27, 2016","I don't understand how anyone wouldn't get this. You don't even need premium (unless you want more songs). This app is great for listing to a specific song any time you want."
"May 8, 2017","I can't listen with out WiFi because ii don't have data.😕😊"
"September 7, 2017","I love this music app, I can listen to my favorite songs any time I want."
"December 14, 2016","I love the music they reproduce"
"June 23, 2017","You guys need to add back Dr Dre's album the chronic. The chronic would have a lot of downloads and Spotify would be really popular and probably have more downloads. Or so  -Eric Petersen  Ps- Add the chronic"
"May 5, 2016","Works great when others dont"
"November 22, 2015","It was a good music service until they made it like mobile where you have to shuffle rather than play any song you want. Especially sucks when you listen to bands who's albums are like books: meant to be listened to from beginning to end, not out of order."
"March 27, 2016","This is a great music app! I love how you can listen to any song on an album and download songs (premium) to listen to without using data! Great app just one issue: It just randomly pauses and when I go to look at the app the pause button isn't hit and it won't resume playing unless I hit pause and play again. Great app just had that one issue. Definitely recommend over Pandora, Slacker, iHeartRadio, etc"
"November 24, 2014","Was happy for one day with this app...loved it the it decided to only give me the option to shuffle there is no longer a play option for individual songs. I don't want to sit here and wait for the song I want to hear to randomly play!!"
"July 14, 2017","Great music app. Love the weekly discovery feature and the daily mixes."
"July 30, 2016","I tried signing up to use this app and I can't it won't let me do Facebook sign up or email :( guess that was aa waste of data to download"
"August 7, 2016","It's great for people who have unlimited data.... My main issue is that there is no hotbar player for when the app is open. I don't enjoy having to go back from Silk to Spotify to skip a song. P.S: I'm using a Gen 2 Kindle Fire that was purchased in 2012."
"March 21, 2016","The Premium version is very good!"
"August 5, 2014","P2w bulls***, sucks m8"
"October 28, 2017","I love the songs that they put on the app from TV shows\games"
"April 4, 2016","Great app all good music"
"August 4, 2014","I tried to play a tune from the list and it wont let you. Instead it says SHUFFLE, meaning they mix up the songs you hear. If you go to a premium choice (which probably costs money) you can have the freedom to choose and select. These sights interrupt your listening to inject commercials and if you want to pay money they stop. Its like free....but at a cost. When cable companies first started competing with long established network stations for viewers their mantra was, ""we know you have to pay for cable, but we don't tie you down with endless commercials. Has anyone watched cable programming lately? Now you pay large sums for the cable and they inundate you with ads. Pandora is the same.....don't want to pay, we interrupt your play. It's all about the money and getting more."
"October 25, 2015","I used to love the Kindle Fire version. I liked how it was basically the same as the computer version. No harm was done. I was fine without premium. The ads didn't bother me too much. Then, the new update happened. Now its the exact same as the phone version. I have always hated the phone version for a reason. There is basically no freedom on it. I already have to limit my time on Spotify because this tablet only connects to wifi, but now I just don't want to use it. There was no harm in keeping this version the same as the computer. Profit isn't an excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you as a company are crippling artists' profit at the same time. I'd rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price is a lot more reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I'm really encouraging you to change it back because I guarantee that you've lost many users to this and you're just going to lose more. I used to recommend Spotify to people, but now my view has changed. Its just not worth it anymore, so I'll just spent my time warning people off of this half baked app. You're Welcome, Spotify"
"July 27, 2017","I love spotify, it lets me listen to all of my songs legit anywhere I go. It makes playlists for me judging by my music and I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. Five stars for Spotify!!!"
"June 13, 2016","This app sucks. When I installed it the app wouldn't respond. It was maybe the lack of internet in my house but the app is awful."
"February 18, 2015","Spotify has an amazing selection, no doubt. The ability to create your own playlists, surf from one related artist or group to another (in other words, discover new music economically) by listening to the entire track, and to listen offline (Premium only (it's a coded special file, so don't think you get to keep it permanently) is truly great for the listener. However, the artists are severely underpaid. Services like this one are a slap in the face for the creative geniuses that move you emotionally. If you want to do them justice, be more than a complacent consumer and tell Spotify that you demand more support to the artists they profit from. Hold Premium hostage! Only get the free version until they change their ways!"
"June 17, 2016","Excellent!"
"June 16, 2017","I've been using Spotify for several years now, and I have to say, it's my streaming app of choice. First of all, you can find almost anything on it, from music to even things like guided meditation or audio books. So it's the first place I search when I hear about a new artist or song. Or if I'm looking for an old song or an artist I used to love but lost track of over the years. And lots of people, from celebrities to critics will post special playlists you can choose from as well. I'm constantly reading articles that send you to a new playlist worth checking out. I also love being able to use downloaded playlists offline if I'm driving or flying, too.The app itself is pretty foolproof, though sometimes searching can be a little bit tricky. And you still can't alphabetize your playlists, which gets messy. . Nothing else works as well or has so much to offer yet."
"June 21, 2016","There is nothing I can say about Spotify that hasn't been said a million times before. This program is simply amazing. For just over $10.00 a month I can listen to any song pretty much ever created. I get the new radio singles, new albums, singles from weird indie bands I've never heard of, customized playlists, Sunday playlists for when I want to chill, the ability to search by song, artist, or album and I can save anything I want to find it later. For how much music I listen to (every day, constantly, non-stop), I simply cannot exist without the variety and ease Spotify provides. If you don't have a membership, get one ASAP. This is how music playing should be! I have it installed on my computer, cellphone, and Kindle so I have access to it from literally anywhere. Please and thank you!"
"October 9, 2016","I hate when I try to make a que and load albums together and it shows up on my currently playing album so I have to drag songs from current album from bottom to top"
"June 28, 2017","Great selection of great music"
"October 7, 2016","I love It but It's a little glitchy all whenever I get an ad advertisement the video it always glitches an IT CRasHes .so when I uninstalled the app it says MY OwN email and right PAsSword is invalid I used my email the first time but......When it crashed I had to uninstall it and only because I love it I downloaded it again and my right email address was wrong I changed my own PAsSword so............................I got used to making my own email and my own PAsSword all this because I love spotify and the cycle goes again but you go and click that download Bu5tton ... take that five out poor five but have to take it out you have to see the word because also the five is going to take over the WORLD  I'm funny.RiGhT¿ 😹🔨🚿🛁🏉🏊🏨🏰🗿🏰🏩🏮🏮🏰🏮🏩🏯🏯🏯🏰😊 get it you have to and take my advice get it seriously..."
"June 27, 2015","THE best music app of all! I was a subscriber to a monthly music service for years. Then I found out about Spotify. I had several gigabytes of music files on my computer and in the cloud. When I found Spotify, I made the decisione to get rid of all that and save space on my hard drive.You don't actually BUY the music, so you can't burn CDs or make other copies, but you CAN have the app on all your devices, so the music goes with you wherever you want. I connect the Bluetooth on my phone to my car's sound system, so I can listen to what I want....and no commercials! You can create your own playlists and fill them with the actual music you want...not 'sounds like' the music you like And the best part is that you can make your playlists available offline, so you don't have to have an Internet connection to listen to your music.Another nifty feature of Spotify is the ability to view the lyrics of what you're listening to if you want. All the information about the artist is also available if you want to know more about the artists you're listening to.  And for those people who are devoted to social media, Spotify also allows you to connect with friends and see what they are listening to and you can make your playlists public as well. I don't use those features, but they are available.  This is the app I use more than any other on my devices. I just love it."
"May 14, 2016","Glad I downloaded it."
"May 11, 2017","The music is great, they have near everything. Wish you didn't have to pay to play the immediate song you wanted to instead of putting it on shuffle. Otherwise, great app that you should totally get!!"
"December 8, 2016","This music app is so much better than Pandora lol."
"August 12, 2016","I use Spotifyt all the time, and I have a favorite playlist on Spotify that I listen to each morning when I read the paper. Spotify doesn't have some of the bells and whistles of iTunes or Amazon Music; but the search feature is easy to use, and it's very easy to create and modify playlists. I especially like the fact that it plays through my Amazon Echo."
"November 18, 2016","Spotify became my ""GO TO"" app for streaming music. I like the variety and flexibility. I like Spotify best when it works with my devices. It does NOT work on my Kindle Fire. I have gone to the dev sight and they do not provide for feedback which would allow them to discreetly fix issues. They do have a tab that says FEEDBACK but it is a goat rope. The app works great on my Samsung devices but it does not work on Amazon devices. Go figure."
"June 2, 2016","I love my music. And I love having it all around me at all times. And I feel like with Spotify, you can go on any device, log in and listen to all your favorite Playlists and Albums and Singers. And I swear I'm not trying to sound like a commercial or anything, I just find Spotify to be a very efficient way of listening to music, and without music I would be totally lost to the world. So, what I'm trying to say is, Spotify is a very easy and manageable way of listening to music, new or old, at all times. And, yes, it has commercials, but only one every 30 minutes and, apparently, with Spotify Premium, you can have music with NO commercials for 3 months for 99¢!!! I love Spotify."
"July 14, 2017","Best music app"
"June 20, 2014","I enjoy the different options offered me and in some cases a listing of songs hard to find elsewhere. I've only been a sub subscriber for a few days and am continue exploring what Spotify has to offer. The only regret I have at this point is that this service is not yet available on my windows phone, something I hope will change soon."
"March 30, 2015","I would have dropped out of college, fell asleep while driving, and been in severe road-rage-induced car accidents were it not for Spotify's nearly constant stream of music for me. Thank you Spotify. You're the best. Keep up the good work! Spotify also has great customer service for when you have any issues. I have been using Spotify Premium for over 4 years now. I recently had to use the free version for just a day or two while working through a problem I was having with my premium account and I realize why someone might not like it. There are definitely a lot of ads and a lot less freedom with the free version, but I believe the premium is worth it. If your'e a student anywhere, it's only $5 a month, and that's a lot less than a new CD. I love that it instantly syncs across all my devices so my playlists are with me in my car, work, my personal laptop, and even my phone. It's just great."
"July 26, 2016","Spotify is great! It is almost like Pandora only you can search and pick individual songs and make your own playlists. They don't have everything but they do have a lot. Also, the recordings for some of the songs are not good at all ( piano pieces are all I have heard so far with bad recording) but I don't know if Spotify controls that or not."
"October 3, 2016","We love Spotify. we have the family account and we are all always on it. Bluetooth it via the boat and our car. we all have such eclectic taste in music this is perfect rarely ever have ANY problems with Spotify and its amazing. :0) WE LOVE OUR SPOTIFY"
"December 30, 2014","I downloaded this app from the Amazon app store for my Kindle Fire HDX. At first it worked fine but then when I accessed it, it displayed a dialog box which said: APP COMPATIBILITY: Unfortunately, this app has not yet been updated to the latest compatibility or security standards. We have notified the developer and asked them to provide an updated version of this app. If you have any questions please notify our customer support team using the help app . Then it gave the options to either close or launch anyway. Considering the broad array of permissions that this app requires in any event,I chose to close it and will not be using it until it is cleared by Amazon. Wait a minute, they are the ones who ""sold"" it to me in the first place as an app approved for use on the Kindle. Confused yet? I am!"
"December 24, 2014","Love the versatility! Check this out. I live in Tucson, AZ and have been Care-giving for my 81 y o Father for the past 9 years out of my home. His health recently hit an all time low placing him into Home Hospice status. My Sister (49 y o) who lives in Charlotte, NC contacted her two sons (18 & 22 y o - my Fathers Grandsons) requesting they put together a playlist for my Dad including his favorite recording artists including but not limited too Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker, & Jethro Tull. They new this was a job to be done best by SPOTIFY. The Playlist was quickly assembled by the Grandsons, they e-mailed me (55 y o) my new created User Name & Password, I followed simple provided download directions. The Playlist appeared upon my Log-in I pressed Scramble Play, and I had one very happy, sick but smiling Father for the following 3.5 hours. Since yesterday he has enjoyed the mixed playlist 7 additional times and can't wait for tomorrow morning to come! Thank You Spotify!!!!!!!"
"January 30, 2017","Spotify is absolutely wonderful. I am in my 60's and really hate being exposed to do much of the electronic things. But my daughter thought I should have this and I am so grateful that she did. I have had so much fun getting all the old songs on a playlist (yes, and some new songs). I cannot praise you guys enough for such a user friendly program for all ages to enjoy. Thank you!!!"
"April 11, 2017","Well I have both Spotify and Pandora premiums. Spotify to me is way better though for several reasons. One, Pandora tends to skip alot and then instead of just pausing the song a second or two till it re-connects, it jumps to the next song. Gets rather annoying. Spotify on the other hand will pause, and then in a couple of seconds continue on with the same song. Two, I can choose playlists and download them if I know I'm going to be in a place where connection isn't very good. Pandora is good for suggesting songs based on your likes. I often use Pandora for that reason alone. But when it finds songs for me that I like, I add those songs to my Spotify playlists. Third, and for the kicker. I haven't used Pandora customer service so I can't judge them. But Spotify customer service is Aces. I was looking for a phone number to call them - which they don't have I found out, but that's okay. I used their contact form on their website and they contacted me back the very next day. The problem I was having was that my account got hacked and PW changed. Wouldn't have worried about it too much but I had my payment info, and of course playlists that I had taken lots of time to build. They immediately locked my account to where no one could access it, and deleted any personal & payment info. Then restored access to me. Not only that, they recovered all my playlists that had been deleted by this jackass whoever he/she/it may be (psyilucas@gmail.com). Anyway, several emails back n' forth with a badass rep named Christian over at Spotify, and I'm back to fully operational status!"
"February 29, 2016","Love spotify. All my favorite songs and albums at my fingertips. Really nothing bad to say about it. Its free and has ads but the ads dont bother me one ad after every few songs no big deal. Now it also lets you listen to one ad and have 30 minutes of uninterupted listening. I add my fave songs to playlists, organize playlists, and save entire albums. I just put my favorite playlist on shuffle and jam while im getting ready for work. It works great on my kindle fire. Excellent app."
"October 6, 2016","I would honestly give this platform five stars but, the adds are annoying. I don't want to upgrade lol. Great app though. They are always making good quality updates to music and over all stability of this app."
"June 21, 2014","I like that there is a huge amount of music available, that seems to make Spotify more likely to have the specific types I am interested in. I also like being able to search and find entire CDs of music and put them into an easily accessible list. Kind of like having CDs on my computer. I do wish that there was info on each CD or artist, or the lyrics, the way that Pandora does."
"August 27, 2017","My only complaint is that you need to have a membership to pick the order that your songs play on a playlist."
"April 20, 2017","I love it. It is the best music app made. I just don't know how to get premium plz tell me how too"
"November 3, 2017","I absolutely love Slotify. Not only can I create my own playlist of favorite music, but they put together suggested playlists based on my likes. I use Spotify every day to listen to music. Try it, you'll love it!"
"April 19, 2016","I really like spotify music app. Although I am relatively new to this app and will do a follow-up review once I have been using it longer. What is great so far is that the user can choose the music they want to hear! Unlike other music apps. What I am not sure of yet is can I as a mom of a pre-teen set parental controls that only I will be able to remove. There are some racy lyrics out there that I don't want my children exposed to just yet... including language or suggestive themes.so an update is in the future. As of this writing only I have used it and at that not long enough to vet it.."
"August 22, 2017","Comparing Spotify to what I consider its main competitor, Apple Music, there's really no clear winner. Both services have comparably sized music libraries, and each one has plenty of content that you won't find on the other. They're about the same price and have similar features such as radio stations (although Apple Music has stations with DJs if that's something you care about), hi-fi streaming, commercial free streaming, and so on. Apple Music's library appeals more to me personally, but the client absolutely does not.  The iTunes desktop client for Windows is nothing short of horrific, and they're pretty much equally inconvenient to use on Linux. I've found that they work about equally as well on OS X. You can login to Spotify on as many devices as you'd like, where Apple Music can only be authorized on six devices at once. You can't stream from multiple devices at once with either service. The Android clients for both services are great, although buffering time occasionally seems a bit longer than necessary on Apple Music. Obscure music is equally sparse on both services, but different bands are available for streaming on each of them, so it's worth looking into what they offer. I ultimately switched from Spotify to Apple Music because of that."
"June 24, 2017","This app will not let me start a playlist I can't even press the continue button to get started"
"August 6, 2016","They have great music and most of my favorite songs, I recently figured out that they don't have all of the panic! at the disco songs, and not all of a lot of other bands songs, I think they should work on getting all of a bands songs and not just half of them. Be sides that it is a great app"
"February 28, 2017","it is OK😎"
"September 6, 2016","To begin with, I discovered Spotify because I had a PS4 and Spotify apparently has some sort of partnership with Sony. I created an account through PlayStation for free and used it a few times but didn't realize the extent of its capabilities. I recently got myself a kindle fire, and have been using Spotify on it more than any other app! Not only can you stream any song you can think of for free, you can also create and listen to custom playlists, stations (similar to Pandora), and even listen to podcasts and videos! I use Spotify so much, and I would have to say its better than any other music app I've used by far. If you don't mind the 30 second ad every 30 minutes, you can pay $10 a month for premium and also get lots of other features. I would highly reccomend this app to anyone who loves music and wants it anywhere, anytime. This app absolutely justifies 5 stars!"
"April 7, 2016","Great love the songs 💕💞💖👼💘😋😝😚😜😘😎🙌#Famous #Kanye West  Love #Sit still look pretty #Daya"
"September 4, 2014","I downloaded the app originally and it worked, but then it started leasing up so I reinstalled it but now it won't install on the kindle fire. hopefully they can fix this bug."
"September 2, 2016","Okay so I highly recommend this is you love music cause like you find all your Fav songs and make a playlist and just.. relax and listen to it all its awesome I read and listen to my playlists on spotify I can't even express how amazing this app is just... download it for yourself and find out!!!! I LOVE THIS APP!!! :D also in. 16 so... If your a teen lookin for music and etc. This is soooooo for you!!! :3 :D"
"July 10, 2016","I probably should've known that is was too good to be true. For those of you who joined spotify early enough you may recall how similar in appearance the desktop app was when compared to itunes, so similar in fact, that you could easily have mistaken it for itunes, except all the music was free! Free has a cost though and 10$ a month for premium unlimited (when the equivalent will only buy you 10 songs from itunes, which btw has a limited number of downloads before you have to REBUY IT AGAIN) out weighs the competition pretty heavily.  Perhaps in a wise move, the Spotify management did away with the Apple itunes-esque design, and replaced it with pretty much the current design that we have today. Unfortunately, the new design took a few steps backwards from its original functionality, certain key features seem to be missing or lacking, and I personally found the old design to be more aesthetically pleasing if not simply easier to navigate.  Pros: -Free with ads, or 10$ monthly membership which is 1000% worth it! -Remarkably large volume of artists and music selection to satisfy the pickiest audiophiles. -Local syncing allows you to easily add any music from your personal collection on your PC onto your phone via wifi almost seamlessly.  Cons: -Programming team behind the app grows progressively ""dummer"" with each update, by which I mean they have a tendency for gutting out small quality-of-life features (like controlling title size in the desktop app). -Local syncing may require some ""massaging"" to get working at times, if you're not particularly tech savvy this can be a real dilemma. -Will eat through your phones internal storage in no time, however my provider (Virgin Mobile) offers unlimited music streaming and I get good enough coverage to never worry about buffering.  Conclusion: I'm very impressed with the quality of service I get from my 10$/mo premium and can't imagine living without it (throwback to the Limewire days anyone?). Some of the prior updates smoothed out the layout, but at the cost of functionality in some minor areas, but not enough for me to knock down a star. Having the ability to quickly and easily sync local mp3s to my phone without the same inclusive barriers that I've come to expect from Apple products feels like a God send! 5 out of 5, I highly recommend it!"
"September 2, 2017","Amazing app"
"September 16, 2017","Able to link current devices that has Spotify to use as a remote."
"March 20, 2017","Love the app. All of my music is on it!"
"February 4, 2016","Literally nothing wrong with it. Not having premium is not bad at all--I can still listen to all the music spotify provides, if I have wifi. And there's even a bonus, maybe only for my specific kindle: even though I don't have premium, i'm still allowed to select songs I want to play when I want to play them, instead of just playing shuffle and having no control over what's playing all the time. Occasionally, ads come a few seconds before the song is over, which is a little disrupting, but it's not really a problem. Good work, Spotify, keep it up. :)"
"February 15, 2016","LOVE LOVE LOVE Spotify. Even more so than Pandora. I purchased the commercial-free version and I use this app all the time, with ZERO COMPLAINTS! I get to pick my favorite songs and make my own playlists or I can like another's playlist or I can enjoy songs by only one artist-- the possibilities seem endless. Try the free version first and see if you like it, then upgrade-- that's what I did! :)  My playlists are under LEISADAVIS.ERA - check it out, you might like them!"
"November 29, 2016","I have tried Pandora... Jango... Sound Cloud... and quite a darn few other music apps... but Spotify had everything I was looking for... it is $10 ( ten ) for the premium version... I do not buy the premium. And it is still an incredible app... I absolutely love music, and this app has everything a music lover needs... Definitely a ""must have"" app."
"March 23, 2016","Could use a bit more variety with the ads. I don't mind ads, but I'd rather not hear the same ones over and over again. Lots of great music, and good playlists from Spotify."
"June 19, 2017","I love the app! It's amazing! Doesn't have all the music i listen to but still. Haas almost all of them. Recently helps with music"
"July 23, 2016","Love it it is amazing"
"May 23, 2016","I finally got this app to work on my new phone!! Previously I was unable to log-in and after repeated requests to reset my password, with the links never working, it seems there may have been some compatibility issue with my old phone. I've been doing a lot of song/artist searches and this is a bit annoying since I can't immediately tell if a song is legit or a cover till I download it. So a lot of deleting is going on. I'm also finding that the search engine is poorly designed since I can input a name or title and I may or may not find what I'm looking for. Very inconsistent. But, that being said, I still give this 4 stars since it's a great way to find new and old music and add to my library."
"September 22, 2014","You should take a minute to try this you will love it! It's free and you can save your music for offline play also. You can find your songs and artists easily. The application is SO easy to use that you will really enjoy it. You don't have to do a million things to play music on this site. It's free so give it a try. Enjoy! Thank you makers of SPOTIFY MUSIC !! You made this APP worth while."
"August 25, 2017","It's a pretty good app. The suggestions are way more appropriate to my likes/dislikes than Pandora managed. It is indeed spotty as far as internet connectivity (to their app alone; I could still reach the internet and other apps), and I spend half of my time on the app, waiting for it to load again. But I can create playlists, which is a step up from many sites; not just ""I like this band, play me their channel and similar songs/artists"", but outright putting songs in order on a listing, with the capability to shuffle.  As per usual with free radio sites, I couldn't find a few of the songs or artists I wanted, and annoyingly some songs only came as excerpts, like ""Lady of Shallot"", which has 5 versions on this site, none of which include the full song."
"October 19, 2017","I love Spotify so much. It feels me with joy. My fave playlists would be all the rap ones. I'm addicted to rap and I'm finding new music each and every day. When I'm having a bad day I just listen to music to drown my sorrow away. I definitely recommend spotify."
"January 18, 2017","Spotify is an amazing app if you are wanting to listen to music. You can set up your own playlists and organize them the way you please or listen to playlists Spotify has already created! They can give you song choices from songs you already listen to too, but! There's a tiny but. (haha) On most mobile devices, you can only listen to the music on shuffle, which is great when you don't know which song to choose or you just want to listen to it all, but it's not when there's one in particular that you want to hear. Other than that, amazing music app. So thankful I got it, it's helped me find some new amazing music that has become my favorite 😊"
"May 28, 2016","Nice selections"
"February 24, 2017","I love how I can listen to whatever song or artist I want and still have radio stations that at are based on what I listen too."
"December 24, 2014","Very good app with good browsing and discovery of music. The only issue that prevents me from giving 5 stars is that every so often it has trouble opening on the galaxy S5. I have to repeatedly open and close it, and sometimes wait a couple of minutes, for it to work."
"June 22, 2016","As my title indicates, Spotify is the best when it comes to ease of use, as well as, and most importantly, when it comes to the quantity and quality of the music! Also, it is well worth it, but not mandatory, to pay the paltry fee and ditch the commercials. :) Love my Spotify!"
"September 5, 2014","I was excited after a long time of waiting to get a legit version of Spotify on my 1st gen Fire. I had to watch two new models in the line release, and now that Spotify is finally on the Amazon store, you won't support my Fire in running it!? I bought the friggin extended warranty too! How much money do I have to give you before you will uphold your end of the deal?!"
"August 1, 2017","I absolutely love Spotify and I use it all the time. I have Spotify Premium and it definitely worth paying for it. I use it everyday some day and almost all hours of the day. I also love he offline mode so that if your not on wifi you can still listen to the playlist you choose. With Spotify premium, there's not ads, unlimited skips and you can listen to anything you want to. It's definitely the best source for music streaming. Thanks Spotify! 😄👏🏻"
"October 16, 2016","I'm not able to use the play/pause functionality unless I'm directly in the app, hopefully this gets fixed with the next update."
"June 6, 2017","My sons have been evangelizing about Spotify Premium for a while now, so I tried the free look and am hooked. I'll play an album and when it's done it will start playing music based on what I've played in the past. I must say their algorithms are pretty good and I've learned about a few new artists along the way. Well worth it."
"December 25, 2015","Spotify is the music app you NEED to have! Whether you use the free version or purchase Spotify premium, you will find hours upon hours of enjoyment with this app. You use Facebook to create an account, after which you can share your favorite tracks and playlists with friends. You can add any song you want to by saving the artist, album, or individual track. The music library is seemingly endless. I have found music from everywhere including the Philippines to Germany. I use the free version, which means I am limited to online use and using shuffle when I play playlists or artists. I will encounter ads every 30 minutes, after which I will have 30 minutes of ad-free music. By purchasing Spotify premium, you can save your playlists offline with no ads, higher quality music, and not having to listen on shuffle mode."
"July 20, 2014","I think SPOTIFY is the best music app in the world!!! Why should I get this though you ask, 1. Its toatally free 2. You can get any song in the whole wide world for free 3. Its partly a socail media so you can get followers and stuff based on how much other people like your playlists and songs 4.You can even listen to your playlist and songs offline!!! 5. Also there is remixs,explicit versions, clean versions, and all of that too! So if you still don't believe me try it for you self for FRRREEEEEE!!!!!!!"
"July 23, 2016","So much songs that at lit asf"
"September 7, 2015","This is a really great Spotify app for Kindle Fire that is even better than the web app in my opinion. You can easily access all of your options, and it plays clearly with very few issues. One of the issues is that if you have to pause your song for a little while, you often times come back to the app saying you are not connected online. I always check and am always connected. Clicking back until it kicks you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track. Also sometimes when playing for a long period of time, you will occasionally come across a song that will be buffering and will not play. I tend to just go back to my playlist or songlist and try another song. Other than that, I really like the app, and I find it to be the best out of all of the music apps (Pandora, IHeartRadio, etc.) out there."
"March 20, 2017","I love spotify because you can create your own playlist and you can listen to any music without purchasing it! Totally worth 5 stars!"
"August 4, 2017","I love everything about this app except for the simple fact that you can't play songs that u want to. I don't want to feel like the only way I can listen to a certain song that I want at the moment is that I HAVE to purchase the premium thing. I can understand that I would have to pay to download the songs, but to pick my own songs that I would like to listen to at the moment? That to me doesn't really seem right but I won't argue. Anyways, other than that, this app is amazing! (If anyone who does work behind this app, please update this and if possible make it so that we can choose our songs for free pls? Thanks~)"
"August 6, 2017","If you love a lot of songs and music, well this is the app for you!!!! It has so many songs. You can make ur own music playlist. It has some ads but they barley are on. Lol I suck at reviews. This also has radio. This is so much better than iHeartRadio😊"
"January 20, 2016","I love my spotify. I have the free version. I use it primarily when I'm working on my computer for music background or working out or working. When you get to listen to your own personal selection of music, you don't have to worry about turning the channel, or hoping the next song is better. They are all great songs, because it's your selection. You can make different lists too, which makes it even more customized for what you are doing and what you want to listen to while your are doing it."
"May 2, 2017","I can safely say that Spotify is the greatest, most joy-inducing invention of the 21st century. I play music CONSTANTLY and Spotify can satisfy your every need with a mere click of a button, from Yo-Yo Ma and Mozart to 60s folk to modern electronica... The premium version is the best $10 a month I can possibly spend. I wish I had a dollar for all the money I spent on cassettes and CDs back in the day, whew... I use this gloriois app, new releases to me within minutes of release, and member all the weeks waiting for CDs from the BMG CD club!!! Modern marvel..."
"December 5, 2014","Spotify is the solution for keeping your music selection relevant throughtout you life. Allowing you a full musical experience in a very cost effective manner. Music is the background of life keeping us present. Let me tell you a quick story. When in my car with a nephew one afternoon I realized my music collection was so stale and outdated. An indicator part of me was stuck in the past and holding on to something. Like many of us, I had spent a lot of money on everything from albums, 8 track, cassetts and CD over the years. At some point that investment switched from buying to storing music. The cost of holding on to the past prevented me from experience the present. And takes me back to the beginning of my story. So my solution to keeping life's background revelation in a cost effective manner is SPOTIFY. And Spotify Connect allows me to stream Spotify thought out the home"
"October 14, 2014","Been using SPOTIFY for about 2 1/2 years and has always been able to satisfy the only reason I could not give 5 stars is that it seems to lack one thing that a number of other streams provide and that is a sleep timer and/or alarm clock feature ...other than that it's really good at laying out the new releases discovery tracks, mood plays, had used a competitor for a bit of time and was happy with there genre/ subgenre UI layout but after some research on SPOTIFY found that it has its own app that does lay out those choices. So yeah may not give a wake up call or drift me off into a good slumber but would not choose it over any other....."
"February 14, 2017","As someone who grew up wth lovers of music in a house with music always playing, two sngers and even a tour manager for a great Indie/Folk musician in my family, I am so blessed to have been around every kind of music from every decade of the 20th and now 21st centuries (plus a love of Classical, film scores, Broadway standards, you name it. Spotify helps me access pretty much anything I am in the mood for. I have never searched for an artist or song and not found it in Spotify. It really is the coolest site. The App is great too, very easy to use, and I even discover new music here. Try it, I can't think of an problems or even disappointments, and have been a happy fan, especially in the lastt few years. IF you tried Spotify when it first was popping up on Facebook, and found it confusing (i did, but can't remember why, it has been been a while), I encourage you to give it another go. Everything is organized and user friendly, you can follow friends &learn about new - or just new to you- songs. My 78 year old Dad LOVES this App (he has a vinyl collection to die for, early Rock from the people who truly were the pioneers. And Spotify has it, they have the 1970s stuff my Mom digs and new discoveries she hears in radio. I only wish my music LOVING Grandmothers were around still, they both loved music so much. So yep, 5 stars from me, and my adventures into more than 80s music :( Which they also do have. 😀 the best ""Time Machine"") Sorry to gush, but I'm really happy to write about something positive! Download and HAVE FUN!! :0)"
"January 25, 2017","I can't even click on anything!!!!!!!!"
"July 24, 2017","I've been using Spotify for a few years, both the free version and subscription. I stopped the subscription because it was too expensive for the amount of time I actually used it, and now that I am back to the free version, I cannot play any songs I want when I use it on my phone app. It's always on shuffle, basically no control over my music and the ads are so annoying. I got the same skin disease ad all day over and over while sitting at my work computer - SO EMBARASSING. I downloaded VIBBIDI (free) and it is WAY better, I can actually choose the songs I want to listen to."
"July 10, 2014","Spotify is my favorite music app by far. It's great for playing almost anything you can think of. You can search by song, album, or artist. You can also search playlists that other users have created, or make your own. The discovery features are pretty ample. Spotify makes it's own suggestions, and there are several add-ons (last.fm, Hype Machine, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone Recommends, etc.) that also give great suggestions based on your listening habits or what's new and popular. The social element is also fun. You can follow other users (including artists) and see what they're listening to, and share songs and playlists. I pay for Spotify premium because I like having offline access and no ads!"
"November 22, 2016","THIS APP IS SO DAM CONFUSING!!!!!! I TRY TO PLAY A SONG AND IT WONT LET ME!!!!!!!! WARNING: DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS!!!!!!💔😬😬😬😬😤😤😤😤"
"June 28, 2016","I am loving spotfiy ! I can listen to any music I want! Between country, rock, wrap even upbeat music! If u are listening to music before its offline it works. I tested it when I was on a road trip! I give Spotify a 10 but can only rate it to a 5! Anyone looking for music should choose Spotify! However, it takes a few to login or syc to fb! Enjoy"
"December 28, 2014","Well for the longest I would use this app in the free version. On PC its the best program for me even in free version because you create unlimited playlists and skip as many times as you want only there was commercials. I recently upgraded to premium and it's 100x better. No more commercials and some features I don't use. I forgot to mention spotify on mobile only allows several skips a day. With premium it acts just like on the pc. No commercials unlimited skips and you can also pick a song from your playlist and will play any song you choose. I personally liked the free version over Pandora for the simple fact that I could make a playlist on Spotify and play it on my phone but would be on random or &#34;shuffle&#34;. And now I just like the fact that I can now fully listen to my music and not be annoyed with commercials or no more skips allowed."
"July 23, 2016","THIS APP IS THE BEST I LOVE ALL THE NEWEST HIT YAYYYYY"
"August 16, 2017","All genres, all the time. From way back when to now. Pulls up songs I have even forgot about. I love going out to a restaurant or just out for a cocktail I Shazam and it pulls up my Spotify to and add into my library. Get the family plan and save money! My grand kids have their own Library on my phone. Anywhere we go were hooked up to Spotify jammin, singing and dancing! Just haven tons of fun. Husband and I love our Spotify!"
"April 3, 2017","Awesome awsome"
"August 30, 2014","The application will download and will not install on my kindle fire. It does not give any explaination, it pops up a dialog box that says it cannot be installed."
"July 17, 2016","i like Spotify a lot - BUT - it has a lot of glitches. When i'm putting songs into categories or playlists, sometimes it switches to the Playlist i'm working on - if i stay on it a second too long. THEN when i go back to the Song List - it jumps up to the top of it (to the A's) and i have to find where i was before. This happens a LOT and it's VERY annoying.  I have found many 'songs' on Spotify that i have been looking for for a long time - so that is Great!! The Classical lists are very good as i have found Augustin Hadelich whom i absolutely love. It has music from the early 1900's - the 20's, 30's, 40's. i have found most of the music i really love - BUT i can't find any good stuff of Bob Seger's or solo by Eric Burdon which he has done lately. i am frustrated over that.  Spotify sound is fantastic even on my Macbook and iPhone regular speakers.  I am really looking forward to getting the glitches fixed - and i still love iTunes (i'm sentimental :)"
"August 26, 2014","I would love this to work on my kindle fire 1st gen but it keeps telling me it can't be installed. don't think it is me have downloaded other apps and they work just fine."
"September 2, 2017","It's really fun but u have to get the primary to listen to music any where"
"September 8, 2014","I have this APP on my ipphone and it works great. but it will not install on my kindle fire. i hope there isnt a compatibility issue between spotify and kindles"
"June 12, 2015","I got premium a month or so ago and loved the freedoms that came with it. I bought that month with a card from the store. Now I wish to get another month, but I don't have a credit card and was trying to see if I didn't have to go to the store for a card again. Five stars if it would allow me to pay through Amazon. The free trial is alright. You can get a bunch of music and create playlists. An ad comes up about every half hour. Not too shabby."
"October 19, 2017","With Spotify, I've been able to customize my listening more than I ever could with Pandora- Creating playlists, listening to your favorite album of that one artist you love, so much more! It aswell has similar channels in some parts to what you would find on Pandora, so trust me when I say you won't be missing much of anything!"
"August 11, 2017","First of all, I've been a loyal premium user (student subscription) for the last two years. I thoroughly enjoyed the desktop and mobile versions, as well the other features provided - offline streaming, Discover station etc.  However, beware of Spotify's horrible customer service and other difficulties when using internationally. First, I noticed that I was being charged a full price subscription ($9.99) for several months despite still being a student. The automated email response by Spotify's customer service stated that the student subscription is only valid for 12 months/academic year, and must afterwards be manually renewed. There was NO prior warning for this and I was charged $30 more, without the possibility of a refund - DESPITE still being a student. I even suggested that the extra charges be put towards future subscription payments and they refused.  Second, good luck using Spotify conveniently abroad. If you wish to change your method of payment while abroad, your credit card MUST match the country you are in - which is incredibly inconvenient for most users and those who frequently travel. Spotify does not offer advance-payments (i.e. 3 months or more) so this problem is difficult to avoid. Customer service is horrendously slow (24+ hours to receive an automated email response) and in most cases my question was not even addressed properly."
"September 15, 2017","I can listen to lit music and make a playlist, but you have two upgrade for downloading music."
"July 13, 2017","I have been using Spotify for years now and I am in love with it. I used to have problems trying to find all kinds of free music downloader apps and apps like pandora... but Spotify really has it all! It is your one stop shop for endless playback, new music, radio options, while being able to follow artists and your friends. I highly recommend this app if you are an avid music listener, you like finding random music, or for just about anyone else out there. It has something for all!!!"
"September 13, 2016","I love this!!! I can find almost any song I like and play it whenever I want. So much better that Pandora where you cannot pick the exact song you want. And it's free!!! I just can't listen without internet without paying. That's fine by me. I let this play whenever I'm cleaning. I can skip songs if I'm not in the mood for them, but usually I just let my song list play. I picked the songs, so I like every song that comes up"
"March 16, 2017","I love this app so much. I am a premium member and I can create and play my playlists anytime I want. This is the best app I have found yet, and I've tried many! The only downside for me is I couldn't find 2 songs and I'm not sure why. I'm not taking a star off for it tho."
"February 8, 2017","Spotify is new to me and I have found it to be pretty cool. A nice feature being that you can keep it playing while reading or other apps. are going on your Kindle. Great streaming service and a good way to check out new albums before you purchase them on Amazon or other places. It is a free app. , so give it a shot! I find the search feature best."
"November 9, 2016","There are many apps that allow users “free” access to music but it usually comes at the price of extensive advertisement interruptions or limited streaming capabilities. The Spotify app combines inexpensive buy-in with user-friendly layout to make it worth spending a few dollars a month on a music streaming app.  In terms of a free app, the Spotify app limits users in that they cannot stream music without Wi-Fi. Once the user decides to pay for the Premium version of the application, these restrictions no longer apply and the app becomes the perfect suite for music discovery and library curating. For this review, I will be assessing Premium Spotify and not the free version of the app.  The cost for students is very affordable with a discount bringing the original price of $9.99 down to $5.99. Although for some this may seem pricey, access to unlimited music means one only needs to add 5 songs a month to reach the price per song threshold that surpasses the value of the iTunes store which charges $1.29 per song. Many will add more than this amount in new music a month and will find that it is much more affordable than other means of purchasing music and is available without Wi-Fi and without using one’s data plan if saved to a specific playlist.  This is more efficient, affordable, and legal than the means available for music streaming in the past. Free applications such as Limewire or its predecessor Frostwire were based on a system of file sharing that was shaky in its legality and often led to viruses being downloaded onto one’s computer. Many of the songs were incompatible file types for iTunes which made it difficult to access music on cell phones or media players. Spotify makes it easy to access your music library by allowing integration with iTunes libraries and having cross-platform apps that can be installed on a variety of devices.  Spotify has over 30 million songs in its catalog and adds around 20,000 songs each day. One still may not be able to find songs that may be readily available on applications like Soundcloud. In comparison to apps like Pandora Spotify also falls short because often times the music it chooses to match songs of your choice are either by the same artist, or are characteristically exactly the same as the selected song and offer no variety. Looking for new music often falls upon the user to search and sort through the vast catalog of music on their own.  All in all, Spotify remains my top choice for music streaming based purely on its low price and extensive catalog. Supplementing Spotify with free apps like Soundcloud and Pandora work well to complement Spotify in the areas where it falls a little short. Even with its shortcomings, the price, music catalog, user friendly layout, and compatibility with multiple devices make it the best choice for music streaming."
"October 10, 2017","Music streaming websites offer the basic functions for easily accessing music, and out of all of them, Spotify is one of the top competitors. The company goes above and beyond to cater to their clients’ musical needs by providing a wide selection of music, creating personalized playlists and notifying them of recent activities for their favorite artists. These advantages not only allow a user to discover new music based on their personal taste but also gives a quick shortcut to make it convenient for them. With the regular updates on artists recent activities users are able to listen to their newest tracks as soon as they are released or even have the opportunity to attend their latest show. As far as the search goes for the best compatibility between a music streaming service and music lovers, Spotify is a great service to try out, especially since they do offer free trials."

"February 23, 2015","Trust me on this one, This is the best music app I ever seen! & you can even make a song playlist and make it so people can look at them and follow the playlist then....YOU! (but that is only when if you make it public)And if your wondering what my profile is it's optical music and my old account is vikame anyways it has alot of song and I mean ALOT!!! You can find over 1,000,000 records/tracks and I'm not lying!You can also share your playlist and you can even save songs that you like by touching a song and then touch the plus sign.There is a lot of different music genres like Rap,Country,Deep Web,R&B, And Emo but emo sucks so dont listen to it or you will kill yourself but I highly Recommend this app.SPOTIFY IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN PANDORA!!"
"April 4, 2015","I found this app on a vacation in France, after Pandora told me I couldn't use out in Europe. Unlike leading music apps/radios, you can create playlists, listen to already made playlists, or, my favorite, just search up particular songs, artists, or genres. Usually, on Pandora our iHeart radio, you just listen to whatever is on a certain radio of your choice. After using this app, I have found absolutely every song I've looked for but one. It works great, but like all others, needs Wi-Fi or cell service. But it's still totally worth it. 5 stars!!!"
"December 18, 2014","If you like the ~1 million track library Prime Music now has you should try out Spotify and its ~30 million tracks of music. It's like trying to drink from a fire hose, but eventually you'll learn how to explore and you'll never have to listen to just a small library of purchased tracks again!  The interface is well designed and easy to use. It's almost exactly like it's Android version so no real Fire tablet/phone extras, but still well done. Be sure to go to settings and bump up streaming quality as high as you can with your data plan."
"October 13, 2016","I will never go to another music program. Spotify has me for life wether I have the free program or if I'm fortunate enough to have Premium Spotify has me for life."
"July 24, 2017","I listen to the music 2047 it's helps me go to sleep wake up and (don't mind the spaces) its AMAZING!!!!!! :) thanks for reading!!"
"August 26, 2016","Spotify (free version) has all Pros: choice of music, ease of use, dependabilty, availability of current + vintage genres & songs, transportability (downloads across multiple platforms)...to name a few. Cons: none that I have found & at this rate will be surprised if I do. I would get it again & do recommend it to all my music lovers. Thank YOU Spotify for being awesome!"
"October 4, 2017","Love this app. I have tried different music apps, but this is user friendly in my book, and can download, so can be offline and listen anywhere. Has a huge selection of music, which is great, since I listen a lot to german music, and no problem finding it."
"November 28, 2014","Thank you, thank you, thank you for fixing the Spotify app!  I uploaded it as soon as I got my Kindle Fire back in January. Unfortunately it didn't work at all. I couldn't access my playlists, it wouldn't play more than one song, and it continued to freeze until I finally deleted it.  Tried again a few weeks back and I'm overjoyed. Now I can stream all my Kansas, Vanilla Ice, Neil Diamond, and Miranda Lambert happily."
"August 4, 2017","This is not only the best music app on the market, it could very well be the best app on the market.  Premium is absolutely worth it.  As a musician, I cannot live without this.  What are you waiting for, download this and improve your life."
"July 31, 2014","If there were more stars, I would give to SPOTIFY. Masterworks Broadway got me started with their playlists. I like being able to select an artist, listen to an album, switch to radio for Spotify to make suggestions based on what I was listening to. The fee audio is excellent. I haven't tried the premium, yet. Only because I really like the music ads. I've been introduced to a number of good artists from the ads. Besides, the ads aren't that frequent and only 30 seconds long. Once over, you back listening to your music. I really can not say e enough good things about SPOTIFY. I've been recommending it to my friends on Facebook."
"October 8, 2017","Spotify is incredible in every way imaginable... Lol, how often does one feel like the they're personally cared about naturally? Spotify gives me that feeling.... Having a premium account is one of the few monthly payments ive ever had in life that I've not had one regret about, and I got three months for free lmbo.  Keep it up Spotify... You've got my musical heart... (Discover weekly slays pandora's lame attempts)"
"August 14, 2017","Spotify is a fantastic service with great music content. I have used it for about 2-3 years now and recently i have upgraded to premium to take away the ads (which are always funny and interesting) the only problem i have ever had with it is sometimes if you have your library saved offline to your phone it will un install all the songs forcing you to redownload them. Now this may only be a bug, and it has only happened to me twice in the past 6 months but it is kind of a pain. If they patch that bug then i will gladly give a 5 start review."
"April 7, 2016","I love Spotify, any song or CD I want to &#34;own&#34; is mine, just by searching for it and then saving it. It will always be there. Same goes with any othe playlists I create. I still need to figure out how the folder system works and though I have the free version on my tablet the interruptions from ads are minimal. I think $9.99 a month is a little over priced, since I could get Prime with all that comes with it for under $100. But I will want to download eventually, so when I'm not so broke, I'll be investing in it."
"August 8, 2017","I love Spotify! I have their premium service and I can listen to music offline, I don't have any commercials and I can skip around as much as I like. I don't even need to try any of the other streaming services because Spotify has exactly what I need."
"September 10, 2016","I really would have given four stars to this had there been no ads. This is exactly the reason why I went from ""regular"" TV to Roku. I'm sick of the commercials. I like that you are able to create playlists on Spotify so have been having fun with that. Also the ""browse"" feature is nice if you know who the artist is but forget the name of the song. All in all, it's pretty good and I would recommend to all music lovers."
"August 8, 2017","I love this app. I can pick all of the songs i love unlike pandora that picks songs based on what you like."
"October 15, 2017","I created a calm jazz playlist last night, and fell asleep to it. Beautiful!! My son and daughter used Spotify to create the playlist for their sister's wedding. We linked it to our Church's PA and voila! Beautiful wedding. Great product!"
"September 10, 2015","The bug that has recently happened to me and I'm not sure if it's happened to anyone else or not but I got home one day and was about to start listening to five finger death punch... but it wouldn't let me play any music unless it was on shuffle or I had spotify premium... I'm able to listen to music now because I'm using the 7 days free feature of premium... if they could fix that I'm sure a lot of people would be happier."
"August 8, 2017","Amazing. Has just about, very nearly every song and album ever recorded. Allows you to create and organize playlists of any type and length. Just phenomenal. Can't live without it, in all honesty! ;) Works well on computer, phone, and tablet."
"August 22, 2015","Spotify sleeping music choices are amazing, and have a better selection than all of the sound machines I have ever owned. The other music and video shorts are great as well. The navigation setup is easy, and it all interfaces well with my Samsung, whi h is unusual. I am not inthe iworld, and often let down by the &#34;made for android&#34; apps. This was NOT disappointment. :)"
"June 12, 2017","I enjoy the wide variety of music that is available on Spotify. However I do not care for all of the extra phone that they call recommended. When I make a playlist I want it to play those songs not whatever it wants that they think is similar to those songs."
"July 12, 2017","I love this app...I get to listen to my favorite music"
"August 8, 2017","The great thing about Spotify is that you can play it on multiple devices, create playlists, easily find artists you like, or listen to curations / playlists put together by others. One of the best players around if you are an audiophile."
"November 14, 2014","Like most of these type of apps the free version is great as long as you have Wi-Fi, but I live in the rurals and am often in areas wIth no connection. Then the app is useless, as well as at work, which is a government secured Wi-Fi, again useless. If I want to use offline I have to pay $10 per month, that's $120 a year. I'm already paying for Prime and I get free movies, t.v., books, and shipping as well as the music for $99 a year. So, why would I pay for this or anyone for that matter?"
"December 6, 2016","Thank you for the app huge thank you now all I gotta say is LETS GET IT"
"October 26, 2015","I have had this for so long and it is amazing. I'm pretty sure everyone likes music so GET THIS! Free songs. If you get spotify premium you can listen ANYWHERE. Premium is only 10 bucks a month! For FREE SONGS! AMZING APP. LOVE IT!!!!!!! I would choose it over any music app other than Pandora they are both in first place. Cause with Pandora, I can find new songs to put on spotify!!! I also really recommend Pandora to spiritual lovers. ;&#62;"
"July 18, 2017","I have been a Spotify premium customer for several years. I love the ability to download albums or songs and play them back without using any data on my phone. Radio stations give you access to similar music to your favorite groups. Best $9.99 I spend monthly!!"
"July 18, 2017","I love it!! Get to listen to all my music whenever and wherever I want"
"July 30, 2015","I love this app but the new update makes the colors look bad they should go back but it is more efficient I guess. but you have to have wifi or you have to pay like 3.00 a month or something. but it's nice for if you have wifi. although the adds get annoying but I guess they have to make money somehow I mean they have to keep going an it's not like other apps there are song for all types of music New and old you just have to search."
"October 28, 2017","I prefer Rhapsody, where the available songs are pretty much the same, but the menus are much better organized and the privacy options seem more private, where Spotify seems designed to encourage you to make your online music experience more public. Although you can use Spotify for free if you don't mind the ads, while Rhapsody doesn't offer a free version beyond an initial trial period."
"November 17, 2016","I love this app and I'd give it 5 easily. Except for the last 6 hours or so I've been unable to use it. Claims its experiencing problems. Ive even uninstalled and reinstalled it. Started when my WiFi cut out. I don't know what to do but I hope it clears up soon. I'm on a fire tablet and I'm NOT the most tech savy. Is anyone else experiencing this? I love that it creates radio stations based on your tastes. I love making playlists of what I like. And the service is free on my cell phone companies data plan. So all in all this app is awesome. Ive enjoyed its use faithfully for a long while. I only wished it had a alarm or a sleep thing on it. That'd be my only suggestion."
"September 4, 2016","Best streaming service yet. Like that I can play full albums from bands. Pandora isn't even in the same category... I like to chose what I'm listening to, and sometimes even want to hear a specific song... imagine that. Spotify does that, and also has a huge number of 'radio' and playlists available if you don't feel like choosing everything."
"November 29, 2016","I really like this app and at the moment I am looking at christmas playlists and it is awesome I found some really good ones you should also go on and get several playlists before you start listening bc when I first got it I was listening to the same music over and over again and forgot that I can look for other music! REALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"
"March 27, 2017","I just love it! Beats all other streaming music providers I've tried. I don't mind paying for the quality I get. Especially since I can download my many, many playlists and always have my jams without using my data when in a bad service area or no wifi access."
"February 26, 2017","It's a pretty good app I just wish that I could look up a song with the lyrics instead of just the title cause sometimes you can forget the title"
"July 19, 2017","i found spotify because pandora locked up and i started reading the reviews 5 out of 10 people said screw pandora go spotify i tryed it love it i also like pandora im a big boy can have both yes if you cant find something to listen to for free with those two start singing in the shower i will never pay for music when you can get it free it is a shame that two componys as big as they are cant give all there customers the best that they can they call it pemium i call it a monthly bill o yea i told my friend pandora locked up on me she said take it out then put it back it came back pandora premium i dont know why but it was alot better to me than the free pandora i said somthing about it on a pandora ad on fasebook my acount was switched back to the freepandora within a couple of hours i could almost taste the anger no telling what they going to do now ROCK ON"
"October 29, 2015","I'm actually really annoyed that I keep having to thumbs down the same exact songs every couple of days. It only saves about 5 songs that I've thumbs-up or down. I'm so over hearing Adel. It's also a major bummer that it saves the thumbs down when it's an accident, and there's no way to correct it. The screen when listening to a station on the computer is odd. Way too busy. I'd rather it looked like it does when I'm on my phone; simple with the album artwork, artist and song title and time elapsed on song."
"May 31, 2017","Spotify let's me go quickly to all my favorite songs and artists. You can create playlists that you can easily get to. You can't listen to music on the go with connection but, you can simply download it on Spotify to let you listen. I enjoy skating and dancing to Spotify. It's simply a great app you must get it."
"May 20, 2017","I'm glad I can access Spotify on my Fire Tablet, I used to listen to it all the time at my old job. The quality is just like using it on a web browser, maybe with a few more ads here and there but nothing to complain about."
"September 11, 2016","It is a great app. Has great tunes. And if you pay the subscription fee you have as many skips as you like, no commercials and you can download tunes, albums and playlists. They have a wide variety of albums ."
"August 7, 2016","I love Spotify Music. You can pick the tunes you like, unlike Pandora. I just have the free kind, but I am going to pony up to premium so I can listen offline too. Try it, you've got nothing to lose and great music to listen to."
"July 17, 2017","Love it all I have to say it's amazing"
"January 8, 2015","Spotify is absolutely amazing. I got tired of my other music apps fast. I was constantly buying songs that I regretted within a few days of listening. But with Spotify, there's plenty of music to choose from and content for everyone. And I loved it so much without premium, but premium is even better. Not only can you skip songs, but you have a bunch of good music available at your fingertips. Get this app, I'd recommend it to anyone, because it suits everyone."
"July 12, 2016","Works well! Offers offline capabilities. Streams smoothly and offers a great selection of bands, albums and songs to chose from... Just waiting for FREE connect to my Roku.  Come out with THAT and you'll get 5 stars from me"
"September 1, 2017","It's quite slow until it 'warms up'! They really need to perform an update on this! It takes a while for your songs, playlists and albums to download and are ready to be played. Amazon apps are not up to MAJOR tasks!"
"November 30, 2015","The very best music app I've ever used! Remember when you listened to exactly what you wanted? I love searching for the perfect song, or that album I haven't heard since I was a teenager. Then there are the times I just select one of countless compilations/artist/playlist and enjoy. The only learning curve is the many search and save options.....but that is why you will love it. The free version makes me wonder who would need to pay for more. I prefer streaming to downloading!"
"April 6, 2015","Spotify has revolutionized the exposure to music in my life. I have virtually unlimited access to the music of this world here, can make my own mixes and listen to it on ALL my devices. Perhaps my favorite feature is the recommendations based on what I typically listen to. I have found several artists that I adore and probably would have never known about had not it been for Spotify. Thank you thank you thank you!"
"November 23, 2014","After using this app for a year or so and loving it on my walks and work-outs, I finally caved in and went add-free. I am impressed! As we speak I am listening to Coffee Table Jazz -- which is one of the many Jazz and Blues stations. Anything you want you can find, whatever suits the mood. I'm sure I'm not using it to its fullest yet, so this gives me a whole new world of music to explore. Love it so far. (I haven't tried using it offline yet, but this was one of the main reasons I went Premium.)"
"August 13, 2017","So far I love it better than any other music app I have downloaded more freedom to pick the bands I love using the free app right now probably worn upgrade still a great app highly recommend"
"August 16, 2015","Why is spotify better then all of the other music apps? Keep in mind just like every other music app if you want unlimited anything you have to pay a price. Spotify is 99 cents for the first 3 months and then 99 cents for each additional month(cheapest out of them all) ●offline listing ●make your own play lists ●unlimited skips ●share play lists with friends ●good suggestions but not alot (it's not annoying ● if the Playlist says g-eazy they are actually going to play g-eazy. Not iggy isalias. ●Multiple playlists ●with premium you can look up a whole library of music by search word (ex: country hits or Katy perry) and you can look through a already made Playlist or albums upon albums of music and you can play whatever you choose. Personally I was a Pandora person but a friend forced me to use it for a week and once you build up your Playlist with the music you like you will forget about Pandora or whatever you currently use. Also spotify graciously gives you a week free of premium use which will help you build your Playlist (although if you want to add a song to your Playlist you can just look it up spacificallly and hit the 3 dots on the right and hit the plus) So my overall advice for this app is try it out for a few days do the free trial and enjoy. You don't need premium to enjoy this app. Ads are reasonable not annoying"
"June 29, 2015","Very comprehensive app for listening to most all of your favorite artists. The 'free' version works well, with commercials at decent intervals. Sound quality is very good on my Kindle Fire HD, Not the same for PC. Music rarely plays without hesitation and pauses. The premium version has a real plus, off-line listening. That is albums can be downloaded to a phone or tablet and enjoyed without WI-FI or airtime. I understand that music downloads are not transferable to a PC library or other memory. If the $9.99/ mo. premium service is cancelled, so are the downloads. As much as I like Spotfy, it has a real drawback in that the music sampled or listened to stays in a history that loads every time you activate. There is no way to delete music that you don't want to keep. That is annoying and will quickly consume memory on a phone or tablet. So close to perfect, but NOT."
"January 8, 2016","This app has changed how I use my Kindle Fire. I basically only download apps that are free and broadly used, and Spotify is simply the best of the best. Spotify lets you try a week of their premium version free without asking nosy and annoying questions. Use the app to discover new and old music, it is so much fun. Although their library is not necessarily universally inclusive, the music quality is quite excellent and the software is easy to navigate I like to make my own playlists and also just to play specific artists' large backlogs on Shuffle. Highly recommended, this will probably be your most used app - yes, even the free version. I am so glad they made a version for Kindle Fire."
"June 8, 2016","Don't waste time and money with any other music playing app. Does everything that Pandora does, apple music and more. Plus the interface looks cool. If you are a student, make sure you look for the student discount which was 50% of for me."
"April 20, 2016","I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon for my music. I think Spotify's algorithm will suit more people who may have slower speed internet access. Spotify also appears to use an automatic gain control, limiter, and compressor in its audio chain. The ""loudness"" is consistent. That is not the case with Pandora as volume levels tend to go and down."
"April 21, 2016","Love Spotify more than any other music player thing out there. It's also way less expensive than other players and I can listen to pretty much anything I want, anytime I want. I love that and I don't have to listen to it in a station or anything like that. I can make my own playlists, which I love even more. I just can't say enough good things about this player. I love it so much!"
"November 30, 2014","Alongside with the Spotify Premium service ($10/mo.), this app compliments to the smart music lover who subscribes to the Spotify Premium service who loves to take his/her music on the go with synchronisation features for offline play for playlists. I listen to music using Spotify over other music players on my device and my playlists customised with a lot of songs on it have been downloaded so that I can just bring my phone and go listen in my car or just while I'm out there.  Great for the music listener and best for those who are also subscribed to Spotify Premium!"
"October 22, 2017","Cuts out suddenly after listening for a long period of time but overall its fine"
"October 20, 2017","This App Is Amazing,My Favorite Music Is All Here,Exept For Some Covers That I Really Like-Kellin Quinns cover of Iris-The Goo Goo Dolls,Twenty one pilots' cover of Can't Help Falling In Love-elvis presley,Otherwise Amazing Job This Is Great Music Saved My Life Multiple Times And It's Great To Have It All Here! #stopgnotingeveryonepleasespotifyithurtsourheartsthankyouforlisteningnowbacktoyourregularlyschedluledprogram ... T_T (so many g notes...so many)"
"May 15, 2017","I was using Pandora but for some reason started having problems accessing it so I decided to try Spotify. I'm really pleased with how many more songs there are with each artist, I prefer this to Pandora."
"October 13, 2017","It's got that Android thing going for it: Don't just play what I tell you to, do what I need you to do."
"August 29, 2017","The app froze on a Geico commercial so I deleted it from my device. A Geico insurance commercial...so random. It had been working wonderfully up until then. Oh well, good thing it's free...nothing lost."
"June 16, 2017","I love this app for music. You can make playlists with your favorite songs so they are easy to find and you don't even need to buy premium. You can play any song and they constantly update their songs and podcasts. It is easy to use and great if music is your life, like me. 😊"
"September 12, 2016","Ok, so I heard that Dan Howell has Spotify so I got it and I love it. #Phan :D But, it is really great! Do reccomend! I really cant spell. LOLZOR!!! Sorry,Dan. And sorry to everyone for having to read this."
"April 15, 2017","needs to be able to let two people play at the same time in same house"
"January 27, 2016","Overall it is an amazing program. I would say that it is the best of its kind. The most annoying part of it for me is that I think that they play more advertisements than necessary. I know the advertisements are in part to support all of us who listen for free, but it still seems like they play more than they need too. Usually I use it on my kindle and this brings me to my biggest problem with it. If you have the program open in the background while reading sometimes the music will just stop after the advertisement plays. Then use have to open Spotify back up and restart the player this can be incredibly annoying. Sometimes i will have to do it every 10 minutes.  Now that i gave the bad I will let you in on the good. Spotify has an incredible library of music to listen to and it spans across all genres. To go even further though they have full discography's of all sorts of Indie/Underground bands that you may have never heard of. Spotify is a great program and I truly believe that any music fan would love it so give it a try. Now i know that this review may seem negative, but I just want to add its only program I will use for music like this. I wanted to give it 4 in a half stars but since i couldn't I gave it 5 because it is way closer to 5 stars than 4. Please give it a try!"
"June 10, 2017","I am probably not your typical Spotify user. My taste in music is eclectic and focused on classical music. With Spotify I can find the music I want and suggested playlists for my mood and occasion. It is well worth the money."
"May 7, 2017","I am so glad I decided to get spotify. It is a great addition to my music collection. I just love it."
"August 12, 2017","Spotty continues to have weak assed limits on downloads and songs you can save. Downloads continue to randomly disappear, forcing people to have to download again and again (a process that takes ages if you have lots of tracks). Also, they are lousy at updating new music sections for less popular genres (e.g., Reggae). It has other functionality issues, too. All of them seem eminently fixable, yet they're never fixed."
"September 5, 2017","This app is super cool, the only thing that I don't really like about it is that if you have a kindle when ur on a road trip or something, and there's no WiFi, Spotify won't work and u can't playt any songs! \: But other that that this app is amazing!! It loads quick and has any type of song, and it picks songs for you based on what u listen to!! ((:"
"June 25, 2014","I dont like the Kindle Fire app, because the only thing i can do is listen to music in shuffle. So i tried pc version and it's absolutely baller good, you can listen to music every way you want and when you want. Shuffle, repeat or normally. I recommend this for PC (using Windows 7 dont know how world for Mac users)"
"November 7, 2017","This is currently my favorite app in existence. Worth the monthly fee for all the music. Instead of buying a CD per month, I get access to 30 million songs. Win!"
"August 11, 2017","this is such a joy to listen too. I love how I can make my own station playlist but that they have a playlist of the week as well based off what I like to listen to."
"September 24, 2017","An amazing way to listen to music."
"March 9, 2017","Spirit is AWESOME! On the computer. On your phone you are very limited in what you do. Like, you can not choose the song you want. You can only push shuffle play. And some times it chooses a different song that is in your playlist. A positive it is will warn you that the song is explicit. Very nice. Refined it highly because every single song is on it."
"June 9, 2017","This app works exactly like the desktop version and allows you to do everthing that you would with the pc version of the software. The offline function works like it should. I would remcomend this app to anybody that needs the spotify app to be abble to login to there spotify acount. I love the prenium option of being able to put music offline. It is like having an MP3 with all the music you can possibly think of. AMAZING service."
"May 12, 2017","I love love Spotify so much I use it everyday and if your looking a music app this app if for you !☺"
"January 14, 2016","Works perfectly with my kindle fire hd 7. Yes it's the FREE version but with this version you can ""shuffle play"" channels and stations or artist related music which may include similar style songs from other artists but overall I really enjoy this app. Have not had any buffering issues over my wifi. Music selections, styles, genre, are plentiful. Enjoy!"
"May 3, 2016","Sorry, I d made the decision by mistake. I love Spotify so much I use it as a sleep aid or to help me relax after a rough work day. I love the choices offered plus u can customize the music based on personal moods. It s one of my favorite apps."
"March 23, 2017","A few months ago, I subscribed my daughter to Spotify Premium, taking advantage of a $0.99-for-3-month deal. Everthing went through on the website. Spotify then decided that my daughter was not eligible for the deal just because I paid with the same credit card as my own Spotify Premium account. And without telling me, Spotify charges my daughter the full price of AUD11.99 per month for 3 months. I contacted Spotify and they will only offer one month's refund as a ""one-off courtesy"". So, Spotify charged me without my authorisation; would only offer a part refund and make it sounds like they doing me a big favour. So, I told Spotify: give me full refund or else don't bother!  Be very careful of these Spotify deals - they are unscrupulous."
"October 9, 2017","I love this app I can put it on any device I want and still have my playlists anyplace I want to. runs just s well on my tablet as it does on my computer."
"April 25, 2016","""SPOTIFY"" I am 66 years old and I have listened to a lot of music on many devices and by far the ""SPOTIFY STREAMING"" app ROCKS! It's great listening again to the music I grew up with! Thank You ""SPOTIFY! Dave Carlson TH, MN"
"July 9, 2017","I love it so much but don't get pinterest my mom accidentally logged me out one day we tried to find the password but we couldn't because all you can see is little dots so we had to recreate my board full of about 2 million pins I had had that board since the first grade and now I'm in fifth grade. Pinterest does not give you a password at all."
"August 23, 2017","What can I say...it's Spotify. I think it's the best app for music. The only issue you'll have is if you don't download your playlist, and you lose cell reception."
"December 28, 2015","My kids love this and the awesome selection for younger children (kids bop galore)... We've only had a few crashes. I do wish I could have more than one profile under the same acct so I didnt have to use multiple emails (maybe it is possible and I just havent discovered it yet!)."
"June 19, 2017","Now picking your own music to listen to is the perfect radio station wouldn't you say? Albums, varius artists, intrnational music anything you want!!! What more could you ask for. Talk about being your own D J"
"September 11, 2015","It does not get any better then Spotify, Fact. It has every single song or artist I have ever searched for, unlimited listening and what seems like a never ending artist list, No glitches, easy and fun (believe it or not) to navigate and I enjoy their ever-growing Playlist much more then I would have thought and there's a-figgin'-lot. In fact It's almost too much at times because I find myself searching things more then listening😂 but I am not complaining because I have discovered so many artist I probably would have never stumbled across without. I have spent more hours on this app then any other. Thank you Spotify, your app bettered my life👏💗🎶💋"
"September 28, 2014","This app is incredible, and I highly recommend getting Premium as well. For 10 dollars a month you never need to buy another song again. That being said, I was heartbroken because I could not find my favorite song of all time: ""Starlight"" by Don Diablo and Matt Nash. This crushed me enough to give it a four star review. If you're into ultra-obscure music like me, this might not be the app for you. Give it a try, though. It's free!"
"April 19, 2016","Good service but difficult to navigate for a first time user. I'm over 70 years old and found it hard to find ""easy listening"" ""vocalists"" and ""oldies"". For younger users I'm sure it is more useful. Also, I don't like that Spotify automatically installed itself on my computer task bar."
"May 5, 2017","We enjoy listening to our favorite music on Spotify. It works on our laptops, ipads or iphone. I like that it keeps our favorites so they are easily accessible to listen to around the house or at casual get-togethers."
"May 6, 2016","Great! Easy to use, does all that it claims. There are some glitches in some tracks that I've downloaded, not so sure if that's DRM...not sure that it's worth the Premium if all downloads are glitchy. But streaming in my studio is wonderful."
"February 6, 2017","I love this app so much! It has all my favorite songs on it! But I have also realized that it also doesn't have a lot of songs, it plays adds a lot and sometimes after sayings after this add u get 30 minutes without adds.... Then after one song it plays an add. If they fix this I would give it 5 stars"
"August 30, 2017","dont even know why this is here, I do not remember purchasing it, but I have tried it. Spotify is ok. My Band has a spotify channel I did find out! The New Plague"
"July 12, 2017","great FREE service. I withheld two stars as they don't offer any contemporary Christian music selections. GREAT 70's music available! The commercials are a bit annoying but for free can put up with them. I didn't like it well enough to upgrade to the paid version just to get rid of the commercials."
"June 24, 2017","It is quick and easy to set up music choices. It does all the work for you."
"December 1, 2015","This app is so easy, the Spotify library is vast, I love making a ton of different p!aylists; all just super user-friendly. Over the years I've tried a bunch of different music stations like this (Playlist, Grooveshark, Pandora, etc) and this beats them, easy. Haven't listened to radio since establishing my Spotify. I just keep discovering more on Spotify. Love it!"
"September 13, 2015","This app has been the top music player up until the newest update , and I would have rated it 5 stars until this update changed my mind very much . You see, everything is mostly the same , except your playlists . It used to be that you could go through your playlist and pick any song you were in the mood for.Now , you have to shuffle your playlist until it comes to the song you want , which is very confusing and difficult , especially if you have quite a few songs on one playlist. I just think that it was perfect before the update , without glitches and very few adds, but this update upset me very much . I expected a lot more from you spotify ."
"September 27, 2017","Works for me"
"January 26, 2015","I love hearing music, whether I'm relaxing at home or working out, The problem with other music apps: 1. You can't really choose the songs you want to listen to 2. Even if you chose a specific station the music is way off 3. Once you start liking songs, you only hear the same ones every time (Pandora mainly)  With Spotify! 1. You can look up songs: can find entire albums to listen 2. Make your OWN Playlist that will shuffle 3. Less advertising (up to 30 minutes of no ads)! 4. Customizable but with variety- no more same old songs playing on repeat.  If that's not great already their premium is a but pricy $10/month but completely worth it! (You can try their free trial and see what works for you!)  Love this app I have no idea why I didn't find it sooner! Plus you can download the app for free now on tablets and smart phones (not sure if it's always been that way though lol)"
"May 16, 2017","This is the best music app you can have. If you actually pay for it. You can use it for free just like Pandora so its still good to those who do not want to pay. I cant think of any set backs."
"August 3, 2017","I like spotify better than the other music apps I have... I can save songs or entire albums, and the app is seamless across all the platforms I use it on...."
"August 8, 2017","It's the best I can listen to music anywhere or anytime I want because it let's u listen to music without WiFi! Yay! I love it. But one thing. It's been working for playing music without WiFi but then it stopped. Every time I try to listen to music without WiFi on my playlist it says ""you have discovered a premium activity"" or something like that but ya.I think I just have to update it so that's what I'm doing now. Let's see if it works. I hope so..."
"September 30, 2014","What a fantastic app!!! I love everything about jt. I opted for the premium version and the selections and sound quality are 5 star!!!! I also have a headphone amp I connect and the sound quality is superb! I'm listening through Beyerdynamic DT 880's. These have VERY high resistance (ohms) and normally could not be driven by a smart phone(these headphones retail for $550) u can't believe the sound with Spotify ' s equalizer and my homemade amp and the Beyerdynamics!!!???#!#?"
"December 28, 2016","This app is the best music app ever. If you get premium you can skip songs and listen without internet!!! This app is really recommend and you should try it. You could also log in into two devices and connect them and it's amazing. It's ok if you don't have premium cause everything will be free but you have a limit of skipping songs and you would need internet. There are over 1 million songs and it's AWESOME"
"August 2, 2015","Spotify is wonderful, what would I do without it? I use it in my art classroom while students work, and I listen to it while I work in my studio. My only complaint is ads, I just wish they were a bit more edited for content as people of all ages listen to Spotify. I had to stop using it for a while in class because there were Trojan ads on every hour, I really didn't want parent complaints."
"September 11, 2015","What is there to say? Spotify on the Amazon Kindle Fire simply works. And it works as it should be. No problems, no hiccups. I love the way to use it as a remote when playing Spotify also on my computer or television. But most of all, it just has my music where I want it. And this app is simple to use, responsive. It should not trying to do more than that - which is what makes it a great app for me."
"November 9, 2017","It doesn't deserve 3 stars, more like 2.5. Spotify is great for free. You get what you pay for. There is an advertisement before the play list is executed and after the second song. I have several playlists created but for some reason after about 4 songs Spotify inserts artists I never heard of. Looses internet connection a lot. Like I said, you get what you pay for."
"March 25, 2016","will never go back to Pandora I Have a list of 3000 songs put it on random everything from metallica to Madonna pat benitar to pato Banton have a live music list, reggae list, 80s new wave list, I even have a list of my top 50 or so songs and only allow myself that list if I am exercising,, free is great"
"August 22, 2017","I like this all, but everytime I try to use the next song button or the shuffle button it would say that it is a premium feature which I am a premium member."
"January 26, 2017","This is my favorite music app. From the Your Daily Mix to providing your list of favorite songs of 2016, the app is intutive and valuable. Pandora sucks because its repetitive and feeds you tons of live music which I think sucks. Spotify has a depth of music and like my girlfriend in the bedroom, knows what I like! Bow-Chika-Bow!"
"February 15, 2017","New app for me, and I never knew how it worked. It is wonderful!! I went on for the first time with a song in my head, and was able to find it, plus the entire new album, and listened for hours. Excellent! Plus, I really enjoy the radio stations; the selections fit well, good variety. Not too many ads, either. A keeper app for me!!"
"March 15, 2017","Great for discovering new music. Does have ads but they are not overwhelming."
"May 10, 2017","I used to have Spotify on my tablet, however I deleted it after running out of storage space. Love the music, yet very limit choices to Asian culture lovers"
"October 6, 2017",";-D"
"July 4, 2017","I was using this service in its early days when it's had a pretty okay music library and didn't shove Spotify Premium down your throat ever other song. Now, have you heard of Spotify Premium? I heard that you get higher fidelity sound, the ability to download your favorite music for on the go listening without using your phone data. You can listen to what you want when you want."
"September 25, 2017","Great for listening to a whole album! If you are from the 90s generation or earlier, you remember the significance of the cadence of songs and the intended flow of music. I find my new bands with Pandora, and establish my favorites with Spotify. After that, I DOWNLOAD THE REAL ALBUM! Music is important, so pay the artist."
"May 5, 2017","I love Spotify actually. Its easy to use, has cute designs and very easy to find new music. You can even create play lists which is cool. The ONLY problem I have with it is that sometimes it says ""Wait 30 min for the next ad"" and then next song I play there's and Ad. But beside that first world problem, Its great!"
"February 18, 2016","Spotify can be great if on Android devices it didn't pause 10 seconds before the song was over for a few seconds and then continue to play! Also, when you listen to the ad for 30 million minutes of ad free minute I always get 2-4 adds before my 39 minutes are over!"
"August 2, 2015","Being from Europe and like German, Italian and French music. This is the greatest music station ever. You can build your own radio, 1000's of German albums and from over every country in the world. If you classical fantastic. I also love 60's music form America. You will love this station. I promise it. 7 days are free, or you can pay 3.99 this is word it. It is a great company."
"July 14, 2017","I love it! It makes daily mixes with new songs you haven't heard, basically recommendations, and I have never been recommended one sing I didn't like! If you exit the app, the music still plays, which is great for gaming and doing my digital art and animation memes. I love everything about it and have nothing bad to say except I can't stop using it now!"
"September 20, 2017","it is not possible to save my music on the SD card, I Have a fire of 8 Gigas and my music is around 10 Gigas, so frustrated"
"August 23, 2017","I wanted to download playlists to use while exercising. Advertisements play every couple of songs, breaking momentum. The mechanism to organize personal playlists is not apparent. Will not use again."
"June 27, 2017","I'm a classical music enthusiast and hate most music apps for their inability to treat multi-movment classical works in their entirety. At least the paid version of spotify let's me turn off ""shuffle"" so I can play whole albums in proper track sequence. Same for playlists I create. Information on the pieces is sadly without detail, generally not including all of composer, conductor, and performer."
"June 24, 2017","love it"
"May 31, 2017","Has it all. Old and new Blues, Jazz, rock of all ages and now my songs are set up to be played when and where I want!!!! Thank you Spotify!!!!!"
"May 2, 2017","Great selection! It takes a little while to manuever around the app to find everything. Wish it was a little more simplified. Other then that, im happy"
"December 30, 2016","It's really obvious Spotify wants you to upgrade to premium, and they certainly make it known ( and make it known, and make it known...ad nauseum) On the other hand, it's NOT like Pandora: When you ""OK Google"" an artist, you GET that artist, and not song after song of someone's subjective opinion of what you ALSO might like."
"October 26, 2016","Spotify is my favorite music app. the monthly fee is minimal considering the massive music library you get access to. new music consistently added, list features allow you to save you favorites in a detailed way."
"February 5, 2017","You have to get this app. It's So Amazing! You Get To Choose Your Music and Make Playlists! You'll Have Fun With This App!😻 Please Get It. it's Good!Listen To Spotify Forever Its Amazing!!!!!!"
"May 30, 2017","The app is significantly worse than the website. It will not let you select and play an album; it looks like it allows you to play an album on shuffle, but even that is deceptive, as it will include music that is not part of the album."
"August 10, 2017","I guess it is okay for people who are looking for this type of app but it doesn't fit my needs so that why I only gave it three stars."
"February 20, 2017","I absolutely love this APP. I downloaded right to my home screen so I have easy access to get to it faster . Great tutorials to teach you how to use this app and very easy to use and find out what the title of a song on the radio is. [...]…. Many Thanks! I would recommend this product to friends and family."
"November 3, 2017","Having trouble importing my music on my kindle fire from iPad. Gave up and downloaded Spotify. Easy to find your fav artists."
"May 28, 2017","Been a pro user for a couple of years and I've never been more satisfied! Having music with me wherever I go (even no service thanks to offline mode) has been a life saver. Highly recommend!"
"December 9, 2014","The app is great, and I love how you can follow peoples, make your own playlists, have all of your songs in one place.... I love it. However, for some reason my Spotify has a glitch and it won't work for hours or even days at a time! It says I don't have internet connection, but I know I do because my internet works and any other games or apps I have that need internet access to works, even when this isn't. Also, there are other peoples in my house with Spotify, and it works well with them - except for a minor glitch such as mine. But besides that, it's a great app, and I think it is better than Pandora or I Heart Radio. Just giving my opinion. Thank you."
"August 18, 2015","I have always loved Spotify! It's free and offers the best quality music you can hear, because it only has the album versions. And even if there's advertisements here and there I don't mind, but I honestly plan on getting premium soon so I can have music offline too. Aside from the great music, and easy to use interface, you can also make your own personal playlists to listen to anytime you want! And if making a playlist isn't your thing, you can start a radio station based on one song or artist, and Spotify will play you songs that are similar or related. All in all it is the best free app out there for music.  I highly recommend Spotify to anyone!"
"May 15, 2017","I used to have Pandora and Spotify is so much better. It's nice to be able to select a specific song to play, Pandora doesn't allow you that option. And so far Spotify allows me to skip as many songs as I want if I don't want to hear what they suggest. Pandora only allows you to skip so many songs at a time, then it makes you wait to skip a song after you have met your quota for songs you don't like."
"August 8, 2017","Spotify is a really good music app. If you get premium you can go advertisement-free. You can create your own playlists and make them public or private. You can even access other playlists created by the Spotify team or other users. The best part is that you czmanb access full music albums from your favorite artists for free. I 100% guarantee that this app will fulfil your needs."
"December 9, 2014","So much more enjoyable than those other music apps! I like how it's laid out and easy to use. I can find any song and it immediately plays; no waiting for ads! And I love creating my own playlists to fit my mood. If I'm feeling lazy, there's tons of prepared playlists to choose from. Like, those to fit my mood or one to get me pumped up to start doing the laundry. I'm sticking with Spotify and don't use any other music app."
"October 28, 2017","The library of songs is comprehensive and easy to use."
"September 28, 2017","This is the most awesome player that has every tune that I have asked it for and more! It is easy to use and convenient to access from PC, phone, tablet, whatever!"
"March 10, 2017","Love the array of choices, and will play it for you my Bose speakers for hours at a time."
"June 5, 2016","I love Spotify. I detest being forced to employ Facebook to log in. Myriad attempts, through Spotify, to correct the problem have failed. The software offered to eliminate Facebook adamantly 'thinks' my desire is to change my password, part of the process, but not the goal."
"August 23, 2017","Best music app ever! I finally got it, I wish I would have done it a long time ago. I purchased the family plan, so we can all enjoy it."
"July 17, 2017","I haven't started this app yet, but I'm really excited to do so. I mainly got it to listen to music by Ninety9Lives, if possible. So I can't properly rate Spotify, so I just gave it 5 stars."
"August 21, 2017","Awesome! Best way to listen to music!!! I can listen to whatever I want any time of every day! Spotify is Awesome!"
"April 3, 2015","I JUST CAN'T PUT MY FEELINGS FOR SPOTIFY IN WORDS! J.K . Anyway spotify is a great app that will give you free music! You can listen to your favorite JAMS whenever you please. Talk about heaven! (; Though you have to have WiFi life can go on without it! Plus if you really need to listen to music all the time just buy it or get..SPOTIFY PREMIUM! There are no limits to spotify! If you get this app you definitely won't regret it! (:"
"January 23, 2016","I'm very happy with the Spotify app. I have certain spotify playlists that I follow: i.e. the Bonnaroo playlist. Great for hearing bands coming to the festival before you get there. Spotify helps you find your new favorite music + naturally lets you hear your current and old favourites too."
"October 8, 2017","I use Spotify all the time. Love it!"
"August 1, 2014","Spotify is an absolutely mind blowing app. I have the version with minimal skips and shuffle play, but my brother has an update where it is completely free and there are unlimited skips, back-skipping, songs on demand, and you can (still free) download the music to your device to listen without WiFi. He also has a kindle fire HD, and we played no money for his. It's a fantastic app, worth even five dollars, but it's an even better deal because it's completely FREE!!!!!!"
"October 31, 2017","Overall, I like the app. Wide choice of music. It plays entire tracks, with noisy ads in between occasional tracks. The ads are louder than the muic, and not controllable. Of course, if I were to pay for a premium subscription, the ads would go away."
"August 5, 2017","I can access the music I enjoy quickly. Just type the group or song, and it comes right up. Really nice."
"September 13, 2015","I use this app ALL the time, and I love it. But, now I have only one problem. My Spotify updated, and now I have to listen to everything on shuffle. Now, I don't have premium, so when I skip lots of songs, there are lots of ads. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but it sucks. Oh, you want to listen to Girls & Boys (or any song)? Shuffle. Search for a song you need to add to your music? Shuffle! Now, aside from this minor difficulty, the app is the best thing. Great work Spotify!"
"June 23, 2017","I LOVE spotify it has everything for you, it recommends music, to what you've been listening to. You can find different genres of music, if you are wanting to listen to rock, they (spotify) have multiple playlists of that genre, if you like Indie music they have it, pop, rap, love music, acoustics, etc. they have it all. Spotify is the app for you. Spotify also has a 7 day FREE trial. I definitely recommend this to you."
"May 29, 2017","Before Spotify, I'd gone through so many perilous journeys to download free music . But Spotify makes it so easy, and I don't even mind the 10 bucks a month!! The music is unlimited and every song is on there ! No ads, extra fees, and all your favorite songs at your fingertips?? Uhh yes please !!!"
"August 28, 2017","Has been getting better and better over the years. Great plan for family at the right price. Synching offline to be able to listen to music in planes: works well and offline storage remains on SD card. Not a problem anymore."
"October 8, 2017","Sooo cool.I love listening to music, but at the same time hate the adds."
"August 28, 2017","It's not as user-friendly as Pandora, but once I figure it out I'll bet I bump up the star rating!"
"June 9, 2017","I love this subscription; it links to Shazam and many other popular apps and devicesl"
"December 21, 2016","Spotify is a great music streaming app, I actually prefer it to Pandora for the reason that I have more control over exactly what artists play on my stations. I would highly recommend this app!"
"March 13, 2017","Spotify is great on tablets and computers because you can play whatever you want just for ads, but on a phone its still good but not free for everything (which is understandable. I love it more than amazon music because it has a larger variety of songs AND talk shows."
"September 11, 2017","I am enjoying the free version of Spotify and considering the premium version. If I could express one concern/issue, it is the fact that every time an ad comes on the volume is dramatically increased....literally to the point where it is painful. I understand the need to have ads for the free version, and I'd be OK with a slight increase in the volume, but what I experience for a volume increase with each ad is far beyond what is required or what reasonable customers should be asked to tolerate. Any chance you can throttle it back into the reasonable range?"
"August 9, 2014","I am still in the the ""honeymoon phase"" , having fun picking out the wide variety of music I love. There isn't anything that I haven't found and some I forgot about. I had not read any reviews prior to picking them out, my aim was to listen as I drive, I see I need premium. I don't want to pay but do I really think its going to be free? Nothing ever really is but someone has to get paid for all this. For now I'll enjoy it as is."
"August 23, 2017","I listen to my 70's tunes all day at the office with my run bluetooth speaker in my desk drawer! No need to my playlist Hadassah just pick your station!"
"July 7, 2017","I simply love this App...it is intuitive, and detailed and let's me listen to some of my favorites!"
"February 4, 2015","The Spotify premium subscription is well worth $10.67 a month, can't live without Spotify, I use it everyday at work and when working out. So many choices of music, with lots of playlists for different occasions and moods, also you can generate your own playlists, you can also skip over songs without being penalized. Spotify is the new ITunes, in my opinion.**"
"January 16, 2016","It has the best songs in the universe plus the songs are free!All you do is search for a song/singer and add it to your play list!! I love this app it is way better than I heart radio or any other song appreciate it openly play's the song/songs you picked!!Plus you can pick if the song has cuss words in it so it's safe for people of any age(I'm actually just 8 years old !! I'M Listening to it right now because it lets you keep on listening as long as you don't shut down your device!! So if you like listening to music while using your device than get this app!!!!  PS if you have a kindle fire it will still be playing if you just press the power button once  Also GET THIS APP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! review by Carson Bruce Harwell"
"August 3, 2017","Why is it that you will click to shuffle a playlist, (example) Hamilton, and it will start playing one direction?"
"August 20, 2017","Spotty is Awesome It is Much Much more better than Pandora"
"December 23, 2016","I've been with Spotify since 2014 and turned Pandora fans into Spotify lovers. However this past spring, I thought hmmmm let's check out Google Play's music app, and after 2 months returned to Spotify. Your app, and the new lay out and updated features are AWESOME! 🙋 Your team has always been helpful when I had ?'s and promptly with responses. I'll continue to be a long time listener and supporter of Spotify!!! Thank you"
"June 4, 2016","Has millions of songs! Also it only shows adds every 30 minutes, and the adds are only 14 seconds long! Also I can play a good song on and hop over to Minecraft and listen while I play! It plays songs on most of the games I have, even Fnaf!"
"December 28, 2014","I was a faithful Pandora listener both at home and work then I discovered Spotify. What's not to love? ad free, music available offline and they have every artist I look for. So why only four stars? Spotify has to do what Pandora manages seamlessly-allow me to block explicit content. I cannot stream radio at work for fear of the f-bomb emitting from my speakers. Fix that and you will have hit the sweet spot!"
"June 5, 2017","I. Just got a kindle and the first thing I wanted to download was an app that I could playbmy music on. Spotify did just that. One thing I would change though is that there is no clean version of songs. I have a younger brother that cannot listen to my music because of some words said. Now I can inky use earbuds. Please fix this"
"November 10, 2017","I love it. As a classical music lover, Spotify has all of the great classical labels."
"January 18, 2017","I LOVE Spotify!!!!! I have found some really obscure music and rare deep cuts in this app that Pandora just can't compete with!! I highly recommend this for any and all music lovers!!!"
"November 2, 2017","It works, has all my music already preset and I am good to go. Yes! Thank you Amazon!"
"November 30, 2014","I used to use Pandora an thought I would never use anything else. That is until I was looking for a music downloader and found this. So glad I downloaded it! Basically it's like Pandora and YouTube rolled into one. You can listen to stations, make your own stations, and my favorite part: you can search a specific song an listen to it right then. You can also save your favorite songs to a playlist that you can listen to whenever! Another plus is that this app has NEVER crashed or malfunctioned in anyway since I've had it. Absolutely beautiful design as well, I love this app!"
"June 27, 2017","I like Spotify, but their app needs a lot of work. The layout is nice, the ads aren't that intrusive, but It's very slow to load and there are little touches that would make it more user friendly, such as placing a pause button on the lock screen of your phone."
"June 26, 2017","Is there a song you can't find on Spotify? I am amazed at the wide variety of music on Spotify. If you love music, you need Spotify."
"May 1, 2016","Enjoying this so far, accessible playlists are great for me as I find I have less time to create my own. Thanks to all the users curating great playlists on here, you are my heroes and you make the platform what it is."
"August 28, 2016","I thought this app wasn't going to be as complete as it is for the other platforms but I guess it's taken from the official Android one and it's complete!  Everything I expect it to have it does. Can't really complain about anything, doesn't crash, not laggy (Kindle Fire HD 7"").  Thank you Spotify!"
"May 31, 2017","I just wish there were some videos. But, the sound is good, it's easy to use, and a good place to hear music that has been removed from youtube."
"June 13, 2016","10/10 great"
"July 29, 2017","Full version of the app is great, but the functionality with Apple CarPlay frankly sucks."
"December 9, 2016","Not used much yet, but highly recommended by a Friend that is an I.T. SPECIALIST & their kids. So will try since I love ALL my music except RAP. Great to have such a collection...old tunes, tunes grew up to 80-90's, country, classical, blues & jazz, Christian, & All the NEW. Try it & if not for you..you can uninstall❣No commitment❣💋❣"
"September 14, 2016","This app is really awesome !!!! Nothing like other music apps. I like that you can listen to random music or create your playlists of songs you like !!! Other apps don't give you that option. I love this app !!!"
"February 1, 2015","I use spotify all the time, especially when I'm studying. I always am happy with the music it suggests and I feel that it does a lot better job of guessing what kind of music I like to listen to than Pandora and other music apps. It kinda sucks that you have to get premium which is about twenty bucks a month to turn off ads and to download music off of the app, but that's about the same price other music apps charge and with spotify you get some extra perks for your money. Great app overall."
"November 12, 2016","Very nice idea!😃 I can play my favorite songs anywhere! Pls just fix something... which is the music randomly goes away and off my task bar randomly.. pls fix that but overall, nice job! 😀"
"March 15, 2017","I love this app and it's pretty cheap for the monthly premium subscription. There are times when a song or two are not available but I'm sure it has to do with licensing issues that come with artists and streaming services. Otherwise I think it's worth the $10"
"July 28, 2017","It amazing"
"August 18, 2017","Love their music service but clearly don't understand customer service! I understood that i had student premium plan for 12 months, when it was coming close to 12 months i talked to customer service and asked to renew again. They said they did it and i got charged for 9 months without student premium. My fault for not noticing right away, and its not about the money. But the amount of attitude i got for even showing a concern that i never got an email confirmation or an email stating that i must renew. Complete lies and honestly sad that Apple music has better customer service that Spotify. That more highly of them."
"January 21, 2017","I like the fact that I can follow my friends' playlists as well as search for new and old music alike. I have been introduced to new music I never knew I'd like and reminded about old bands that I forgot I loved. Highly recommend. Will pay for premium one of these days so I can skip songs but the free app is cool too."
"April 30, 2017","Spotify has all the music I like and it's easy to set up your lists. You can find whatever you want to listen to."
"December 25, 2016","I have downloaded this app 5 times. When it opens, all it says is ""Internal Error"" that I may not have a strong enough signal, but that does not appear th o be the problem. Heard this is a great app and want to use it, but right now, I'm not impressed."
"September 15, 2016","Great App. Have access to my own music and some great playlists. Even free with the ads isn't bad."
"June 3, 2017","Fewer ads than other stations like P... Like my daily mixes picked just for me. Highly recommend."
"September 27, 2017","Oh my I was so surprised how easy to navigate this site. Music for everyone."
"June 12, 2017","wished I would have know earlier about Spotify, its great. If you love music its a must have. Easy too!"
"July 24, 2017","really sweet app, I have used a bunch of other apps and this one I really do like."
"April 22, 2015","Spotify is set up to help you find your own personalized ""hidden gems"" and ""stumble-upons."" You can choose from lots of genres and sub genres and seemingly concocted styles to form your own playlists. And for 10 bucks a month you can have playlists available offline too. And if I'm not mistaken you can publish your playlists, and share playlists between friends (double check on that feature though). So yeah, Spotify's the bestest."
"June 13, 2016","I LOVE IT! This has almost everything! Only song writers who have not put the album's they make like some internet sensations are not on. I love this so much, you can keep replaying playlists or just a individual song by a simple button!"
"August 22, 2017","great catalog on music I have rare old guitarist you can not find somewhere else.on my play list thank you gor your service"
"July 20, 2017","Large selection of music.I do the free version.Its great making your own play list"
"May 28, 2016","I love using Spotify. It has nearly all the music I want. The free version does have ads, but I don't mind them so much. Although, recently the video ads have not been working, so I get stuck on the ad and can't move on to a different song. Other than that, Spotify is great!"
"May 8, 2017","Great choices in music! I am a jazz aficionado, and this app gives me the best choices of music. I love it!"
"August 17, 2017","Money well spent. I just wish Spotify didn't have a download limit for devices."
"August 7, 2017","It's never good when your laptop for business is down all day because of malware. I'm having to bust my laptop back to 0 because there is not a malware or antivirus program that can fix the problems of Spotify software. I can't tell you if using spotify is a good or bad thing. I couldn't get past all the garbage that their software downloaded to my computer. And I used the software from their personal website. Then, they wanted to know if I wanted to upgrade and pay for it. This has cost me enough."
"August 9, 2017","This app is great! It's better than Pandora.  Larry"
"August 13, 2017","Within a library of millions of songs, artists, and community playlists, there is something for everyone, and Spotify makes the experience of finding it a joyful one. Make your own playlists, find your favorite artists, and save your favorite songs. Browse a huge selection of heavily accessible genre's. And most importantly, listen to them on your own terms."
"December 22, 2015","Spotify has all the songs witch is awesome. It has every genre of music that you can think of and has the greatest songs. Also spot if uhh is cheap and has great deals. The moment that I got spotlight I got rid of all my of music apps. It's awesome how when I am on the road I can have downloaded music that I can listen to unlike Pandora. Spotify has songs on there that haven't even come out yet. You can listen to it on different devises when ever you want."
"January 28, 2017","I'm a Spotify Premium user. I've been using Spotify for nearly two years now and I love it. The versatility and diversity of music is amazing.  The app works well and it is easy to move from the tablet to my phone and then to my computer with ease."
"August 16, 2017","Love this app for music . Daly mix is great. Great for podcast aslo."
"April 22, 2017","Awesome product, it completes my retirement life, I use it multiple times, every day. Thank you Spotify."
"August 23, 2017","The app is so laggy I have to slam on my screen at least three times even pounding the palm of my hand on the stupid ""continue"" button doesn't work, and I'm still on making a playlist step and its already pissing me off, I get it, a lot of people might use this app,but seriously it should not freeze up like that!"
"April 30, 2016","I love Spoitify...I don't mind the 2 or 3 mins of commercials....its really not that bad...though I'd like to pay for premium, but I don't like monthly withdrawals....and I don't see a cancellation.. that said the library is extensive"
"October 18, 2017","Good selection of music from jazz to rap to big band. Great for dancing in the kitchen or listening to movie soundtracks."
"August 28, 2017","This is a great item. Easy to use with great selection of music"
"January 3, 2016","I love Spotify. The app is flawless. I use it every day, whether it be while playing the Xbox or going on a long road trip. Spotify is heaven for people of all music-tastes and I really thing it deserves 10 stars, not just 5. Although there is one problem. Literally, one. When trying to skip a song or two offline (I have premium), the song that I skipped to does not load and I have to wait to connect to WiFi before being able to listen to a different song, really confusing, because it says that I had premium. :|"
"February 23, 2015","For some reason the interface bugs me but other than that it works well, reminiscent of grooveshark but with not much of a limit (I think). Some songs are hard to find and I wish that they had an option to filter out clean versions of songs so I didn't have to add a song and go back and find the dirty version like some kind of Neanderthal after I realize this travesty."
"July 21, 2017","Would give a zero if possible.... It won't let me create an account.... It says that my ""information has changed"".... How has it changed?!?! It hasn't! I put in all of my information in it correctly. My email, the password I wanted, my birthday, and my gender...."
"October 11, 2017","great"
"August 10, 2017","Music was great had everything I wanted. At one point I was able to log on to my account on my smart TV, and my tablet and play from there. I am giving 2 stars because I was no longer able to sign on through my smart TV or my tablet and there was no customer service available to help fix the problem. Therefore it was useless to me..."
"May 1, 2017","The app is good but I don't like how they don't have certain songs. But it's still a fun app to use."
"May 1, 2017","The best music app EVER!!!!!! YES!!!!! I can't afford the premium package. But it's still worth all the mini second commercial! Outstanding. When I can again. I'm going premium. You can Download your music and still listen off line on the go!!!! Thank you Spotify. I love music. It's my therapy. This is a genius idea."
"August 14, 2017","I'm so pleased w/ this app.!!! I 'm a very poor - financially - ,Senior who missed the music I've had around me all my 70 + yrs...This app brings it back to my welcoming Ears ..!!! (even though there are commercials..) I'm grateful none-the-less..!"
"May 29, 2017","If Amazon Music was available on the Kindle...I wouldn't be here. Spotify is a very weak little brother in comparison...playlists are weak and have too many b sides. And the French commercials are irritating. Bring back my Amazon Music App! Please!!"
"October 27, 2017","Spotify perfect for every song you could think of. Spotify.Com is the very best of the best here on Amazon.Com. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great sale here on Amazon.Com Best of the Best"
"December 15, 2016","I shouldn't have waited to long to go premium, spend the money it is much better and worth it. Beats Pandora and Sirius XM hands down"
"February 20, 2015","Spotlight is the best solution I have found to provide the quality, quantity and user friendliness that I expect from a music player. It is on in my life almost 24 hours a day. It allows me access to New artists as well as my age old favorites. I am a premium paying member which allows me access to my music even when I am off-line. I love my Spotify!"
"August 16, 2017","Nice app., But i can not sign up for the Premium Account, because i live in a non supported country."
"December 15, 2016","So many different kinds of music, dance, calm, relaxing, energize, sad, happy, play, sleep, work. Just Amazing  Love it. Thanks"
"June 28, 2016","Great music app. I have the upgraded version and it's worth the $10 a month. Commercial free music, ability to save music off line and create custom playlists, all make this the only app I will ever need for music!"
"May 25, 2016","I purchased this so that I could get this program on my tablet and phone. The down load went quick and I was able to view both on the table and phone that I have. I would recommend this product."
"February 17, 2016","Less than CD quality streaming. If you have audiophile class equipment, especially headphones. music especially the highs sound granular and perhaps slightly distorted. Tidal in this case is better and clearer. On normal class headphones it is good."
"April 30, 2015","Yet another music streaming app. The app's front end is annoying and has interface issues with Facebook. Off and on it took me three months to get it properly working on all my devices. Help is community based, which can be both a blessing and a curse. Obviously, I have mixed feelings about this app. However, it does have potential, and because of that I would give it a slight nod over its main rival, Pandora."
"July 16, 2017","Blows Pandora out of the water. Awesome configurations easy to use, and just awesome."
"September 27, 2017","I really enjoy this app,lots to choose from,not just music, you have poetry,podcasts. I have great poetry from Langston Hugh's,from Nikki Giovanni,to Gwendolyn Brooks and thier reciting thier poetry and stories in thier own voices,great such and of course the great music! Thanks Spotify you rock!!!!"
"April 24, 2017","Favorite app, love how it is customizable and has a great selection of music. My go to app!"
"February 2, 2016","I love this app I use it everyday my only problem with it is that at first you can only shuffle you can't choose the song and it has to be online or you can't listen to it offline without buying Premium. I don't know if it happened to anyone else but after I had it for awhile it allowed me to choose the song I want to listen to but I am very happy with this fact. Other than the things I mentioned I loved this app"
"August 11, 2015","I recommend Spotify to everyone! This is the best $10 I spend every month. It has almost everything from your local band that has 7 people go to their shows to the big boys. And you can listen to radio (with no ads all the skips you want) to find new music. It's really turned up my music game. I love New music Tuesday s my whole office listens to it then talks about it. Great bonding at the office."
"November 2, 2015","I used to listen to Pandora quite a bit, which my son introduced me to. Then I told him one day how much I enjoy it and he told me &#34;oh, I don't even use Pandora anymore, Spotify is much better.&#34; So I tried it and have to agree. My ONLY issue with this free application (I haven't upgraded yet) is that any station I listen to seems to repeat several songs...but overall, I really enjoy it."
"September 3, 2017","Given up on trying to get this app to work...Pandora rules!"
"February 16, 2016","I just use Spotify Free but I like it a lot . It's a great place for finding those old songs that you haven't heard in years as well as the newest music out there. You can save your playlist to your computer to play while online. If you go with Premium you can take some of your music with you and play it offline on your portable devices. It's a great music site."
"May 28, 2017","Spotify still doesn't see the need to provide any ability to control content, i.e. no option in settings to choose the ""radio"" version of songs and block explicit content versions. Not only is this an issue for users under 18, but it's an issue if folks over 18 are want a music app to provide music at a party with kids. They have a ""family plan"" but the app is not family friendly at all. Also, all the lyrics are available for any user, no care about age. As a parent I will not load this on my kids devices, as an adult I will not use it on my devices."
"August 20, 2017","I hate the new update, it use to be good until it updated"
"December 3, 2015","I'm using Free Spotify andI like it alot. It stays more true to the genre or artist you choose. This was a real problem with iheart, but in all fairness it's been awhile since I used that app. Pandora used to shut down all the time saying something about getting eaten by a bear. So you'd have to keep going back to the computer to let them know you were still listening."
"August 17, 2017","I love it because I can listen to my favorite songs."
"July 18, 2017","Awesome product to find any music you want, and organize/order it in any way you want. Find a song you like and listen on repeat, collect your favorites and hit shuffle, or set up your queue to play specific songs in the order you like. Download your favorites if you want to listen offline as well. Never regretted buying this product."
"March 31, 2016","Spotify is awesome because you get to pick your own music and you get a 30 day free trial of all downloads on Spotify just not where you Getzlaf I premiums and it's also really find that means you will have Pandora add every time you skip that means you don't listen to your song so you like not get recommend it sucks"
"January 20, 2015","If you have 4g lite it would be a lot better. But if you don't you have to upgrade it but it won't let me. I'd say it's good if you have Wi-Fi."
"June 10, 2017","With Spotify, I can create my own playlists, and fit my music to my mood! So glad it was created!"
"April 24, 2017","My dad got me premium, and I've been using it for over a year! Works great, took a while to get used to when I first switched from amazon prime, but other then that, it really works!"
"November 11, 2017","I love this app it is such a great app I use it every day"
"September 30, 2017","App is awesome but the customer service is horrid. We cancelled a free trial we set my mom up with but for whatever reason, the cancellation didn't process. We were charged several months for no usage (because we thought it was cancelled). Spotify had no interest in discussing a refund or anything really. Keep in mind, I already have my own premium account and have had it for YEARS."
"August 21, 2017","Love this and its my #1 music app right now"
"September 1, 2017","Spotify is a wonderful free music app that I enjoy very much. I can create my own playlists and also listen to others. Spotify customizes multiple daily playlists based on the types of music you listen to. It also shows you concert tickets and newly realeased albums. My only criticism is that you want to listen to a certain song, download a song/playlist, or skip/go back then you have to pay. That's not a ridiculous asking price I'm just too cheap. I thoroughly enjoy this app!"
"August 23, 2016","I had heard about this but thought it was like Pandora. This is not the case. With Spotify you choose the music that is played."
"September 4, 2017","Spotify is a great program for multiple reasons. One of them, it's free. Another, you don't have to have it open to listen to music. I definitely recommend it, it's a great program."
"June 24, 2017","Nothing to smile about. The 9.99 price...per month. Not worth it. Would be better off sticking to the non premium version, putting up with the ads and not bothering to download anything. Just kidding. Wish I could afford it. Maybe one day. Why does the logo look like a... Nevermind."
"March 11, 2016","This is my own purchase for my sons. I personally is a very shopaholic person. Whever there is a deal , even just few bucks I am still may go fo it, including this current reviewing product. However, even I paid myself, I am still sometime has strong opinions... Like this spotify, everything is good except it is not free! LOL~"
"July 17, 2017","Spotify's great...but, then again, you already knew that."
"August 19, 2017","Good variety. easy to find music that I like."
"June 21, 2017","Why did I wait so long to try Spotify? The current 99 cents for 3 months deal pushed me over the edge. I may not be able to look back. The app works great on my Android phone and Kindle. But where it really shines is on my Echo."
"July 18, 2017","This is the greatest thing ever.i don't buy music any more. I use it at work home and in my car. I use premium, no commercial,plays what ever I feel like and when my selection is over it continues playing based on what I was listening to."
"August 1, 2014","This worked so well. At first I had no hope and thought that computer would be better but I was wrong. Even has Minecraft songs. You can even listen with your tablet and or android off. And to what I see on kindle fire HD it doesn't drain the battery. All you song fans out there who have a favourite song that they just love listening to sell you can listen to your fave song over and over again. I love this app"
"August 16, 2017","Way better then pandora! Ha!"
"June 16, 2017","I can listen to anyone I want for free! Plus, there's not that many ads."
"August 6, 2016","Love Love LOVE Spotify! Easily the best, most user friendly way to listen to music. I love the wide variety of playlists to choose from- you can search a mood or situation (e.g. ""sad rainy afternoon"" or ""office friendly jams"") and *bam!* there is a whole list of potential new favorite playlists!"
"August 5, 2017","Its a great app for free music you have to pay if you want to use it offline but I love how I can connect it to other devices and control it from my kindle."
"November 4, 2017","This is the best app to listen to music and does not intrude your privacy"
"September 23, 2016","This is a music app that lets you can make custom music playlists for you to listen to.but there's one issue...you need wifi to use it!you need to get premium membership to download the music and listen to it anywhere.besides that,it's a great app.I highly suggest it."
"March 4, 2017","Very good. Unlike many other music apps, you can love sten to what you want when you want to."
"June 18, 2015","I love this app it is very cool other apps would make you buy the music but in this music app you can just get a artists whole album for free and if you are a kid who is not allowed to have pay for WiFi they can give you three months of premium for just 99 cents get this app it is America axing you can even make your own playlists and everything just get this app it also works on kindle fires :)"
"August 18, 2017","It's great that this app is free! Gives access to pretty much any song you'd want to listen to; with that said I did the free trial with the Premium account and haven't looked back. I use it every day on all my devices and absolutely love it. The ""recommended for you"" and ""discover"" features are also great"
"August 11, 2017","I am a fan of spotify and the selection"
"July 13, 2017","I wouldn't listen to any other music app but spotify premium ."
"April 30, 2017","Always has the exact song or music I want to hear by various artists..even obsolete, rare finds!"
"February 20, 2015","Love that I can add all the music I want to a playlist of my own creation, or choose to listen to an already made playlist. Its a great way to be introduced to new music/artists. When listening any where else but your computer, playlist can only be listened to with shuffle. This works perfect for me, its what I end up doing anyway."
"June 2, 2017","I like the ability to play my music how I like to listen to it"
"October 14, 2016","This app just keeps getting better and better, I've used it for 6 months now. Good updates and features that make using it easy and convenient. Good for finding similar bands to what you're listening to in real time, and seeing what your friends are listening to."
"July 30, 2016","Spotify is the ish,I'm so addicted to it.I like how your music is sorted to different playlist and if you haven't played a certain playlist they remind you of the playlist that you can come back to.The sound quality is terrific"
"May 26, 2017","it's easy to try new music and run across old forgotten favorites"
"September 10, 2015","I absolutely LOVE Spotify. I have not been able to find one fault with it. They have A TON of music and I mean a ton. I pay for the premium version every month and it is completely worth it. There's no need for me to buy music anymore. Yes it's that good."
"October 13, 2016","I love spotify, I switched to spotify over pandora long ago. I still use it but I do wish the spotify premium was cheaper..."
"October 18, 2017","Where would I be without Spotify???!"
"July 28, 2015","So I love this app and since I moved to the US FROM japan I can't here meh JPOP I just miss my music u might be asking didn't u get your phone from Japan, yes I did but it broke so I got a new one in the US and a new music downloader but it doesn't have meh JPOP. Plz add some I miss meh JPOP music D:"
"January 16, 2017","For home use, Spotify is hands-down the best service out there. Not so much so on the go because of a lack of selectability of your artist's songs and albums. I it may be asking to much but it would be nice if you could use Alexa to control Spotify without having to pay for the premium upgrade."
"June 18, 2016","If you're looking for an EPIC music app look no further and download Spotify, I'm the kinda person who listens to music 24/7 and I've tried DOZENS of music apps and none compare to Spotify. Its amazing and the best thing EVER!!!!"
"November 9, 2017","Spotify premium. Music everywhere!"
"September 20, 2017","Now I have to buy a subscription where it use to be free."
"April 1, 2016","Great app. It plays music from many different artists with good audio. The only reason I didn't rate this five stars is because they don't have certain artists, probably the most popular one Taylor Swift. That's too bad, since this is a great app."
"August 17, 2017","I went through yahoo music, Google radio, Rhapsodxy (crap!), and being sold around and around until I quit. I chose Spotify. I still choose Spotify. I recommend it to everyone."
"March 28, 2016","I was looking for a new music site! I had pandoira but out would stop on me for no reason! I love Spotify! The music is easy too find and my favorite playlist is awesome! I recommend Spotify!"
"June 25, 2015","Spotify is wonderful, I pay the $10 subscription and now my cell phone is my music collection. plugs into my car and home stereo via bluetooth. You can follow a muse and pick an artist you've liked in the past and see the body of their work. I re-discovered Electric Light Orchestra ELO lots of fun to listen. And now to Classical music is unlimited, hearing Composers I never heard before. Great."
"November 3, 2017","Love the options it provides - I can't get premium now as I lost my job in Aug - but music makes it all ok"
"August 5, 2017","Large music library. Love that it makes daily mix playlists based off of what I listen to. Radio stations are great too. I have premium and I think it's worth it."
"May 25, 2017","I love the oldies!!!! I downloaded this app testing it to see if it was better a little better than Pandora and guess what!!! It was! I like it better that Pandora because you can play only what you want or you can play anything!! Keep at it!!!!!!  BTW, my youtube channel is Seany Productions Inc. and you can see from my first video, me singing, how much I like the oldies!"
"July 27, 2017","It's Great! We love having a musical variety without commercials we simply pay for Spotify Plus for a month or two and build up our libraries and download the music and discontinue the Spotify plus until we're ready to download more music it's a great product and we're glad we switched to Spotify versus Pandora."
"December 29, 2016","Even though you pay $9.99 a month on this its so worth it, I can listen to all music and even download, best part im from NY so when im underground in the train i can still hear my music 😊"
"March 6, 2017","Enjoying listening to music I love. Best thing to happen to my Kindle. I am hooked."
"March 29, 2017","The very best music app out there. Every song I have searched has been found."
"November 7, 2016","I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH, I LITERALLY HAVE 7 PLAYLISTS AND EACH HAVE OVER 100 SONGS. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE, THE MUSIC QUALITY IS GREAT, THE DOWNLOADING SPEED IS FANTASTIC AND ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT😍😎😊"
"August 20, 2016","first for $9.99 you cant get a good CD, on spotify you get to experiance genres you new imagined. music is beautiful art for the mind and this makes it cheap, portable and so easy. try it you'll love it true me."
"March 7, 2017","I don't have premium and I'm sad about that but I love this app. I love how it gives you various options of the same song. I will get premium one of these days but for now I'm good on shuffle. Plus I like how when they play adds its only like two or three at a time, not like ten. Definitely recommend this app and it has to be my favorite and most used app on all of my devices."
"December 9, 2016","Whether on a Kindle, an Alexa Echo, my phone or tablet, I am ALWAYS guaranteed to find the music that's moves my body and uplifts my soul. Truly, the best music App ever!  Jacquilyn"
"March 7, 2016","Fun app to access all kinds of free music. Big hit with the teens & anybody who likes music... especially FREE music!!"
"January 11, 2017","Can't be without it Spotify it's the best out there, no searching for other songs from the same band like Pandora. I've been with Spotify for years now and no complaints. None whatsoever 😎"
"October 12, 2016","I love this app you can listen to the songs you want you have skips and you also can have the music and any loudness or whiteness you want my whole family loves it they have the app to there are 7 people in my family I suggest you should get the app 😁😁😁"
"October 12, 2017","Its spotify on kindle... what more is there to say?"
"May 6, 2017","Awesome update to an already great music app, I just wish it had already updated itself. #Spotify RULEZ #Love it"
"April 1, 2016","So many playlists to match your mood snd what you are doing. Sound quality is great and it includes ads that when watched allow 30 minutes of ad free music 😄😄 Almost all songs available plus acoustic and remix versions. If you have a favorite artist, they even have artist radios that you can listen too. STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!"
"October 31, 2014","I have used both the free and upgrade versions. If you do not like commercials the upgrade is the way to go and the cost is not prohibitive. I have tried other ""Free"" Internet music sources and found Spotify the simplest and best to serve my eclectic music listening. You can find ""old"" or ""new"" tunes or albums ranging from classical to country with ease. Fill your library and enjoy as I have over the past five years."
"April 4, 2017","This free app works great and the music on Spotify is also very good."
"April 28, 2017","Free with ads or pay extra to be ad-free. It's a good service."
"July 18, 2017","I love Spotify so much I use it pretty much everyday, I've made so many playlists. And I have premium now which let's me listen to songs without those annoying commercial interruptions"
"July 28, 2017","I'll never be without my Spotify ever."
"April 29, 2017","Spotify has all the music you could ever want! Great selections. Great personalized playlists!"
"May 8, 2017","I really can't complain. It's free music and it's good quakity . 👍"
"July 11, 2017","Love Spotify but they still have yet to fix the issue where when you first connect with your car, the app freezes and you have to close the app out and restart it...it's very annoying..."
"September 27, 2017","It has all the songs you could think of and plus every single day a song comes out it puts on Spotify right away"
"September 7, 2017","I have been using this app pretty much since I downloaded it."
"February 17, 2015","Get this, there's offline option. I use no other means to listen to music anymore. And to ""artist"" like Taylor Swift who are not on it (every other artist is on it) your s*** isn't worth listening to anyway. We pay for sporting it may not be much but not everyone wants to spend 13.99 on a s*** pop CD when you can spend 9 on sporting and listen to every other amazing artist to grace this earth haha"
"July 7, 2017","I listen to this app everyday. I wish I didn't need premium to listen to spotify offline."
"August 1, 2016","I love the millions of music choices I have but I can not play the song I want when I want without buying the full version. I love the songs that have in my library but sometimes I am in the mood for one song and not the other. Also it does not help that I can not listen to music via spotify in a no wifi range. I could Download the song but that will also cost me money. And if you decide to do the one week free trial pressing download will not actually download the songs ."
"June 12, 2015","I like Spotify as a way to hear my favorite songs on a playlist. The only problem I have with the app is there is no ""back"" key to get out of a dialogue link I don't want or accidentally got. Also, it would be a great help if the app had a ""directions for this page"" pull-down menu. Otherwise, once I learn the ins and outs, I think it will be a great addition."
"December 21, 2016","The basic non-pay service offers quite a selection of music and we're having fun building our own custom playlists. Great music offered. We did purchase a blue tooth speaker for the house and are enjoying music that we love without having to change CDs or search for an additional channel since we have already build our playlists. Great service."
"November 9, 2017","Love it! So easy to use."
"June 22, 2017","I loved any of my exes as much as I do this app."
"August 27, 2017","To many ads plus you have to have premium to do most stuff like download songs to your phone or taplet"
"October 20, 2016","I love this app! I only have one complaint, sometimes when I watch the ad for ""30 min of ad free music"" it doesn't give me the 30 min but I still had to watch the ad. Other than that this is a awesome app."
"May 3, 2017","Very high quality musicand has all the songs that I like"
"March 18, 2017","I've used this app for the longest time and it never failed to make me smile. But, in the newest update it doesn't quite let me add a song to a playlist or either save, or share it. Please fix it, Thank you!"
"August 13, 2017","I love spotify. They usually have all the songs I want and if they don't have some there's tons of other songs to listen to. This app is great form it you wanna use another app but still listen to your music. I love listening to my music when I'm playing a game or cleaning."
"March 1, 2017","It vworks great on my kindle love it I have it on my cellphone also LG Phoenix"
"May 17, 2017","Very happy with this music provider. Has many options."
"August 11, 2017","It's free! How can you complain."
"January 15, 2017","Don't mind the title I couldn't think. This app is an amazing use and not a waste of time. Recommended for anyone who loves music. Though Spotify could use a couple of more night core songs. Other than that everything is fine 👌"
"January 21, 2015","I really love the Spotify Music App. because I can pick all the songs I want to hear without the ones i don't want to hear. I am a huge fan of the 70's hits and you never get to hear the ones you want on a regular radio. Also I love all kinds of Christian music. I don't have to hear a lot of stuff between songs, I can go to the the song I want to. Thanks Spotlight.  Sherry Hepner California"
"October 16, 2016","I absolutely love this app. You will find pretty much find any kind of music and song title you are looking for. And the fact that if you subscribe to the premium service you can listen to the music offline. In my opinion Spotify is the best music app out there."
"February 29, 2016","WAY better than Pandora! Free music that's actually not too limited without premium but premium is cheap and its really cool. All your favorite songs, albums, and all music that Spotify is able to get their hands on for free. FORGET paying $1.99 per song. For mobile devices, as long ass you have WiFi you have Spotify without using data. And with premium you can be wiout WiFi and without the data loss. I personally that no its amazing."
"March 4, 2017","I've used all the music apps you can think of and this is by far my favorite user friendly app. Has everything you could want and great for sharing with friends. I honestly think it's one of the greatest inventions of all time. Thanks Spotify!"
"December 13, 2016","You have total control of everything you want to listen too, as long as Garth Brooks isnt what you want to hear, lol. Set up your playlist with anything you can think of in a certain order or just hit shuffle and you have listening for hours or days depending on how much you want."
"April 8, 2017","Two things keeping this from 5 stars, 1) there's no sleep timer for android. I know there's some work arounds and apps, but it should already be there (use IHeartRadio when going to sleep for this issue) and 2) certain bands/songs missing. If either of these issues ceased (or both), 5 stars."
"April 4, 2016","When I first heard about Spotify I thought it was just another streaming music service but boy was I wrong.  It's just what I been looking for! An avid Jazz fan I cannot tell you how many titles I have found that weren't on many of the other services. Whatever your genre Spotify has it!"
"November 27, 2014","Great Awesome!  This is the best app ever!! I can't recommend Spotify enough. If I could give it 100 stars I would. With headphones the acoustics is awesome on my Kindle Fire HD. I can locate any song ever played and at it to my play list! The app doesn't drain the battery, user friendly:), and have very little if any commercials. I have tried quite a few music apps but after finding this gem I deleted all of the others. I play one song of my favorite artist/group and Spotify continues on with the songs from the same group/singer.  Thanks Spotify!!"
"July 29, 2015","Well let's say I love all songs ands on some apps they don't have a bunch of my favorite song,......But This Way better now I got black widow Shark in the water ands all that this is the most popular ,Amazing wonderful and simple to get started My mom has it Ands She LOVES IT!!!! I do too mostly half of my family haves it this is a music app that can be the one to inspire you ands make u get in the Pool-! 😄"
"April 29, 2017","This is a great app, it plays a lot of good songs and you can choose your favorite artist and I haven't run into anything I've got to buy. Plus, once you make a playlist, you can skip as many times as you want and play that song over and over again. 😊 Great App!"
"May 24, 2017","App works well on phone and Amazon Fire."
"September 9, 2017","Enjoy listening to chosen music."
"June 26, 2015","This is a great app, even the free version. I've set up several categories, one for Bozz Scaggs, one for Sam Smith, one for Steely Dan, one for individual tracks or particular albums. It's a great, carefree app. There are a few ads with the free version, but so far they don't bother me. They do have a service without ads for a monthly fee, for those who prefer it."
"January 13, 2017","I have found so many playlists that satisfy me, no matter what my mood. Music I want to enjoy, all day with no commercials. New music recommendations to explore. It works flawlessy with my Android devicex (Amazon Kindle and BlackBerry Priv).  a"
"September 4, 2017","LOVE SPOTIFY SERVICE"
"January 18, 2015","I love spotlight very much, the innovation of having music is very attentive to the listener's choices of what type of music to enjoy, only wish that the commercial could be weakened out a little more so that the listener's can enjoy more without signing up for the premium. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get the quality of music and sound they are looking for in music"
"August 27, 2017","This app is so great! You can all the songs you love from Twenty one pilots to Sam Hunt! You can make your own playlist and pick songs that you love! This app is always satisfactory to me.👍"
"April 13, 2017","I would give a -100 if I could. Spotify has removed your ability to play your playlist on Roku. I can no longer listen to my music through my sound system connected to the television and Roku which is pumped throughout the house. When I contact Spotify and Roku they constantly duck the issue pointing the finger at each other. I am cancelling after 4 years of membership because Spotify doesn't mind jerking their customers around! No care for customers=No customers!"
"May 18, 2016","I've been using app for many years and I LOVE IT you can add songs to your playlist and unlike pandora giving so much commericials it gives just about 2 commercials in spotfiy but because i bought the premium i can create my own playlist and listen to what ever music i want to listen thank spotify you really saved me"
"May 18, 2017","Easy to use, not many ads, Great Music selection."
"August 4, 2017","This app is great for keeping all your music and doesn't have a lot of ads."
"July 27, 2017","whenever im depressed, i comnect my speakers to my kindle ane blast 2000 emo music and spotify never fails to provide the best. Especially when im dancing around at 3am in my pajamas"
"December 27, 2015","U should definietly get Spotify!!! Its an awesome app! U can listen to music wherever u go, u can make ur own playlists, and u can have followers!!! There's only 1 bad thing.... Adds... You will be listening to ur fav songs, and then BOOM an advertisement add will skrew up ur music!!!! If ur on a different app u have to go back and fix it!!!!😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬 otherwise, its a great app and u should get it!!!😂😂😂😂😂"
"May 3, 2016","Spotify is my go-to app for listening to new music. I surf through or search for and I'm never disappointed. My only complaint is never having enough hours in a day to listen to it all. App is reliable and delivers music just as promised."
"December 28, 2016","Its the best music app ever!!!! It TOATALLY beats Pandora!!!!! By the way if you like any of these bands/artists please push helpful... Arctic monkeys Twenty one piløts Fall out boy Rage against the machine Chevelle Black sabbith Green day  Thank you!!😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀"
"August 23, 2017","It works great on my kindle"
"October 6, 2017","baboon music, great."
"July 13, 2017","Exellent way to get my music!"
"April 2, 2017","Not a day goes by when I do not utilize this ap. Love it"
"November 10, 2017","I use Spotify every day!"
"January 19, 2017","What bad things could I find to say about spotify? I love all the different playlists it comes up with. I love I can mark a song I like and it's saved to a separate playlist. And the discover weekly is great as well."
"March 14, 2016","Spotify is a really awesome app. I love listening to music while cleaning house and doing craft projects. With Spotify I can listen to all my favorite groups and/or songs. I'm glad that I've come across this app. You can try it for free or if you don't like ads you can subscribe for a low price!"
"August 25, 2017","I Love Spotify !!!!"
"August 10, 2017","I love it I need WiFi for it tho because I am on tablet but its still amazing I play games and listen to music to get me pumped I highly recommend it I can't download the songs tho I want that to be fixed"
"September 9, 2017","I liked the variety of music"
"January 9, 2015","This app is BLEEPING awesome!! I am new to Spotify but I downloaded it on my WP8, my wife's android, my kindle, and on both my daughters' kindles. While I'm sure I screwed up that sentence grammatically, it is far and away best on the kindle and it's not even close. On the kindle app, I can add songs to the queue, search much easier, find the artists that I follow and it is just plain easier to use."
"August 25, 2017","Still working great for my BlackBerry Passport. Recently updated the app and still my music companion. Just this app is a battery hog. Keep your phone on plug when using spotify."
"August 3, 2017","Best music app you could get for free. Even better with the membership"
"May 3, 2017","Love Spotify... Just need to upgrade to where I won't have commercials... Love that I can type in any title and so many different songs pop up.. Adore this app.. Definitely would recommend this app to someone.."
"May 2, 2017","Easy to navigate and great selection and sound!"
"September 14, 2017","I can listen to that good good McElroy content those are some excellent boys and I love them and Spotify let's me hear them be stupid for free."
"April 8, 2017","Don't like the download button on the top. Like I accidetly switch it and u have to re-download all of my music."
"March 12, 2017","Love spotify. Such an amazing selection of genres. We use it at church as well as in my office because of the large selection of Christian artists and instrumental easy listening. Worth the upgrade."
"August 25, 2017","Won't trade for other providers!"
"May 4, 2016","Even though I love Spotify when it says premium and u can listen to music anywhere they are not telling the truth I got it for 7 days free and I went where there is no WiFi and couldn't listen to music but other than that it is the boom!!!!😜"
"May 3, 2017","I've used the Android version of Spotify for years, very pleased to find it on Amazon. And it's kept up to date with the Android app."
"April 21, 2017","I've tried other streaming services but always come back to Spotify. Love my personalized DISCOVERY WEEKLY playlist every Monday morning and you can't beat the subscription price!"
"September 11, 2017","Love it."
"September 15, 2017","I love this app! Spotify is the future."
"February 18, 2015","This is the best app ever! Music that I want to hear when I want to hear it! And they offer two choices of payment--a short ad every three or four songs like radio or $9+ a month for no ads. So far I've found every song I've looked for. Thanks for a great app and a great service."
"November 6, 2017","Very good"
"January 26, 2017","So far, whenever a song pops into my head and I HAVE to hear it NOW, spotify has never failed to have it. I like many genres of music and it all seems to be just waiting for me to ask. What could be better?"
"October 12, 2017","It's okay"
"February 25, 2016","Awesome. [I pay for G* Play because of my regards for the numerous offerings I use from G* for free.] My heart belongs to Spotify. Spotify is accessible from the likes of A* Echo, and portable devices, as well as off-line. Spotify has superior diversity and ""Lists"" and interface."
"March 9, 2017","great place to listen to any music under the Sun Or Moon!"
"July 31, 2017","this game is good and that could update"
"June 8, 2017","I love it. I can listen my favorites song anytime."
"July 27, 2017","no problem easy to sign up. free and lots of music."
"January 30, 2017","Who doesn't love music? I wish there were more of my favorite songs on here, but for the most part there is a rather large number of my favorite hits on this app. I love it and recommend it to others."
"November 6, 2017","Great"
"March 22, 2017","Don't know what I did without this music service!"
"November 2, 2017","good"
"October 5, 2014","I only listen to the free music. I do not purchase the upgrade to listen commerical free. The commercials on the free level can be annoying. Spotify works perfectly. It is easy to search for music. Users can create their own playlists. You can listen to or follow a playlist created by someone else. The variety of available music genres and artists is large enough that everyone can find something they like."
"November 5, 2015","Best subscription service of all time. I have not liked a music service this much since the real Napster. I will say that Apple Music has several artists that spotify is missing(Taylor Swift). However Apple Music does not currently work with android devices. No android is a deal breaker for me. Amazon's Prime music service is missing so many artists it is hardly worth mentioning."
"April 28, 2017","With Spotify, I never hear the same ol' same ol'. I am hearing many songs for the first time by my favorite artist. I love giving my mind some new info in the form of music. Spotify is the best music app!! I listen as I workout and hearing all the new music makes time fly by quickly. Thanks"
"August 4, 2017","Works very well."
"July 2, 2017","The Spotify app is easy to use, even on my Fire tablet! I like the capability to share playlists, and the radio function makes it easy to discover new music."
"May 13, 2017","Love the music selection, hate the limitations."
"July 6, 2017","This app is so great. They got Taylor Swift back which is awesome."
"October 22, 2016","I have a subscription to Spotify and this music site is awesome. I have found so many songs and artists on this site. I can download to my mp3, laptop, kindle or just list on Spotify. I'm very happy with my Spotify music app."
"June 13, 2017","Spotify is best I mean best music app I have ever had in my life,it's platform, it's music access. All I can say is wonderful app. Thank you for it."
"December 20, 2016","Just signed up a few days ago, so can't honestly give it the 5 stars ... yet. I do like what I've heard so far. A very extensive range of music and when picking your likes, it offers more within that category, which is a nice feature. That said, I haven't found all my tastes in music at this point, but again, I haven't had much time to ""play"" with it. Definitely enjoy my music life better with than without it!!"
"March 1, 2017","My favorite app. I can listen to this all day and night. You can listen to music with the screen off so it saves battery. I can listen to an 8 hour long playlist and turn the screen back on with battery life left to spare."
"June 20, 2017","It really good that you don't have to pay to get started and you get. Free 7 days for the thing"
"March 19, 2017","Fantastic! And the premium upgrade is actually worth it."
"September 29, 2017","I've had spotify for a while now and the amount of music available in every genre you're into is endless. I just wish they had this 30 years ago!!!"
"December 6, 2015","Subscribed to Beats for over a year, and I loved it, used it daily, but the transition to Apple Music for Android was less than nominal. Spotify has an equally massive library, with an interface that is both simple and functional. I subscribed midway through my 7 day trial. :)"
"July 9, 2017","I love this app! I only give it a four due to the fact that not every song is on here."
"September 18, 2015","Spotify came out with an update that makes it to were everything is shuffle play unless you buy premium. So every time I want to listen to a song I have to hit shuffle play and hope for the best. But I found that the best way to find your song is to either make small playlists or quit the app and go back into it when it's not your song."
"November 6, 2015","This app is great for Kindle! I love how when you close the app it still plays music, and it's even better because it is free! I can get tons of music to listen to without paying for it. I am only giving it four stars though, because at first I thought it was really confusing to use. Other than that, it is great! 🏇"
"July 4, 2017","This app is Awesome!!! I have Amazon music and this has more music than Amazon! I would definatly reccommend this for everyone😎"
"September 4, 2017","Excellent choice of music for any occasion. I was able to find my 70s Prog music plus other titles that are hard to buy."
"April 19, 2017","best app i have ever gotten in my life!!!"
"October 2, 2017","best"
"February 4, 2017","Excellent music source... free platform commercials ARE mildy annoying. Good value and a variety of playback methods. Plenty of mainstream selections, some gaps (assume that's artist prerogative). fairly comprehensive choices from emerging artists."
"July 27, 2017","It wouldn't start playing another song, on its own, after a commercial/ad."
"July 25, 2017","Not only does this find thes song searched for, it finds every version of it. Thats great when you have time to review each version and select it into your playlist. In a party situation its too easy to put the wrong version into the queue. This is my only criticism . Its an excellent app."
"October 4, 2017","Love it"
"February 3, 2016","I love spotify and that I can listen to any genre is awesome! When I hear a new artist, I just look them up and add the songs that I like. How could it be better? I love the radio too when I don't want to pick out each song. I don't remember what it was like without Spotify and I don't want to!"
"July 29, 2017","Useful app."
"July 30, 2017","It is easy to use and is very nice for being a free app."
"April 4, 2017","I love Spotify. It's the only music APP I use."
"January 25, 2016","Spotify has a great selection of music and spoken word works. It's not just an app for listening to music but also has audio books, selections to learn different languages, and stories among other stuff. There is something for everyone and it is simple and easy to use. My only complaint is that when listening on my kindle there is no back button in the drop down bar at the top. When you are in another app and want to go back you have to reopen spotify to do so."
"August 14, 2017","GREAT"
"January 3, 2017","Really enjoy Spotify and the ability to choose the actual songs I want to listen to. 30 minutes of ad-free music after listening to a couple of short ads is awesome. The only feature I wish it had is a sleep timer."
"February 2, 2017","I think that it is a really good app. Also I really like it because you can pick your favorite songs to listen to. Also I really think it is better than pandora cause pandora just picks the songs for you."
"June 26, 2017","I can go straight to what ever songs, albums, artist I want without waiting."
"February 18, 2015","I love that you can play a single album or listen a mix of all the artists song .... for FREE!! It saves ur current artists you have been listening too! Create ur own playlists! At times the serve is down but it's only for short periods! U can do about anything you like! Better then Pandora!! Ads aren't long or bad hardly come on! I haven't upgraded cuz I don't need too!!"
"February 20, 2015","I have always been scouting for an app that truly understands my music tastes and preferences, and Spotify is just the app. It is currently free, compared to before when you had to pay (but it was worth the price anyway).  Definitely a try, given that it's free and even better in its recommendations of soundtracks that you might not chance upon using other apps or websites such as YouTube.  However, as it is a free app (for now), be prepared for ads to be inserted in the midst of your playlist though there is a paid feature to turn off the ads."
"May 24, 2017","Love spotify! It is everything I wanted in a streaming music app."
"January 22, 2017","This app is great with bunches and bunches of playlists picked by Spotify and some from other people, tons of artists, and not just the ones that are popular right nowor even in this country. Its especially cool because, at least on my version of one of the newer kindles, music from YouTube won't stay playing in another tab or when in an app, but Spotify will."
"December 22, 2016","I was very skeptical at first, I mean... Free music, really? But it's great! You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it's totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!"
"August 11, 2017","Great!"
"March 25, 2017","Love my Spotify Music had it for over 3 years"
"December 30, 2016","I can't say enough about it. It works, has what I like and is easy to use. The commercials every 30 minutes are not a problem at all. If you listen to radio, you get commercials. If you listen on Spotify, you get to choose what songs or artists you want to hear."
"March 19, 2017","Its way better than Pandora I love it"
"August 21, 2017","I love spotify,I don't mind the adds for the free service. I would pay for the service if they gave discounts for seniors like they do for students, they are missing I believe a large subscription base."
"September 4, 2017","I have more control over my music compared to the rest. I've built great playlists i can download. Awesome selection of new artists/music."
"June 6, 2017","Excellent app for listening music"
"June 12, 2017","excellent music app"
"September 4, 2017","base be boomin"
"June 26, 2017","I love spotify and I'm a premium user. Love their radio and their folders option! Good app all around. I like their music discovery options also"
"July 30, 2017","Spotify is thee #1 app to listen to music from. Its easy, smooth running and glitch free. I defenitly recommend this app."
"September 12, 2015","I use to use spotify all the time! The newest update makes it non useable! They're forcing me to use shuffle play, putting on songs I've never even heard of, and taking me off of my playlist! And it keeps shoving the premium upgrade in my face! I sincerely hope that spotify will go back to the way it was."
"November 9, 2017","great"
"May 23, 2017","has devils swing,get out ,and more like dont tattle on me fnaf,fnafsl,tattletale,batim,DAgames,and remixes(TLT)"
"July 20, 2017","Love it!! Well worth the monthly $"
"June 11, 2017","Awesome I just gotta get used to using it. Finally getting my music need met."
"July 18, 2017","Love it, you can listen to anything you want at anytime. Premium would most definitely be better but for now I am happy with free spotify"
"August 25, 2017","Annoying adds but ok for free"
"February 22, 2015","Now, to begin, let me just say that Spotify is nearly as good as Amazon Prime. Nearly. The only downside to it is that you have to pay $9.99 a month if you want to listen to all your favorite tunes offline. Other than that, THIS APP IS AWESOME. The variety of music makes it hard for me to choose what to listen to next, and you can create your own playlists for free."
"March 22, 2016","For the relatively small price of a basic subscription, the options of downloading REALLY great music to your phone to stream no matter where you are and unlimited skips, this service is a steal. However, the unexpected stops while streaming data free can be frustrating, though it is more likely a glitch with the app than the service itself. Apart from that, I love it!"
"July 31, 2017","I love Spotify. I have a few playlists downloaded to my fire for bus rides. I love that it will play in the background while I read a book."
"April 23, 2017","Cannot spend 10 bucks any better"
"October 26, 2014","This is so nice because you get to choose your songs and not just the artist like Pandora. I recommend this if you want to listen to certain songs. It is very nice when I want to listen to a certain song or songs. And you can add songs when ever you want and there is no limit. I think this is better than Pandora because you get to listen to songs you put on and with Pandora you get to choose the artist not song and it doesn't even stay on that artist."
"August 28, 2016","Great option to Amazon prime music, nice app. We love and use Prime and also Spotify for stuff Prime has not available free. Louder too than Prime. We got the trial subscription for $1/3 months and $7 / mo thereafter. worth it."
"April 6, 2017","It is pretty good because it allows me to listen to many songs wether it's fan made or actual music"
"February 10, 2015","I use on a daily basis since hearing about it almost a year ago. Pros: LOVE the selection. 90% of what I want is available. Easy to use. Can use on multiple devices, just not at the same time.  Cons: Sometimes the connection gets blotchy, understandable as its a net based app.  Overall, quite satisfied."
"June 24, 2017","i wish the songs showed the lyrics like amazon prime does"
"February 28, 2017","So far have enjoyed listening to music that I haven't got to hear in a while."
"August 26, 2014","I love to use Spotify on my computer, and now it's FREE for tablet! I AM SO HAPPY! Who needs premium now? Not Me! Spotify is amazing, it even has stand up comedy recordings like Bill Cosby. I wish I could rate it more stars! Anyone who loves music should download this app immediately! PARENTS CAUTION! Spotify does have some explicit content that can not be monitored unless the album cover warns you. So I recommend listening to your child's music before letting them! Great app it is THE BEST! :)"
"February 20, 2015","The music end of things is excellent - variety, choices, interface. The system requirements when running on a very new PC is ridiculous. It uses a large portion of your systems resources, so everything else acts oddly and sluggish. I like the mobile app, it has it's flakes also. But overall the Premium version of this app is decent."
"December 27, 2014","I downloaded this app about 6 months ago and I immediately bought the premium version. It has nearly every artist and song (minus Taylor swift) and the new songs are released here as well. If you go premium, you can add songs to a playlist and make it offline, which downloads the songs so you can listen to them when not connected to WiFi. Also if you're in college, you get a discount on going premium. Overall this is a great music app and definitely worth your time."
"May 24, 2017","I like this put the only problem is that when u play the music it go away. Like I am a lazy person I have to go to spotify and put the song again 😧 the music erases every time"
"January 31, 2015","Virtually unlimited amount of music to listen to from all genres. I have found everything I wanted to listen to. Best of all its all free. If you want to avoid add interruptions you can purchase the premium service. Now you can enjoy unlimited music without spending an arm and a leg purchasing other media."
"May 3, 2017","Nice to not have ""are you still listening""interruptions"
"November 3, 2016","Finally got a membership with Spotify and let me just say, I LOVE IT. Now I can organize all my music into playlists for when I'm driving and it's been really helpful. I love the fact that they reccomend undiscovered artists through their playlists so I can find new songs to perform and listen to."
"July 14, 2017","love it"
"June 5, 2017","Spotify is a very good app you only have to watch a 20 second add and then you can listen to music for 30 minutes you can listen to any song when you want and there is no max skip like I heart 😎😎😎😳😳😳😳😁😁😁😀😀😀☺☺☺😮😮😮"
"May 31, 2017","I like the quality and variety of music you have so I like this app a lot. But I don't buy premium so I deal with a ton of adds but I still like the app anyway."
"October 26, 2016","Works great. One of the few apps that work fine on Amazon, I did have a problem at first with logging in, but since then I am able to log on with no problems and the sound quality is amazing from my Amazon HD 10."
"March 24, 2017","It has a few bugs to work out. I use this app daily and I love it. The ads are kinda annoying and the 30 minutes with no ads isn't always 30 minutes. Other than that I love it"
"May 14, 2017","I love it! I have found everything I have looked for from the Beatles to the Lemon Pipers to Scott Joplin and John Coltrane and Itzhak Perlman!!!!"
"August 7, 2016","I really enjoy Spotify. It has an easy to use interface, it is customizable to your tastes, you can create your own playlists, and best of all you can listen to music offline. For all of these reasons Spotify is a win win situation for me."
"September 14, 2015","I just downloaded this onto my kindle to see how it worked and it was really fun. I loved it. But now I can't play anything or skip without downloading prime. I came here for free music. Also the he click the banner thing kind of sucks be cause the banners really big and kind of hard not to hit sometimes."
"August 4, 2015","This amazon version is way better than the phone version. On the phone version you can only save your favorite songs then have them shuffled. You can't pick what ever song you want. However, on this app, you can choose whatever song you want, shuffle the music, all with just a few ads every 30 minutes."
"August 7, 2017","Awsome i can listen to my favorite songs"
"April 4, 2017","Great music any time you want it"
"August 9, 2017","Love it"
"April 22, 2017","Outstanding for all ages"
"May 31, 2017","Really good let's you create playlists of your different styles of music you like and have a library and not have to buy every song . When retired very nice.I know"
"July 14, 2017","This app is amazing u have unlimited skips u can listen to what u want its free I love this app bc for meeny reasons"
"June 20, 2017","love it!!"
"January 15, 2017","I love this music site...Would love to have this on my laptop computer"
"November 15, 2015","It works just as well for Kindle as it does on my laptop and my husband's PS4. I haven't done much aside from saving the songs/albums I like and listening to them. The availability of some of the artists is really nice, compared to other programs that don't have the latest music."
"July 18, 2016","I see why everyone loves Spotify. The only thing I wish was different is I wish it would let me re-order the items in my playlist. Apparently the songs stay in the order you add them. There's a 'shuffle play' option, but that's it."
"July 24, 2017","Great app my whole family uses it"
"September 5, 2016","I can use it on my kindle fire like I'm on my own world I can pick the music I want I can share the device if I want to but I may have ads and stuff but I won't get the premium it too much for music if your gonna download it on your phone just don't cause it's not as the best like on as kindle fire 😢😄😄🎶🎶🎶🎵🎴🎵"
"February 8, 2015","This app allows you to play music/songs. If a WiFi connection you can create and play playlists with almost any music you could want. By purchasing premium you can also download the music from your playlists to listen to at anytime. The free version does occasionally play ads, however two 30 second ads every 30 minutes or so is worth it considering the amount of selection and customization available for free."
"August 20, 2017","I enjoy spotify music"
"April 9, 2017","Great way for me to listen to music on the go or at home. Has a ton of mainstream and indie music. They keep on adding new features and improvements. Can't complain about the price as I feel like I get my $$$ worth."
"October 28, 2017","Can find the singer's I like and the songs I like to listen to on my mobile. Best selections of old and new . Would like more coroners like Frank, Dino and Johnny Mathis."
"February 27, 2016","I switched from I heart Radio to Spotify at my boyfriend's suggestion, and I haven't gone back. I enjoy building my own library, and I've made and shared playlists with a couple of people. I also like that you can add others' playlists to your account. I find this app to be extremely easy to use and plan to continue it as my favorite music app."
"December 9, 2016","Use Spotify all the time to listen to music. I love how you can download the songs in high quality to listen to them anywhere. Not only that, but I get to be up to date with all the top songs to listen to!"
"September 14, 2017","Love love love love love this app. I am on it constantly at work and at home. I love that I can create my own playlists."
"September 28, 2017","I really enjoy all the gems on Spotify. But some of the albums I've saved have disappeared randomly (Motorhead's last album among others). Would like to know if it's gone forever...but other than occasionally that it's a great system and app"
"June 8, 2017","I live on spotify"
"May 31, 2017","is the best"
"May 31, 2017","good stuff"
"August 2, 2017","Please don't go away like MOG and RDIO did. You are the only on demand streaming music service that is excellent left. Amazon doesn,t hold a candle to you."
"February 15, 2017","I love my Spotify music. I found songs that I thought I wouldn't hear again. Thanks"
"May 5, 2017","Just started using it and so far I love it! Otherwise I would probably say a 5! Its free that's good!"
"June 12, 2017","I wish I had discovered this years ago instead of wasting all my money on I Tunes"
"March 1, 2017","Tons of songs . I recommend it ."
"April 19, 2017","Great app"
"March 13, 2017","a great app for all music lovers."
"October 28, 2017","I use this app all of the time. I have never not been able to find the music I want. I can't imagine doing without it."
"February 2, 2017","This is the best music app in the whole world!!!!I think everyone should get this music app if they are a music fan. My only complants are that it needs internet and when I x out of it completely it won't let me listen to music for like five minutes. It deserves a 4 star rating."
"August 5, 2017","I can listen to all the songs i love offline and there aren't too many ads"
"June 15, 2016","Best music experience! Love all the playlist. I get to hear new music and artist. For $7.99 I get to download music and not have to use my data to listen. Also has books and poems! No commercials. Come on what's not to love!"
"July 18, 2017","Great selection of music."
"May 14, 2017","works as expected!"
"July 9, 2015","Compared to Pandora better sound, more control of audio quality, and you choose the songs ..... and it plays them. It doesent throw unexpected songs/artists that they think you will like. I like this feature and the quality of sound much better than Pandora. I have used pandora since its inception."
"August 24, 2017","I absolutely LOVE using Spotify!! Especially the Discovery section...it knows what type of music I love and finds more like it for me to add to my playlist. It's easy, convenient, and fun to use!"
"March 3, 2017","love this service, actually paid for the premium service after several weeks. the best music streaming service available with more choices than anybody"
"October 4, 2017","Has everything even for us older folks!!!"
"May 30, 2016","Loved the songs that were on the app but one of my favorite songs... wasn't on there:("
"May 7, 2017","I love the app but I hit the watch now for 30 min of add free music at 28 seconds not 30 seconds 28 and I got no add only my music I was playing."
"October 25, 2016","From early Porgy and Bess, to Amazon Rainforest recordings, to latest Rhyanna, pop, to Theta brainwave enhancing recordings, have rarely not found what I'm looking for. Would like more world wide multi lingual offerings, and a senior discount! Thanks for a great product."
"October 5, 2017","Highly recommended, dunno what I did before I had this. It functions much easier on my computer than on my phone."
"September 12, 2017","Good story."
"August 9, 2017","Great app. Just wish there was not a fee for no ads and music anywhere. Lots of great music and options. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the premium fee. I know they have to make money somehow. 😁🎵🎶"
"August 20, 2015","Works great on my kindle fire HDX and HD 6.. I also use it on other android devices but downloaded from google play.. The app itself is easy to navigate and easy to use.. I have no issues with the app or service"
"September 14, 2016","I love this app! I find it great that you could literally search of almost every song and see it, and how you could go and look at any music for your mood! Although the adds are annoying(not lying, I memorized them), it doesn't come up every 3 or so songs, so I'm happy."
"August 28, 2017","Downloaded, new haven't enough plays to comment---later."
"January 12, 2016","Great music idea for on the go listening of your favoriat stations and singers. Check to see if the spotify app is compatable for your android devise."
"March 14, 2017","Spotify is the bomb for music apps because it is gtreat and has basically every song out there!! I do wish there was a way to get rid of that thing where like if your listening to music while your in the shower and it says click here for no ads you can't click it and then ypou have ads!!!!"
"November 10, 2017","Great design. Fun. So far all the songs I’ve looked for have been here."
"May 24, 2017","GOOD"
"March 3, 2016","Its great I love it!!!!! My got to app for music!!!! But I think that it should make an update letting people like me that have a kindle. Or any phone or table or whatever. It should let us listen off of internet connection. I mean I got this app for me to listen to music. It should at least let me listen off internet connection. But in other words I highly recommend this music app!!!"
"August 21, 2017","One of the few services that plays the whole album. Strong signal and few commercials."
"August 27, 2014","Spotify is the music player of choice for my entire family. Tap into a vast amount of music with this app. We love for the Spotify platform.  However: This app really needs to be revisited as tablets, phones, and non-traditional operating systems (i.e. Chromebooks and Linux) become more prevalent and users begin to use these devices as their primary access to the internet. There are features that are unavailable with this app which make playlist management cumbersome at best. It seems that if you are going to fully utilize the amazing Spotify service you need to have a Windows (or maybe Apple? - I am not an apple user) machine and a copy of the local software."
"September 16, 2015","In this century CD is almost obsolete the new trend is of course digital music online or on a digital device(mp3,mp4,IPhone,IPad,tablet etc)SPOTIFY is a top shelf way of finding your favorite music it doesn't get much easier to use than this !GREAT JOB SPOTIFY May the music force be with you and I hope you live long and prosper!"
"December 22, 2016","I love that I can search for specific composers and artists. There are a huge number of playlists available so I can listen to music I would never have found on my own. Spotify does require a paid subscription, but it's worth it to me. I have found the free services to be limited and I'm sometimes stuck listening to music I don't !ike."
"March 15, 2017","Works well."
"February 3, 2017","This is a great app but my one complaint is that when I open it, it says I am offline, but I am in my own house, and,for some reason, I am only nine but I listen to songs like Your Gonna Go Far Kid by The Offspring. :)"
"November 8, 2017","This app works so well, I'll never pay for another song again."
"May 10, 2017","I was glad that I found this application and all I do is listen to it all the time. Use to listen to pandora but prefer this one"
"January 1, 2015","I love this app (and Spotify in general) but I guess the thing that continually drives me crazy is that there is no way to properly sort by album name (the album's tab sorts by artists and then by album). I know it sounds nitpicky, but it's one of things I come across all the time and just grates!"
"August 9, 2017","its ok"
"July 8, 2015","This app is better than Pandora. For example, you can repeat the song that your listening to, and make play lists. Spotify also has Radios with UNLIMITED skips. You can follow people on Spotify, but there is no messaging other people. So, you can repeat you favorite songs, make play lists, have radios with UNLIMITED skips, and you can follow people but no messages, now that's great deal for free!"
"October 2, 2015","The music I love is not commonly found on radio. So it is so wonderful to find it on Spotify!"
"July 18, 2017","I enjoy music probably more than any one I know. My son put me on to Spotify and I thoroughly enjoy it. Some time ago I thought I had lost it and I just about panicked since I had so much time invested in building up my lists. Listen to it almost daily."
"October 28, 2017","I love Spotify and its great but I have to pay for download and thought it was free but its not, please make it free."
"August 24, 2015","Songs with explicit content are constantly deleted without reason, there's no enough music and the app version does not allow you to choose your song (Shuffle mode), I miss grooveshark so much, spotify sucks big time. :(  I hate the fact that the ""offline mode"" is only music stored in your cache memory and you don't actually own the song, so it's not worth it to pay for the premium user because you are not downloading the songs you can't keep them, recomendations are not accurate with what I would like to listen to, and radios have always the same songs.  Have been a daily user since grooveshark was closed, actually I think spotify should be free, because you don't get what you pay for."
"February 16, 2016","This is an awesome app and I love it! I can use anywhere (when you have premium) and yopu can search artists and artist radios. Yo can even listyen to 80s or 90s music on it! My first thoughts when I got Spotify were &#34;Whoa, how have I never heard of this before!!?&#34; You van also broadcast it onto other devices and sterile without an aux cord!"
"September 17, 2016","I really enjoy Spotify. I like how it recommends certain music just by what I listen to. The podcasts are also another perk. I upgraded just so I could get the full on benefits. The cost is minimal compared to what Spotify offers. It pays for itself!!!!!"
"April 3, 2016","I wish you could organize your individual playlists in an order you want like you can on desktop. Whenever I create a new playlist, my main starred playlist (which I use most) gets pushed all the way to the bottom. :(  Otherwise love this app. It makes my commute so much better and it is a good price."
"March 3, 2017","wish it was free :("
"April 28, 2017","Great"
"November 4, 2015","So yeah, it was nice when I first downloaded it. I got to choose what song I listened to, and I didn't have a limit on however many songs I could skip. Oh, but then here comes this bulls***, I can't choose what song I wanted, it suggests songs that I couldn't care less about, and now I can't even skip it because I've reached my limit, skipping the songs I don't want to listen to.  I got an app that wasn't like Pandora, and it was hella nice. But now it's changed into the equivalent of that.  To sum it all up, I can't choose my own music I couldn't care less about the suggested music I hate the song-skip limit  I just wanted to listen to one song, but then I end up listening to ten because I'm unable to skip over to the song I want.  I'm just disappointed, tbh."
"May 31, 2017","I listen to it every day. Poor Pandora got left out in the cold. I haven't used the commercial free yet, but plan on it soon."
"August 2, 2017","I like it but there are a couple of things they don't have that I wanted. No big deal though. Basically I enjoy it."
"April 21, 2017","<3"
"March 6, 2017","Wish I could arrange n skip with out paying"
"October 16, 2017","This is a very good app because it keeps playing when it's turned off unlike other apps."
"April 27, 2017","nice"
"December 25, 2015","Love this service. Used to have rhapsody. Now they suck. Thank god I found Spotify. Amazon Prime Music is starting to suck a bit too. Spotify all the way! Music, Audiobooks, Language courses, famous speeches, Poetry and more. Seriously? It is totally worth the $10/month."
"January 14, 2016","Love the whole idea that I can create a playlist. Love the fact that I can listen to music that I haven't heard in a while don't like the fact that I can't shuffle my own playlist without the purchase of 10.00 monthly to play my playlist that I've created."
"June 10, 2015","My son downloaded Spotify Music for me - it's amazing the selection of music and the sound quality seems great. Have listened to many of my favorite songs. It's helpful to see how popular certain songs are for an artist if you want to sample some new songs and see what others like."
"May 9, 2017","Fantastic product, love it. no more CD's, no more dealing with MP3 files, no messy USB devices ... I recommend Spotify, especially if you have a diverse taste for music ..."
"March 30, 2017","Very useful"
"June 26, 2017","Easy, prediction engine OK, works for me."
"July 23, 2017","I've been searching for so many music apps here on the appstore but this is the best!! You need Wi-FI to play the music without premium, but this works very well for free!! About flawless!!!"
"October 31, 2017","This is a great app, although some well-known songs or albums aren't on here. But otherwise this is a perfect app!"
"March 28, 2017","Pretty great, would give 5 stars if they had Bob Seger"
"August 5, 2017","I personally never imagined I would stream much music besides the occasional live show.. I've been collecting music in all formats seemingly forever; but now I realize most times I wanna listen to something in my archives it's easiest just to stream it on Spotify!!! This free music app is the best ever, I'm my opinion.. Now if only Drag City Records would allow their artists to stream on this site.."
"April 1, 2017","Great app"
"August 6, 2017","it has a search unlike Pandora and there are more options"
"June 10, 2017","I loved, lisent my favorite music and read my mails at the same time!!!"
"July 28, 2017","THIS IS THE BEST APP FOR MUSIC 🎶 LOVERS EVERYWHERE!! An occasional ad every now and then, but overall it's amazing!👍👍👍 Get this app and you won't be disappointed!!😆😆😆😆👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"December 18, 2016","Works great...wish it had lyrics too!"
"June 9, 2017","Great"
"July 19, 2016","Has a great music library, and I can listen to any type of music that interests me."
"July 28, 2017","I can find music that I want to listen to again!!!"
"December 11, 2015","The reason why I downloaded this app is because I wanted to play aspecific songs , not other music I don't like to listen to. I'm sorry, but I give this three stars."
"October 31, 2017","after creating account it would not let me in. it kept saying my password was wrong. I deleted it just about as fast as I installed it"
"June 14, 2017","This App is outstanding! If you enjoy music this may be for you!"
"May 12, 2017","Great music appp can find all my favorite bands i use it all the time"
"July 15, 2017","Great app. Would like to see a Shazam type sensor in it though"
"October 12, 2017","All around good app"
"October 30, 2017","This is a great music app. I love being able to search songs and put together my own playlists."
"July 25, 2017","I love spotify, it's easy to use, and there is a wide collections of music to choose from. Whatever genre you want, it's there. I definitely recommend this. You can open a new app, and the music will still be able to play."
"September 22, 2017","This is really neat program. The upgrade is needed if you have lots of music and can afford it."
"August 11, 2017","I'm giving it a good because it works, but they send out these ratings way to soon to really test."
"April 20, 2017","So far I'm really liking this...."
"July 16, 2016","I love being able to listen to the Beatles whenever I feel like it! This is coming from a twelve year old I think everyone should at least try it! They have everything like Elmo singing Drive my Car!"
"November 8, 2016","I like spotify, but lately it will only let me listen to one song and then say that if I want to listen to more I have to go premium! I'm just confused it never used to do that to me!"
"July 4, 2016","They have so many playlists with a variety of different types of music. I am being exposed to so many different great artist that I never knew existed. The music is awesome and the app itself is very easy to use."
"April 6, 2015","Turns out this is a good music app for my Kindle. Normally i use Rhapsody, however i've gone above my amount of devices i can use on the Rhapsody and so i went looking for a good streaming music service. Turns out its easy to use, lots of music i didn't think would be on it, is in the library there, i have the free version but it's still very good and I'm satisfied."
"August 4, 2017","Totally worth every cent to get premium!"
"December 29, 2016","I purchased this for my daughter a few months back and she loves it. It is very affordable, unlike similar apps. We could and have highly recommended it to other family members and friends."
"July 18, 2017","Amazing,strongly recommend!"
"March 28, 2017","GOOD!"
"August 11, 2017","I've tried Apple; Soundhound .....found home here. Best source for your music."
"March 27, 2017","Great"
"July 24, 2017","good"
"April 3, 2017","I love that I can choose my own music and add to playlist. But lately, when I get the 30 minutes of ad free music, it gives me an ad within two songs. All the time. The ads have increased tremendously and I don't know what's changed. I know I'm using the free app, but it's ridiculous that they tell me I'm getting 30 minutes of ad free music and then they play an ad after the next song or two"
"July 29, 2017","I use it a lot! I am a music person so I really enjoy using Spotify, if you love listening to music without using YouTube this is the app for you! <3"
"July 8, 2017","Spotify is a very good place to go to and listen to just about anything your heart desires. The layout is easy to use, even for us older folks. Been listening to music long before a lot of you were even dreamed about. Many memories and good times from music. Keep it up Spotify ! You deserve all stars."
"May 30, 2016","This is one of my favorite apps. I love/need my music, and the fact that I can play it in the background is great. However, what's not fun is the fact that I got logged out in a different country, and can't log back in. I listen to music with this app every day, and this is a pretty big deal for me. I'm still in that country, and if you could fix this, I'd give it 5 stars."
"July 20, 2017","THIS IS SUCH A GREAT APP!!! I LOVE HOW IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU ADDS ALL THE TIME."
"July 28, 2017","Fantastic, the best music app!"
"August 22, 2017","this product did not offer the music I am looking for for free. thought is wasn't supposed to use data."
"December 1, 2016","Unlike other music venues, I love the way you can listen to an entire album of a particular artist instead of only one song jumbled up among a bunch of other songs and artists. I love this format, I uninstalled the other venues."
"September 7, 2017","Love it easy to use"
"August 23, 2017","Really enjoy being able to listen to the albums and different artist and enjoying the songs I like the most. Thank you for this app. I get to review songs and be exposed to other songs I would not have heard."
"March 19, 2017","I love that Spotify suggests other music Artists to match the music genre chosen, and allows you to browse through the suggested Artists' music via Singles, Album, or Collaboration and place it in your own created Playlist or one already generated."
"January 19, 2017","It would be nice if it didn't get slower with each update. For whatever reason theres now a lenghty black screen before loading the artist list. It used to be a 5 in my book, but there's ni reason it should take longer to load on a new device."
"May 16, 2017","Listen to it all the time, Who's Pandora?"
"May 29, 2017","I've heard about spotting and I would really like to have it. Well when I go to make an account I put in everything that it tells me to but once I click done it says that there is a problem and my information has changed. What?"
"June 18, 2017","I only got it today and I love it! I'm really into game music and that's there, and it doesn't only do 10 seconds of the music, like downloadable music. If I don't do downloadable music I do YouTube, but it takes a couple minutes more than this app. So, if you want to save time and listen to music, this app is for you!"
"September 29, 2017","enjoyed often"
"April 1, 2017","By far the best music player on the internet .High sound quality.When I can afford to buy premium I will.Thanks spotify."
"December 17, 2014","It seems like everyday that I get on this app some time of the day it appears that the app has no internet. I have to go to my wireless settings and turn them on and off to get the app to go online just to listen to my music. Wouldn't mind if this was just once in a while but its every day. Fix it."
"October 1, 2017","I love listening to My Little Pony, Michelle Creber, and High School Musical songs! 5 stars 100%!!!"
"October 2, 2017","I love Spotify! However, one of the things I don't like is that it plays Parental Guidance Songs when you're trying to play music for your 2-year-old cousin.😒 I still think it is a good app tho! 😃"
"August 9, 2016","Awesome alternative for Pandora. Switched because of some company views with which I didn't agree. Sorry I haven't switched before. The option to listen to one artist or mix with other artists and create your own ""station"" is way better than Pandora's. I wont be going back to them."
"December 14, 2016","I simply cannot find my groove with this app. As an artist who has my music on Spotify, it is very frustrating when you can't even find your own music. But sure enough, the same old big names pop up as usual. So sick of it. Will someone please do something different?"
"August 13, 2017","It's a great app this is child appropriate and you can make playlists. The only thing I don't like is if you don't pay for premium you can't pick your songs 🐼🐼"
"January 10, 2016","If you love hearing music, this is the PERFECT app for you!!! This app contains any music that you like, you can search it up, press play and done!!! This app is very easy and fun to use, but the only downside is that you have to have a specific age to use it..... other than that, this app is great! I definitely recommend it to everyone!!!!!!!😁😎💜🎵🎶🎼🎹🎸🎤🎧🎻"
"May 3, 2017","Spotify is the best, with lots more genre choices compared to other streaming audio! And easy to access as well."
"August 19, 2017","Love the music, but hate that I can not filter out explicit songs. We subscribed to the family package but are rethinking our decision. We do not like that we can not filter the music on our kid's tablets. We also have to be careful when playing music in the house. I have checked online and there are years worth of complaints about this same thing. Why hasn't Spotify fixed this?"
"July 18, 2017","I love this application due to the fact that they have a multitude of musical choices."
"November 15, 2014","Of all the music players (well its more like a radio) I've tried this is the most easy to control and has the best interface. With just a few clicks you'll be listening to your favorite music. It is just really simple and quick. I would really recommend that you at least give it a try. I use this on my HDX 7 device."
"April 22, 2016","Spotify is amazing. I love this app. You get to choose the music you want. You get to listen to the music you like. Spotify is the best music app to get because it will work offline if you sign up for premium. Spotify is an a!zing app.I recommend Spotify for those who love to choose their own music and listen to their favorite songs.👍😎💗"
"April 14, 2016","After subscribing to Spotify now for quite some time I just don't know what I would do without it!"
"May 3, 2017","Spotify is an amazing way to access music. As a paid subscriber the quality is excellent and there are so many albums available that I have always wanted to own. I would give it more stars if I could!"
"September 10, 2016","Awesome content, especially the variety of music from the days of my youth. Even one hit wonders songs can be heard. Absolutely one of the best music sites out there. Other then a skipped record every once in a while, excellent playback on all devices."
"September 20, 2017","You can play whole albums from a great many artists, in a pretty much a well designed app."
"January 4, 2016","I love spotify music. I have never searched for a song that I couldn't find and I love that I can add music to my list and listen to it anytime. I do reccommend the premium version though if you don't wanna deal with ads."
"October 30, 2017","Ughh just need simple music! Don't want to log in and keep up with another password"
"December 24, 2016","2morrow is Christmas!"
"June 21, 2017","Awesome! I love being able to listen to all my favorite songs! Also, I love when Spotify gives me suggestions of new artist that I might like."
"July 15, 2017","Title."
"May 22, 2016","I've used spirit for about two and a half years and it's awesome! I pay the monthly subscription and you're able to play all of your music from your personal playlists offline commercial free, without using data to stream music! Great app/service would highly recommend."
"January 18, 2016","I love the app, and have the paid version. But the app is not letting me login anymore. When I click &#34;login&#34; and type my log in information, it says there is already an account with that email. When I am trying to login, not create an account. Please fix this, I am paying for this so I want to 've able to use it."
"July 21, 2016","I love this app it got all ur music ....for every mood!!! Thank you!"
"August 4, 2017","Worthwhile to check old and newer albums for songs, add them to your list and play your list thru tablet, etc. I enjoy both the search and the playing. More songs than I have time to find. Good app."
"April 18, 2017","Spotify is amazing! The perfect app for a true music addictict & teacher: having so much music & any style at your fingertips is a music lover's dream come true! I use it constantly as a tool for learning new music for various performance situations, general study, teaching adult autistic students & private drum instruction as well as for sheer listening pleasure. Keep up the great work!"
"July 20, 2017","Another mistake that does not function well on my Kindle Fire."
"March 1, 2017","Great app"
"August 28, 2017","Great,music!"
"August 7, 2017","Love Spotify, hate that my favorite Dead Milkmen album isn't available. But that's not on Spotify, that's on their dumb label."
"January 25, 2017","Love Spotify. It has songs that I can't find anywhere else and allows me to create a playlist for each of my fan fiction stories. It's perfect."
"July 9, 2016","By far my favorite music streaming service. Love the 'make available offline' feature that lets you download albums/playlists/etc to listen to on the go without wasting data."
"June 27, 2017","I love this music provider it has varieties of music"
"August 17, 2017","we have Spotify family, well worth the money to get any song any time. no commercials/ adds. LOVe, LOve and LOVE"
"July 30, 2017","I love this app but the one thing I hate is to get more I have to pay for it otherwise I like the way it gives me the full album of the music I look for witch it's alsome"
"April 12, 2016","Way better than Pandora. With Pandora, you just listen to ""stations"". However, with Spotify, you can look up a song and play the whole song, free of charge. They do have very little ads. There is a premium option and that allows you to "" download"" the songs so you can listen to them off of data and Wi-Fi. It also removes the ads. However you have to pay for that feature."
"August 10, 2017","I just like this music app. better than Pandora. It just seems easier to use."
"November 30, 2015","Spotify is definitely my most used app; I use it multiple times a day. I pay for premium which is worth every penny to me. It's super easy to search for any song (even the most obscure), curate amazing playlists, and save songs you Shazam. The radio feature is way better than Pandora and their existing playlists in the Browse section are pretty decent. Also love that I can follow my friend's playlists."
"August 14, 2016","THIS app is great I play my favorite songs when a play games which is AWESOME only problem is sometimes it just turns on and off sometimes but other than that GREAT APP GUYS :D"
"September 12, 2014","I've enjoyed this app right from the beginning; wonderful selection and so user-friendly even those of us who frequently have ""blonde/southern/senior moments"" find it quite easy to create our own playlists no matter how eclectic our taste in music may be."
"November 26, 2015","Spotify is a great app in which you can choose what music you want to play it gives you trillions of choices on songs latest songs play station music, new songs like &#34;sorry&#34; by Justin Bieber, &#34;How deep is your love&#34; by Calvin harris , &#34;they working for it&#34; by skrillex and more &#34;a must get app from google. Get it free today 🙌🙌🙌"
"October 4, 2017","9.99 a month get all the music you’ll ever need"
"November 6, 2017","they have much expanded their base of available music over the last several years. the available quality of music is excellent, as well."
"August 4, 2017","I just love this app. I listen almost every day! Best music app out there."
"August 19, 2017","This is a good app let you listen to different kinds of music"
"August 12, 2017","Best music app ever!!! The best thing is, you get to listen to you favourite new songs FOR FREE!!!!!!! I truly love this app and I cannot stop listening music off this app!! Another thing that is amazing is that every song is FREE!!! Please download this app you will not regret it at all!!💕💕💕😍😍👌😆"
"May 29, 2016","I have been using this app for about 2 or 3 years now and I still choose this app over Pandora"
"August 16, 2017","I think you need to fix something about spotify.. whenever I'm playing and having the song on it will just randomly turn off... can you fix that 😐"
"May 17, 2017","It is very intelligently designed and I love this app, but I don't like the 30 minute adds every 10 minutes."
"November 11, 2017","Great app. Super easy to use and very little interruptions in the music play from ads. I would 100% recommend!"
"June 7, 2016","The only thing that annoys me, and I just don't understand, is why am I permitted, even with a free account, to play whatever specific songs I wish when using Spotify on my computer, yet with my smartphone I'm powerless to do so?  Seems rather inconsistent."
"July 8, 2017","If I had time is he making playlists and listening to music all day. For this reason, I am in love with spotify."
"September 25, 2015","I love spotify as a app way to my favorite pieces of music such as Bad Blood by Taylor Swift and don't forget to follow my play list Groovy Tunes by BabyBunnyMae! (ps I can't find out how to get premium so if you guys have any tips I would really appreciate it) Thank you to the makers of Spoify and I hope you guys will make more successful apps and games like Spotify Good Bye  Reports By Melody aka BabyBunnyMae"
"August 4, 2017","I enjoy Spotify because it lets me create playlists for my many moods and also creates playlists for me based on songs I like. It's a win/win!"
"August 5, 2015","I can't live without my Spotify. I love that not only can I listen to a full album if I want, but I can make my own playlists. PLUS play a radio station of a certain artist (just like the other radio app that rhymes with Fandora).  I pay the monthly fee and it's totally worth it.  Would recommend this for anyone!"
"March 6, 2017","great!"
"November 8, 2017","Good app luke Williams"
"April 30, 2015","Nice app. The only thing I have a problem is that it doesn't seem to sync with the desktop version? For example, some of the artists I follow do not have any albums shown under their profile (on the mobile version), but they're present (on the desktop version). Not sure why that is..."
"January 18, 2016","It just cannot get any better than this! Spotify Rules!!!"
"July 28, 2017","Love the app. It's got almost every song you can think of"
"October 13, 2017","Nice app. Once you understand how it works you can get anything you want."
"August 26, 2017","Works great! I have searched over 200 songs on Spotify and I found all but 3. I like that your music continues to play when you go into other apps and even when you turn off your device. The reason it is not 5 stars is because it stops playing randomly sometimes, and you can't play in an order you want. But other than that it is a great music app."
"August 4, 2017","It gives you all your favorite songs.I love this app!!!!"
"August 2, 2017","Fabulous! Easy to use, huge library going back to the twenties, very impressive. One short ad per 30 mns of undisturbed listening for free. Download to listen offline. Truly enjoying it."
"August 13, 2017","Spotify is a great jump if you're already enjoying Pandora. Spotify is Pandora but better."
"December 3, 2016","Great app! I used to blow all my cash on intunes. Not anymore!!! Spotify premium let's me take as much music I, want anywhere I want at a great monthly price. And they are adding more music as it goes! (So many of James glaway's albums) Sound quality is stellar!!!!!"
"September 17, 2015","Absolutely looooooooove this app. I listen to it in the morning, in the car, at work, before I go go bed. And what I love is that I get to create my own playlists. I don't have to worry about skipping songs or totally feeling my playlist and then.....blah! Nope. Never my issue. I even have playlists for my kids (edited versions of radio hits too!). I'm always recommending this app to everyone and have forced a few of my friends to get it!! Love it!"
"January 14, 2016","Good I like it because it has music any type you want and it still plays when you get out of the app like right now I'm listening to music from it while writing this."
"March 23, 2016","I had pandora thinking nothing could be better than this and thought maybe I'll give spotify a try. Believe me I was surprised, spotify had music that pandora didn't have yet! Also there were way more features on the free version that Pandora 's paid version didn't even have like how you can play certain songs on genres, the radios obviously has limits but it gives me way more control."
"May 6, 2016","Great variety of music, love that you can save songs and make playlists. Only negative so far is that the ads are significantly louder than the music at least 2/3 of the time, painfully so especially if you have on headphones."
"August 6, 2017","I love this app and I think it is awesome!💕💓💚❤💖💋💗😍"
"February 3, 2015","I've used Spotify for a long time now (I was a paying member for years), and I love being able to find just about any artist or song I want with no hassles. Sure, commercials are a drag, but it's not irritating enough to keep me away from this app. I use this all the time."
"September 20, 2017","Came to Spotify from Pandora. I love Spotify and will never leave!"
"November 12, 2016","I like it because it has many different songs and artists but it also has its perks but it is mostly amazing because when you are on trips its fun to listen to this instead of the radio"
"September 29, 2014","Spotify is definitely my new favorite music app. I love how organized it all is and how you are able to create and name your own personal playlists. It is also up to date with some of the newer music, yet still has some of the older, still good music. I love the variety of bands and artists it provides and the organization offered. So if you haven't thought of it yet, Spotify is the app to get for playing music. :)"
"December 23, 2015","You can get WiFi free trial. It plays any songs you want even if you have a band and know one knows about it post a video on social media or just enter the name because I found my song on it and know one knows I even sing so it is awesome and remember that you can just play songs and not video ........... 5 stars ............. oh and I have a talk show haha you can talk about why thing that is why I laugh .....5stars"
"February 22, 2015","Syncs to all devices easily. Intuitive design makes it easy to create playlists and organize your music. I like their radio function better than pandora, less repetition of liked songs. Only unable to find a very few artists. Coming from the school of record digging and hunting, this makes underground music almost TOO easy to find! A whole new school and Spotify is the best way to listen to music in the modern world."
"October 13, 2016","Great place to listen to music."
"September 8, 2017","If you want on-demand music listening, nothing really beats Spotify, so I had to get this! Still learning the user interface, but it does what I need and much more."
"October 19, 2017","Its super good! You can choose songs and download some and not have to use limited skips or brekad like Pandora. You also can control what your listening. I just wish their were less adds. Otherwise, great app! I strongly recommend it!"
"August 26, 2017","I am a convert from Pandora. I listen to new age music to sleep and the constant commercials got to be irritating...and I didn't want to pay extra just for sleep music. With Spotify and my prime membership I have never had a commercial, listen to the station I like, select tracks I like and download them so I can listen offline in a cabin in the woods or anywhere I want to be lulled back to sleep. Plus online I hear new stuff on the station I chose to expand my playlist. Like the fact that it all meshes with my kindle fire so easily."
"July 26, 2017","A great app that provides everything it promises!!"
"July 4, 2017","Enjoyable music and its always available thanks"
"June 24, 2017","Our Think Tank came to a conclusive decision that this music component had both quantity and quality and would recommend it on pure honesty DNO! Research Analyst"
"June 7, 2017","Love it! Especially like the similar bands feature helps in expanding and experiencing other musical interpretations."
"July 30, 2017","Great"
"June 2, 2015","An almost exact clone of the PC version, and that's a good thing. One added feature is that it gives me control over the Spotify app on my PS3 and PS4. Has proven invaluable ever since I discovered that feature, making searching and browsing that much more intuitive and seemless."
"May 14, 2017","Great, never thought I would say this but I'm starting to like it better than iheart"
"October 24, 2017","It's not as good as thru my PS3,but at least I got it mobile now,"
"August 16, 2017","Here I have a paradise of all the songs I love, and your dream of music will come true if you get Premium! ;)"
"September 4, 2017","It's unbelievably wonderful. A person can't have wider tastes in music than I do, and 98% of the time, it's on Spotify.  Thanks. Professional musician and teacher Greg"
"June 20, 2017","Fine..need to show lyrics..."
"June 30, 2015","Honestly, I use this app everyday and have yet to be disappointed. Granted the ads can be annoying, but they're not as frequent as you'd think they should be for a free app, and adds are removable when upgrading to the paid version. To date, I've had no issues with this app, so I love it."
"January 13, 2016","I have used Spotify for a long time on my phone, tablet & computer. Its a great way to have tons of music at your fingertips without having to spend oodles of money. I use their free subscription, which works for me as the ads are minimal and not very frequent. I highly recommend Spotify over other music streaming apps"
"July 22, 2017","Great and easy way to find and listen to music. Love the Daily Mix."
"October 13, 2017","I've been using Spotify for years. Love it! I can create my own playlists, listen to other playlists, find new music, get notified when my favorite artists are playing nearby, and listen to stations created around an artist or genre. It's even linked with Shazam! Add a subwoofer and speakers...off ya go!"
"May 28, 2017","I like this music app! It lets you create your own play lists with any music you want and like. The only thing I don't like about this app is that they make you pay to listen to music without WiFi."
"September 18, 2017","Has a nice site, much to do on it. A wide variety of sounds."
"August 29, 2016","It's a great music app that allows you to find and listen to with ease. The free version offer's plenty (as long as you have an Internet connection) with ad's not being repetitive. You like music, it's a no brainer you'll enjoy this app."
"March 29, 2017","Amazing app, has become a daily routine of using it. Hate the adverts so decided to pay monthly and love the fact that you can download the music offline and also use the account on multiple platforms and devices."
"September 6, 2016","How could anyone not like spotify?"
"December 27, 2014","Great except for not being able to move songs up or down in play lists (or see play times) from android tablets. Seems odd that these features work with my old windows 7 laptop but are not avaliable with a new tablet or phone? Would be 5 stars if I did not need to keep using my laptop to adjust my playlists:-( Amazon music play lists work fine across all my devices."
"October 1, 2016","This is the best music app I have ever downloaded :)"
"July 19, 2017","Couldn't live without Spotify!! I use it at least once a day!"
"December 30, 2015","I love spotify. You can make your own play lists and browse others play lists also. If you purchase premium you can download the music and enjoy ad - free listening. The app runs smoothly. One thing I would suggest doing is stopping the music after a few hours because sometimes I will fall asleep with music on and wake up to it playing"
"April 19, 2017","I love this app. It let's me choose what songs or artists I want and I can go to radio and broadcasts."
"January 20, 2017","Okay!"
"May 27, 2017","I'm almost on spotify enough to say this app is worth it I love the music options and play list I find and if you want something different it's not hard to listen to New music and discover something you haven't already heard before"
"May 29, 2015","Had been using Pandora and thought I would give this a try. I still use Pandora yet I like how Spotify will play the artist you want to hear through a shuffled playlist."
"May 4, 2017","Great app...love the music!"
"July 27, 2017","Love Spotify!"
"July 26, 2016","Just got started with this and believe will enjoy it."
"September 2, 2017","It is great when by clicking you just find whatever you want or even you had liked when you were kid. It wonderful."
"April 29, 2017","I like very much. User friendly! Thanks"
"January 12, 2017","Not happy about the porn hub advertisements that my daughter just saw on spotify. Brand new tablet, the first app we downloaded was spotify and when an ad came on, it was an ad for open hub."
"February 4, 2016","I love Spotify and feel as though I couldn't live without it at this point. It's $10 a month and I don't even notice bc it gets taken out of my checking account. No paying $1.29 per song, since you always have unlimited access to millions of songs and albums. I love being able to make fun playlists too! And spotifys playlists they offer are pretty good too, in my opinion."
"June 12, 2017","This is a awesome app.I can play whatever music I want,and still not have to pay anything!only that it gives me adds to go premium to get rid of them.still good though!"
"September 22, 2017","I love using Spotify. Its easy to use and I find different kinds of music all the time."
"December 5, 2016","meh"
"September 20, 2017","I use spotify constantly, definitely worth getting premium too"
"May 4, 2017","BEST THING EVER NOW THIS APP LETS U HER ANY SONG U WANT INSTEAD OF YOUTUBE XD"
"May 3, 2017","Love it, love it, love it! Best music app ever! I have used it everyday for 3 years now!"
"March 18, 2016","I like that I can create my own playlists, but the commercial interruptions every half hour are too much. Plus you have to pay a monthly fee in order to be able to listen to music offline."
"April 17, 2015","A friend at work turned me into this. Amazing free app! Love the genres it offers. Has me listening to artists I've never heard of and loving them. If you like most types of music this is a great app. If you're a fan whose open to new listening experiences, you'll find it so valuable you'll want to install it on every device you have and never be without one so you can listen all the time!!"
"June 4, 2016","I love being able to make my own play list as well as listening to streaming of the genres I enjoy. Awesome selections that I'm sure will continue to grow."
"March 6, 2017","Honesty premium is worth it great app"
"November 26, 2016","Great way to listen to music, a lot of great music choices. A little buggy at times; biggest annoyance is when the ""up next"" queue gets cleared, usually if going from one suc WiFi source to another."
"September 29, 2015","Very different from Pandora, I love the variety of how much SPECIFIC music you can find and listen to instead of shuffled songs you don't even care about when wanting to listen to a specific artist."
"October 15, 2017","I love Spotify. I can listen to anything I want when I want. The app has never given me any problems."
"March 10, 2017","This is a great app"
"May 29, 2017","I love spotify one of the better sites tovdown load music unfortunately for a fee😕"
"October 25, 2015","The spotify app is great for listening to music. Some of the problems I am having are that when I'm on YouTube, spotify will randomly start playing without the app being open. Also, you only get a limited amount of skips if you don't have premium, and you can't choose which song to play."
"June 2, 2017","This app is SO useful!! I listen to music all the time!! The only criticism I can give is that you can't listen to it withoutwifi!!!!i"
"September 19, 2017","Excelente"
"August 7, 2017","Best music app I've used yet. Keep it up"
"November 25, 2016","Millions upon millions of songs at my fingertips is simply better than sex, but not cookies, egg too being, or pernil."
"August 11, 2017","Plays good music. Better then I exepted"
"October 31, 2017","Good amount of music to chose from, but has commercials."
"January 17, 2016","speaks for itself"
"May 31, 2016","As long as your okay with a couple of adds, your good. I mean, your getting unlimited free songs and if youj watch one add, the next half hour is add free. I definitely suggested this app because you can listen to any don't, even the brand new ones, and it has way more options that amazon music."
"July 29, 2017","Best music app ever!!!😍"
"August 29, 2016","This app is awesome!!!!! I can listen to music online, which is one part of the downside. But if you are on one album you can listen even offline until that album is done playing!!!!"
"July 16, 2017","I can listen to music with and witought"
"October 1, 2015","Perfect, free, and you have the choice of what you want to play"
"August 24, 2016","Love it and its free"
"July 30, 2017","I love 💘 this so much IT HAS ALL THE SONGS I LOVE😁😁😁😁😁YOU NEED TO DOWNS OF THIS"
"March 2, 2017","I really liked Spotify. But now it's just not keeping up. The app is great, but the content not so much."
"August 11, 2017","Needs WiFi or data but other than that this is a great app. I can listen to all of my favorite music and more. I love this app. This is a must download, I am in love with this app.💖💖"
"October 24, 2017","Love , awesome app so glad my friend told me about this!!!"
"October 18, 2017","Sad, worked twice then got all crunchy with audio, barely hear any voices from podcast. So frustrating; and, yes, tried on multiple devices with same result. Painful."
"August 2, 2014","Excellent app. I used to use songza, but it became unavailable where I live, but was happy enough to find spotify. Great variety os playlists, national or international, great sound quality, shows you what songs are in the playlist. The premium version is great also, letting you choose exactly what song you want to listen to, instead of going random on to playlist and waiting for it to show up. It also lets you mark some songs as ""available offline"", so you can listen to your favorite songs anytime at all."
"August 29, 2017","I like the suggestions feature of Spotify, it has exposed me to music that otherwise I would have not ever listened to. However, their selection is not even close to include all genres and artists"
"May 4, 2017","fantastic service - i use the regular and listen to the music and commercials - it doesn't bother me that they have commercials. it keeps my mind of running or gardening --"
"December 11, 2016","Love my Spotify, will never be without it again. I found lots of oldies and some things I thought were out of production. Very happy with the function of this app also. Starbuck got my hooked with a 3 month free membership."
"January 24, 2015","I love this app because u can't find it anywhere else ( meaning an app like this.) But when I want to listen to it offline it says go to premium and I can't find it but other wise really good."
"June 7, 2016","I love this app! I've been using it for the past 6 months, and it's amazing. I would have to say that the downside to this app is that if you don't have the premium account, then you can't listen to what ever song you want. Also, you can't listen offline unless you have premium. Other than that, I would recommend this app Ito everyone"
"March 3, 2016","Spotify is everything Pandora, I-Heart, and rest are lacking. You have total control of a huge music library. No thumbing up & down. Listen to what you want. Make your own playlists. Once you learn to navigate Spotify, you'll love it!"
"October 24, 2017","You have to have internet unless you want to be a member and pay a $10 fee monthly which is not fun if you don't have a credit/debt card. But other than that this app is great I come home and get to listen to all my favorite songs."
"September 1, 2017","Does what it's supposed to do. I use it on my Amazon Fire HD8 and it works great."
"August 13, 2017","Premium is the best! I'm in and out of coverage areas and NEVER without music."
"August 28, 2016","I love this app as far as playing single tracks, albums, and artists, however the radio feature is a bit basic. If the devs were to add an option to make a radio based off of selected artists this app would probably beat any paid radio app competitiom"
"July 8, 2016","I have the best music from 70s to now build your playlists and follow your favorites and discover the best music you can ever find using all the smart radios and recommended playlists. Well worth the ten a month to have unlimited music at your fingertips and saved to your library for listening on the go."
"January 14, 2017","Any and every song you can think of. I've re-discovered my old 60's music and jazz fusion. Love that you can stream the music off-line on my phone and take it with me."
"July 26, 2017","This is the only thing I use now for music! It has unlimited skips for ipad/kindle fire/laptop so it is perfect. It's browsing/radio modes are amazing for finding new songs. You can create and share playlists, and collaborate with all different people to discover new artists and music. All in all, it is the perfect app for music. I recommend 100%!"
"October 21, 2015","Spotify is an amazing app that is easy to use and premium is the best, because you can save songs with wifi and later you can view them when your not connected to wifi or data. Spotify is a great music app for all music lovers. It is very easy to personalise and save songs to your play lists. Highly recommend."
"January 18, 2017","Spotify is a must have for our household. The music selection is amazing. The app is so easy to use that my 3 year old can navigate it to find the playlist I made for her. love this."
"November 22, 2016","Love listening to Spotify. Easy to set up Log in and use."
"September 16, 2015","Pros: -It works on my Kindle -Plenty of playlists to choose from -Choose the music you want to listen to"
"April 12, 2017","Ever since the most recent update I've not been able to add songs to playlists and or que up a song. I love using Spotify so please fix this."
"October 3, 2017","Much better than Pandora.. Many, many local bands post to it."
"August 1, 2017","The best money I spend each month is my Spotify subscription. I LOVE IT!"
"February 6, 2016","Really like! I play my husbands favorite John Prine album when completing his wound care which makes it enjoyable for him. I listen to my favorite music like Newsong which I had a hard time finding until Spotify!"
"July 6, 2017","Easy to process the music I like."
"June 15, 2016","I love my Amazon Music! BUT this is so much easier to use! I continue to have MP3 download issues with my Amazon. BUT, again, Spotify is great!"
"May 20, 2017","Great app, good service, and excellent music/audio selections. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
"August 5, 2017","best down load ever. Nice selection to pick from"
"May 11, 2017","This is a revolution. In the good and in the bad... all the music you want with 120 euro/year. Plus some killer features such as personalised playlists proposed by the app."
"February 22, 2015","working just fine--recent add of app on a recently purchased Nexus 7---so glad I can listen off-line with my premium account, and as a background to other things I do on my tablet. Spotify is a frill on a small income, but well worth it for what it offers."
"October 24, 2017","i wish we could make single play list cause all the songs are in a bunch and on ps4 its not like that"
"January 6, 2016","If you ask me 15 dollars a month and practicly any song you want is an amazing deal I have hundreds of songs it's amazing"
"October 13, 2017","Enjoy the wide variety of music. There is music for every ones taste."
"July 19, 2017","Really nice, free music all the latest ""Hits""..."
"May 23, 2017","Great place to listen to all the music you like."
"January 15, 2017","Ok"
"June 30, 2016","Works great on my Blackberry"
"August 5, 2017","Best thing ever"
"November 19, 2014","Wow all I can say is wow I can find all the music I want I can find all the band's and all the artist I wanna listen too.I think this app is just like pandora.I got this app because I was bored because all my friends and my sister had too go to school but I was sick and I used this app for 2 whole hours and still wasn't bored.Great if you are bored so plz get this app especially good If you like music.ð"
"August 12, 2017","Unfortunately Spotify has not updated their fire app because it has less options than your phone app. It's my favorite streaming service but through the firestick it's not up to par with the mobile app at all. Maybe going back to Pandora their firestick app is better..."
"October 18, 2014","I love this app !!! It gives me the type of music I love to hear and the variety is really awesome !!! I would recommend the app to any true music lover !!! Great app keep up the good work !!! Love it even more because it is free ;-) !!!"
"September 21, 2017","Everyday user... download via Google Play, but same thing."
"August 20, 2017","I am listening to music I haven't heard in years. So far it is a great memory weekend with new speakers and great sounds from the past."
"February 11, 2017","This service has great potential to be amazing, but streaming music is a nightmare sometimes. Even with an excellent connection and new device, the app is obnoxiously buggy. That, and they get commercial happy if you don't make your payment. They're not even relevant commercials! Just background noise to annoy you into buying their subscription!"
"February 12, 2016","Great! I can get music I could get on Amazon Music and iTunes. The only thing I don't like about it, is you can't choose what song you want to listen to. If you have say, 5 songs on a playlist you created, click shuffle play, you can listen to those 5 songs. Awesome. But it also plays &#34;recommended songs&#34; or songs from the album you got your chosen songs from!"
"October 30, 2014","I love the new interface that Spotify has designed with their mobile apps - mostly very intuitive and genuinely beautiful with their use of album art and photos in the backgrounds. The way the now playing panel appears in the notification pull down is gorgeous and rounds out a great music listening experience on my Kindle. I just wish it were caught up to whatever Amazon's security standards are because the pop up warning prior to opening it every time is a tad bit annoying."
"August 4, 2017","Its either you or the music!! As long as you of premium of don't mind ads this app is totally WICKED TO THE CORE!! Anyone who lives for music should totally understand!!!"
"September 3, 2017","Spotify is the most user friendly online music app out there. Has all the features I was looking for, as well as much, much more. I've been with Spotify for a couple of months now, and continue to discover new capabilities."
"March 11, 2017","One of the best way to organize and listen to your music available anywhere."
"August 18, 2017","This all is really good 👍. Does its job."
"June 7, 2017","It is cool and I could listen to Spotify all I want! And if I go on premium it is rad!!!! It may have some annoying ads, but they can give you 30 min. Of free ads. If you are reading this well get the app!!!"
"July 1, 2017","Spotify has tons of options, great source of music."
"September 13, 2017","Great for a free station, not too many or too long ads"
"October 10, 2017","Great for when you don't know what to listen to! Having 1000+ albums doesn't always cut it."
"August 6, 2017","Got it because can't play Amazon Prime on my Blackberry. Great selection of music, well curated playlists, and easy to navigate. Winner winner chicken dinner!"
"November 11, 2016","I love Spotify! Especially this version! The app itself has a simple layout and is easy to use. I'm still not 100% used to my kindle seeing as I am more accustomed to Apple devices, but this app is great. I love how unlike on the phone version, you can play any song at any time."
"March 16, 2015","Love it. Huge selection of rock/blues and country/rock artists. Don't know about alt pop or rap/hiphop styles, but great for my tastes. 1st streaming player that doesn't buffer and stutter with my crappy low speed DSL service. If you want Spotify Pro, watch for sales/promos."
"July 12, 2016","The best musical library on the web.."
"July 6, 2017","Love this app would recommend it and have recommended it"
"September 18, 2017","Easy to manage, easy to make playlist."
"June 20, 2017","Lots of ads, very little good music, constantly picking songs for my playlist that don't match and suck"
"October 1, 2016","Works"
"January 13, 2016","I believe this app is the best for music because it has a easy to use menu and has all the songs you want. However I downloaded this app on my galaxy s6 and I can only shuffle music. I can not choose one song I have to shuffle and hope I get lucky. I would very appreciate it if this was fixed. Otherwise it is a great app."
"August 27, 2017","I enjoy the app for convenience and variety"
"June 6, 2017","Listening to Spotify and getting the great little trails of music to listen. Some I have forgotten or mainly never heard. Great for working out, walking, bike riding. Justing sitting with friends in backyard. Having people ask you what are we listening to."
"September 16, 2016","The music selection is amazing! The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't give you an option for lyrics on any songs."
"December 24, 2016","I love Spotify. I pay for the premium and its definitely worth it. 100% better than Pandora."
"September 7, 2017","Listen to my Christian radio all the time."
"August 21, 2017","Good"
"May 23, 2017","I'd give it 5 stars, but only giving 4 because they don't always have the music you want. Like, I'll go to add a particular song to my playlist, but Spotify doesn't have it. It's annoying, but other than that, it's a pretty good music service."
"November 11, 2017","Love Spotify!! Couldn't live without my music!!"
"June 15, 2017","My favorite way to stream music. I love how you can save all your songs for when you don't have service."
"October 31, 2017","Because it is awesome: it has thousands of good songs and already made playlists for certand events, its so cool and awesome Because it is kinda awesome: it only has shuffle and a certand amount of skios"
"July 14, 2017","I love this app soi much I can play all the Logan Paul songs I want I love it so much I hope this app hits it big!!!!!😍💖💖💖💙💚💙💙✌"
"September 2, 2017","Tons of music, easy to use, just great."
"April 21, 2017","Love Spotify ! Stays up to date with music and over all easy access!"
"October 11, 2017","Obtained viruses shortly after install."
"July 22, 2017","MUCH BETTER THAN PANDORA!!! I get to load my songs and play the songs that I want, when I want to....not so with Pandora."
"April 19, 2017","I love this app. It's fun and easy to use. I would definitely recommend it! :)"
"August 6, 2017","You can look up just about any artist you want. its easy to use. Good interface."
"December 25, 2014","I was using this at the beginning of the year and is where I listen to all my music but the recent update makes it glitch and now I can't access my music hopefully ya can fix that soon"
"March 21, 2016","I use this app for everything. I teach a spin class and keep my classes fresh with new selections thanks to spotify. Never spent my money on something more worth it. Whether I'm working out, teaching spin, or even in my headset when I'm 65 ft in the air cutting trees! Spotify is the app for all your music wants!!"
"January 5, 2016","I can't get enough of this app! I listen to it at dinner, while I read, and even while I sleep. Easy to use and an incredible selection to meet all of your music interests and needs!"
"May 9, 2015","I love Spotify Music App! I can find the artists I want to hear and listen to full songs and albums. Great for me....could be Great for you."
"August 4, 2017","Better then Pandora"
"June 28, 2017","Only problem is there are no radio versions. I LOVE it otherwise!!!"
"February 8, 2016","I entirely love this app! I have it on my iPhone and when I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire, it took it to another level! I can select any song I want, whenever. On my iPhone I cannot do that unless I upgrade to premium but, on my Kindle Fire I can without the upgrade and that's what I love overall. I cannot find any faults whatsoever on Spotify on Kindle. Well recommended! &#60;3333"
"June 16, 2017","Love it"
"June 4, 2017","I love being able to play spotify through Alexa! I just tell her what I want to hear."
"August 19, 2017","My daughter uses this, she likes it."
"October 22, 2015","This is just an average game, no longer have on the kindle. Had it for my 8 year old son. But no longer have again. Giving 3 because really its just average, but a free application."
"September 19, 2016","I love how you can find old songs you haven't heard in a long time and create a playlist so you can listen to them anytime! I now have my husband and son both hooked!  Very easy to find songs, to create play lists, and to save the songs as well."
"August 20, 2017","A must have app for music lovers. An improvement could be made to radio stations created from playlists. They are not as diversified as the playlists themselves."
"October 21, 2017","Can't recommend enough. Use it every day..."
"September 27, 2017","Fantastic Music service// with music options verying from listening directly to desired artists, or starting an artist/song/album radio and listening to accurately recommended similar artists, its a great service."
"August 31, 2017","Excellent app to listen to music!"
"August 3, 2015","Just don't know how to up grade it."
"August 5, 2017","While Spotify has great features, settings, playlists, and music you want to listen to, it does not play well with all file types, or folders. Still a good app."
"September 2, 2015","Love it. Don't particularly care for the ads, but it's a great way to accumulate the greatest music ever made, the 80's."
"September 8, 2017","Sorry, but I don't think it's that great."
"May 21, 2017","its ok"
"May 27, 2015","I love this app! I had a party and didnt need to worry about music at all. The best part was that if someone had a request it was here!"
"November 11, 2017","This is the best app cuz it has all the songs i love"
"August 16, 2017","Awesome and good"
"June 26, 2017","Great app for songs to listen to. Spotify for life."
"October 9, 2016","The app is one of the better (both functionally and looking) apps that I've seen and although the available music is huge, there are a surprising number of tracks not available. I was hoping that Spotify could replace other apps and ripped CDs, but it doesn't for me."
"October 26, 2017","It plays the music you select."
"August 11, 2017","Every song you could ever want love it and I got premium so definitely get that"
"April 29, 2016","I adore spotify I wake up to it 3:am when I'm getting ready for work. When i leave the house I listen to at work and when I return home. I love the fact that you can pull up all the music no matter what year, type, fast or slow. I have my own music library."
"November 5, 2015","I used to love this app but the new update makes me sad. I can only shuffle to play songs, there are way more commercials and it always tells me I'm not connected to the Internet when I really am. These are all reasons I left pandora and came to spotify."
"July 12, 2017","Love spotify with all my heart. The best way to listen to music by FAR. Highly recommend and will never go back to Soundcloud or Apple music. Spotify is the future and the best."
"June 24, 2017","Music Spotify and Amazon Music on my Passport"
"June 12, 2016","Apparently you need spotify premium to download"
"April 7, 2017","I pay for premium and we luv it. It's really no different then Music on Apple. Although we are iPhone users our preference is Spotify. No real reason just a preference."
"May 24, 2017","Enjoy the serserlecton of music that's available."
"August 29, 2017","My favorite music app"
"November 11, 2017","Just love and adore this app"
"July 17, 2017","Easy to use. Portability is great I like it"
"December 22, 2016","Spotify + Amazon Echo = frictionless musical bliss. Spotify is by far the best interface for curation and discovery. Alexa helps you enjoy all your playlists and stations without being tethered to a phone or tablet. Especially great for moms, people who paint/cook/clean/build, and for anyone who has always wanted a personal DJ."
"June 16, 2017","Just learning how to navigate the website."
"July 31, 2014","To start, I was impressed with the free service. The music quality was pretty good. But the music selection was amazing! Just about everything I want is here. So, I figured &#34;sure, why not go for the premium service?&#34; The quality is even better AND now I can remotely control my tablet (hooked up to my sound system) with my cell phone! The first month is free. Highly recommended, folks. Go for it!"
"August 6, 2017","The best $9.95 a month I've ever spent. I love it !"
"March 31, 2017","Great"
"June 21, 2017","I love spotify but I would like to be able to download my music"
"August 11, 2017","Its crap. I listen to it on a kindle. I can't listen to it anywhere other than my house. It sucks."
"January 23, 2017","App is adequate and works just fine for my needs with my spotify account"
"April 11, 2017","I love spotify, it is the best way to enjoy music, especially the tablet version because you can select songs. Thank you"
"August 23, 2017","Love it. Have found every song and or artist I have looked for. I play the music I love and set my radio stations and libraries."
"November 15, 2014","This app is a million times better because on I heart radio they dont play music that you want example you want something by Katy Perry the first song that they play is by Katy Perry the second song is by like Taylor Swift or Justin Beiber. With Spotify is different because you can look by the artist album to know which song you like Spotify is awesome you should really download this app :)"
"March 18, 2015","I read constantly and I always look for the free music and comedy apps that will &#34;follow&#34; me as I jump from one to the other. I was a little surprised how many don't, or have my music genres. Spotify Music has it all. With almost 2,000 reviews there's not much I can add that hasn't been written. LOVE, LOVE LOVE IT!!"
"July 28, 2017","Nice I like it"
"May 30, 2016","This is amazing so excited I have spotlight on my tablet now, have it on my laptop an PlayStation AMAZING app eventually you may come across an album or song that is still in verification by the artist but those usually take less than a week my advice: get this if you want free unlimited music"
"July 30, 2016","Pro . Free music . Good songs to choose . Build your dream Pandora station . Well organized playlist . Easy to use Con . Can't choose a song on phone unless you have . Spotify premium . can't play music offline unless you purchase for Spotify premium"
"May 16, 2015","This app inspirses me.When I first got it I didn't like it but when I got it on my tablet,I was the best music app ever plz get it.Im not saying this cause they told me too I love this app,and I hope u will too.Get this everything is free and need no Wi-Fi.You will love this app.Rate 5 stars 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀"
"February 23, 2015","The app is good, but soon after downloading it mysteriously baloons up from the listed 20 MB to 60-100 after downloading, even if you don't download anything, which is annoying if you're trying to save space. Other music apps don't do this."
"March 10, 2015","Spotify is an amazing app. It has all the songs I can think of. Even if I forget the title of a song I can just type in a few lyrics of the song, and it'll pop up for me to listen to. Spotify is amazing and without music there isn't life is what I say."
"June 11, 2015","I pay 10$ a month for the premium and I must say it's worth it. I can download music and listen to it whenever and wherever I am. There is no limit to the amount of music I can have or the playlists. I can share my music with friends or keep my playlist hidden for my own personal use. I love this app."
"July 17, 2017","Liked it - use it for kids songs"
"March 21, 2016","Oh my gosh this music app Spotify is so good! It gives you 1 week trial for Spotify premium.  And it gives you 30 minutes of free ad music!  Not like Pandora or iHeartRadio but you can add songs to your own Spotify library and click songs and it'll be there all tied up in a present for you!  I reccomend this 9 trillion stars if I could do it download now!"
"August 26, 2017","Great source for all music!"
"December 30, 2016","No matter what you like, you will find it. Fantastic selection of music. 🎵🎶🎻🎹🎹🎷🎺🎸"
"April 14, 2016","God damn this app is great and amazing great app u gote  Going here way more music than u think 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎"
"January 5, 2017","This is the best, especially for those of us that are computor slow. I have never requested a song that Spotify could not supply. It easy to make and arrange music lists..I can't compliment it enough..The perodic up grades simply make it better. I believe I have sold a few subscriptions just as my son sold it to me."
"August 6, 2015","Gave '4' stars only because, It wont change album artwork anymore as you listen. But, it is a good music app, does seem to be periodic skip's in music, That's why I'm a little hesitant to go premium"
"August 14, 2017","So far loving this app"
"February 16, 2016","It has a wide range of music for all ages and tastes."
"June 16, 2017","Fire Stick TV product. Something to add"
"October 21, 2017","love this app so fun"
"April 13, 2016","my kids download it and they love it."

"May 9, 2017","Awesome app and I 😁 Spotify and it brightens my day and always gives a artist full ablum people reading this download this and make an account"
"March 23, 2016","Love the playlists that are always available."
"June 16, 2017","Great way to have music at fingertips."
"August 28, 2017","Very good App. The only aspect of this I wish was different was the ability to download your favorite music when traveling as wifi is spotty depending on location."
"September 19, 2017","perfect download music"
"September 20, 2016","I like that I'm able to turn my phone screen off and save some battery usage while enjoying a lot of my favorite songs..I also enjoy the option of being able to multi-task..read emails/news articles, surf the internet, check weather while still enjoying some music.."
"August 4, 2017","I don't like it. It's not what it said it would be, A Free App."
"August 23, 2016","I've used Spotify ever since it came out years ago to stream music while in the car or on my motorcycle. I rarely ever even listen to the radio anymore. The ability to custom build playlists or search through other people's playlist is awesome. Being able to follow artists' pages is great for keeping up with new releases. I'd be lost without this app."
"March 24, 2017","I love spotlight I can choose literally any song I want."
"June 16, 2017","Its so good for a long road trip"
"June 10, 2017","Any kind of music for the mood I'm in."
"December 7, 2014","I absolutely love Spotify. There's only one issue that I have and it's so worthless it doesn't even deserve to have a star taken off, but how come on the website it says that Premium's only for the phone and my Kindle should have it automatically? My Kindle is able to skip songs and choose any song but it has ads and I can't play My Songs music offline."
"July 21, 2017","Not really with all the cursing in songs when I'm with my kids. Wish there was a switch to turn off the profanity when I'm with them in the car."
"August 24, 2017","Good choice of music"
"June 16, 2017","There great"
"January 4, 2017","i really enjoy this app. i use it on a kindle fire and have no problems. downloads quickly, lots to choose from, and i only hear songs i love."
"January 9, 2015","I love this app. It's works very well and when I'm bored i just go on this app and listen. There's just one problem. Sometimes when I look at the music that i got it crashes and then I can never get back on app. I keep downloading it over and over and over and over and over again . It gets very frustrating. Is it possible if you can fix that?"
"May 29, 2017","A wider variety😂💚"
"November 25, 2014","Only one flaw with this on the kindle version vs. the app on my android tablet is that it will look like you have added a song/saved a song but it does not in fact save at all. I've had to go back and forth from my droid to kindle.  This is basically exactly like google play and cost the same to go add free."
"March 20, 2017","Such a good way to listen to tunes. My favorite app!"
"May 18, 2017","any song i need is a click away, i use it to DJ with and also listen to my play list everyday"
"October 12, 2015","Sporting is a great app. I love it because u can search up the sespific song u want, and it plays it. Iheart radio is not the best cause u can't play the sespific song u want so ya. I gave it only 4 stars cause... IT DOESNT HAVE TAYLOR SWIFT!!! Sad. Thx for reading!!"
"February 14, 2015","So, I've tried a lot of different music apps though out the last year and spotify is the best, you can search for any song or artists you want, you can also make playlist of your favorite songs and even share the them to your social media accounts, I would recommend spotify to anyone who wants a music app that gives you exactly what you want, plus more."
"October 15, 2017","Pricey but great"
"September 19, 2017","Always excellent music on Spotify Music. So artists I couldn't find on other sites."
"April 30, 2017","Perfect for really any device! Has lots of playlist that you can discover and hear new music. You can even make your own playlist and share it with others!"
"October 22, 2017","it Is nice"
"October 18, 2017","Excellent choice"
"March 20, 2017","Never have a problem streaming my music though here"
"July 23, 2015","The music is, of course, great, but my biggest surprise and delight is under ""Word"", when you browse. A treasure-trove of spoken-word delights, from audio books (complete books!), language tutoring programs, poetry, short stories, guided meditations. It's an unexpected pleasure which I'm having lots of fun exploring."
"April 29, 2017","I really use this app lots works fine with my phones."
"July 22, 2017","I love listening to music on spotify but there's a glitch that makes some of the ads not load and you can't play music because the ads not done"
"September 23, 2017","I love Spotify!"
"July 13, 2017","I love it so much!!! Iistening to right now!!!!💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖👌👌👌💘💘👌💘👌💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💥💥💥🎶🎶💥☺🎶💥💥🎶💥💥🎶💥🎶💥"
"March 22, 2017","If you don't pay for Spotify premium I feel bad for you."
"January 1, 2015","I like that different genres that spotify offers. Also they songs that are playing are a mix of some old ones that I have heard before and some new ones that I have never heard. There are artist that I never heard before and that gives me more people to add to my library."
"October 3, 2017","so many apps...."
"August 7, 2015","Amazing but ...... it needs more music from an older era take We As Human for example I love their music but their older music is not on spotify and it just so happens that the one album from them that is my favorit is not their. Now I'm give you five stars spotify because you've blown me away with your music selection but I am willing to down grade spotify if they don't fix their problems."
"January 28, 2016","Great app for music just wished it didn't cost $9.99 a month after the first 3 months that are $.99."
"April 18, 2016","Love the fact that I can listen to a whole track of my favorite artist. However I personally love Iheartradio better. 😕"
"July 21, 2017","I think it's great.And it' free."
"March 2, 2016","Love it...much more user friendly than Pandora"
"August 4, 2017","It is hard to cancel subscription. Spotify has no contact number in case you need customer service. The link to change password doesn't work."
"April 25, 2017","Let's me listen to any music I want to listen to."
"September 11, 2015","I really used to love this app. It was my go-to for music. Then something terrible happened. Now I can't listen to what I want when I want. Now it plays suggested songs on shuffle instead of what I want to listen to. And let's face it, thats what Pandora is for."
"August 28, 2017","They have a good selection of opera, and classical songs. The commercials are blearingly loud and should be tailored for those who listen to classical music. Better selection than Amazon prime."
"August 21, 2017","Great app, I'm very happy!"
"September 1, 2017","works great!"
"September 17, 2017","Too many ads"
"April 3, 2017","Tell's you if the song is explicit. Tells you the most popular artists on Spotify. (In my opinion, I think it is David Bowie.)  😃 Genius! 😃"
"August 28, 2017","best music app"
"July 10, 2017","Need more Hawaiian music (past & present)"
"August 25, 2017","€£¥₩ ♤♡◇♧☆☆☆¿"
"June 25, 2017","When I was searching for one of my favorite sonhs on YouTube for some reason there was no video for the song I wanted. I went to the app store and found Spotify. I then downloaded it and found the one favorite song I was looking for. 😊 I'm very pleased with this app and highly recommend it"
"November 27, 2015","I love this app! It let me listen to all the songs I want and love! I can create different playlist with all the different songs! This app also is a big help when I'm in a One Direction mood and want to listen to all my favorite 1D music! There's also a wide vatity of bands and all the music you can think of! I lovvve this app!"
"August 27, 2017","The only thing I don't like is commercials and this app don't have a lot but when they do its usually 2 at a time otherwise YEAS A ITS LIT"
"October 12, 2014","For free, you will not find a better music app. You can listen to an entire song or an entire album. I first found Spotify when visiting the Billboard website and wanted to hear the songs that were on the charts. I clicked on the Spotify link expecting a sample of the song and got the whole song. It's so good free, I will probably pay for it later."
"July 23, 2017","works good"
"September 19, 2017","Great item"
"September 5, 2017","Good Stuff"
"September 22, 2015","Okay so my opinion is that this is totally amazing if you really love it you should really upgrade to premium it is only $10 a month and you can listen ad free! And also without internet connection😂 at first I was like what is this gonna do?😕 then used for homework,getting ready,etc... but my facial reactions turned from😕 to😉 so this app is totally amazing😂"
"July 5, 2017","Love this app works great no isues"
"April 15, 2017","Love Spotify!!!!"
"September 20, 2017","Great app."
"September 25, 2017","I love it so I can listen to all of my favourite songs."
"August 24, 2017","Love my music"
"July 7, 2017","I can listen to any song, create playlists for offline use and even download them. I love Spotify!!"
"October 5, 2017","great app"
"June 11, 2017","I like that it's very easy to find the music I like and then, as it adds more songs, the whole selection is very coherent."
"March 24, 2017","This is the best program for music and works great with Alexa."
"August 9, 2016","I wish I had known about this sooner but I hear there may be a cost associated with using the free streaming service. I hope not because I JUST starting using it. Love it."
"October 10, 2014","The music selection is *outstanding* but the user interface leaves a lot to be desired. I think the screen is cluttered and distracting. I find it difficult to find & learn the tools available. That being said, there are quite a few tools that enable to listen to and enjoying the music you want. It's a great tool, just hard to use."
"November 1, 2016","Great love finding old music I hadn't heard in a long time plus finding current music."
"August 13, 2017","This app is great. You can listen to music and build playlists and other things."
"September 9, 2016","Fantastic app, works way better than the mobile version of it. With the Spotify app on Android, you are allowed to choose whichever music you want to listen to without having to pay the premium price. Love Spotify? Get the app."
"June 7, 2017","You can listen to songs from movies that haven't came in theaters!! This app is so awesome!!!!!! So I recommend it to people that love music or like to listen to music."
"September 2, 2015","Loved it so much that I subscribed to service and downloaded app to Kindle and mobile phone."
"June 15, 2017","This is the best app for listening music. I LOVE it!"
"February 17, 2015","Ok this is a good app but sense the update you need premium to pick any song you want. Where it use to be a free any song type thing but if you wanted the lessen off line you get premium. Also this is just my opinion but I just don't enjoy lessening to the radio that's just me. so if you like radio get this app and if like to pick and choose your music and don't mind spending a little money get this app. It is great and there lots of features just not all for free. Other than the premium problem I love this app."
"October 29, 2017","Loved it"
"May 16, 2017","Forget iHeartRadio and Pandora and other stations like that! You can find anything and everything you need on Spotify. But they do have ads and want you to pay for Premium. BUT I think you get 7 Days or a Month of Ad free Music but other than that... its pretty dope😂😂😂"
"March 5, 2016","Great, very fast. Have everything."
"June 16, 2017","This is the greatest app to use it is awesome I am 89 year's old and I am not intelligent! Thanks Spotify for opening my heart I feel like I'm 9 because of you"
"March 27, 2017","Comparable to Rdio, and burns Pandora."
"September 1, 2017","Love it!"
"October 25, 2017","as shown"
"October 1, 2017","Wonderful for my granddaughter."
"December 28, 2016","It's great besides the fact that you get numbered skips but you still have good quality music"
"June 17, 2017","Spotify is cool free but premium is like a music service on steroids. I love premium and an not dissatisfied with anything in this app. Keep up the good work guys."
"July 14, 2017","We like Spotify Music Plaform."
"January 28, 2017","BEST .....APP....EVER. I am so pleased with it, even without premium, I can play a lot of music. But not having adds every four songs would be nice, still five stars though. :)"
"July 23, 2017","It is really amazing it keeps your music and it lets you skip to the next song"
"August 20, 2015","Thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did.. I'm enjoying all the different genre's I can listen to, depending on my mood. Come give it a try, I think you'll be glad you did."
"March 15, 2017","This app has every song I need its awesome💖💖"
"June 18, 2017","I wish it were a little cheaper, but I love it."
"October 5, 2017","Great app"
"October 24, 2017","Great!"
"June 10, 2014","When I initially heard that Spotify would be free on mobile/tablets, I was thrilled. When I saw it wasn't the case on the Kindle, I was sad. When I noticed today that they'd uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.  Now, I'm just disappointed.  I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch. That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:  1. Without premium, one must be online to listen. Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?  2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle. Why is this a problem? Well, it's certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can't do that.  3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It doesn't have the best algorithm for this. Why is this a problem? If I'm listening to ""The Color Spectrum"" and it decides to throw a song from ""Migrant"" in the mix, that's really jarring. Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you (No, I don't like every album that band has put out.) or just lump everything into a few too-big categories (hip-hop, indie, rock, country) and throw the most random s*** from said category at you (And no, (new) Train is nothing like ""Of Great and Mortal Men"".). You only get a small number of skips if you don't have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet? Only it's not. Because that other app you're thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from ""Migrant"" at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.  Spotify on my computer? 5 stars. Spotify on my Kindle? I'll stick with Pandora."
"July 5, 2017","I never ordered this I have Spotify and have for 3 years why would I have 2 accounts I want my money back !"
"May 16, 2016","Wonderful. I am a premium member so I frequently use this app. Thankfully it is very cooperative with my Kindle Fire HD 8. I see no problem with this app at all. I would highly recommend this app, and I do quiet often, to family, friends and everyone who love listening to music."
"April 23, 2017","It crashes often"
"October 24, 2017","Works well including changing music with another device."
"September 4, 2017","love it. can find any type of music and when you play a certain type it will set you up with like type programs for each day. the 30 second commerical - every 30 minutes is not painful at all."
"July 13, 2017","U GUYS SHOULD HAVE THIS APP BC U CAN PICK UR FAVORITE artistes I LOVE IT I TAKE A SHOWER AND OUT MUSIC ITS SOOO GOOOOD"
"July 20, 2017","was really good"
"November 7, 2015","I have been using spotify free for a year now, I used to be able to skip as many times as I wanted to and play any song. I can't do that anymore since the most recent update. Spotify is supposed to be free on tablets and computers, meaning you can choose any song and skip as many times as you want but it still has ads. My moms tablet and my dads both have the ""tablet"" version of spotify. Not my kindle, I now have to use the sucky ""mobile"" version like is on my phone. Please recognize kindles as tablets and not phones. Spotify was great. Please fix this!! I don't understand why kindles are considered different than every other tablet."
"October 19, 2017","good"
"September 25, 2017","cool"
"October 28, 2017","Very good"
"April 9, 2017","You separate the catacorie of your music and there is very little comertrals!!!!! The best thing ever😀😎🙌🌈🌈🌈=-O 👑👑👍👍👍👍👍👍💖💖💗💗👌😏😎😱😁😁😁😁😁😉"
"October 12, 2017","Good vibes"
"September 6, 2017","Can't get enough of this app! Perfect for music on the go, and with a bit of personalization, it trumped Pandora in my book!"
"October 13, 2017","The thing that impressed me the most about this was the ease of use. I also liked O could put in the singer's name and hear only them. You don't have to listen to music that you dont know, you just listen to the music you asked for."
"February 8, 2017","i love i have access to alost all the music and podcasts my heart desires. i use spotify seven days a week for atleast three hours a day. it does eveeything i need on every device i own"
"June 16, 2017","This app is awesome😀😀"
"December 13, 2016","The app plays the music you want to play...but you have to pay for ad free music"
"September 22, 2015","I love Spotify, or at least the old version, now I am getting really frustrated. You have way too many adds, I get it that you want money ,but for the people who can't get premium it's really fricken annoying. Then the recommended songs that I don't want, along with the skip limit, that's just way too mutch. Other than that this app in wonderful, and lets me listen when I want."
"April 13, 2017","Item is what was described."
"April 19, 2017","It works really well"
"June 29, 2017","This app is one of the best music apps ivre ever had. Defiantly worth it for Premium"
"August 21, 2017","love it!"
"August 8, 2015","Whenever I heard about the amazing reviews I decided to download the app. I was impressed by how you could make your own playlists, however it went downhill fast. After playing around with it for a bit I decided to exit the app and do something else.... but couldn't find a way to exit the app! I ended up having to turn off my kindle fire to make it stop playing music. I think the creators had good intentions but there are a lot of bugs that need fixing."
"August 4, 2017","Great music app much better than the others. Let's you choose from listening to one artist or multiple. Also if you are a student you get a discount which is a plus for me."
"October 12, 2017","Its the best I can play music whenever I want and I can play it anytime with no problem only with WiFi but this app it amazing I really injoy it I hope this will be rated greatly in the future!!!!!👌😶😛😜😝"
"May 21, 2016","All the music it has is FREE! It runs smoothly and the ads happen after two songs, but who cares? Just turn it off! Great app!!! Totally recommend."
"August 20, 2017","Very rapid download,"
"December 3, 2015","This app works just like Pandora. I'm not saying it's copyright, as they do have a different feature, but still. That different feature? Paying. That is the only issue. They are currently giving 3 months for $0.99, but then it jumps to $9.99 per month! Honestly Spotify, you could lower that a little."
"August 2, 2017","Spotify has a great variety of music and allows you to make your own custom playlists. It also offers a discount to students!"
"May 25, 2017","Wonderful way to listen to music!"
"April 7, 2017","I enjoy my kind of music which is from the 20-60. Now I can listen whenever I want. Its great."
"April 14, 2016","Spotify is a great way to listen to your favorite music. I love to put my head phones on and just listen away. I recommend spotify. All the music is free. You can also listen to music while you play games! You can make playlists of all your favorite songs from country to rock or pop."
"November 10, 2015","I love spottily. There is no end to the playlists and albums you can download and you can have any music anytime, anywhere. Couldn't be happier."
"March 23, 2017","I love thus app!! It works so well"
"August 15, 2017","Spotify has been a lifesaver when I needed one. Three huge playlists and building!"
"August 11, 2017","Good"
"June 3, 2017","I like Spotify, and I love how you can make playlists. However, it would be great if it didn't require WiFi. I do still love it though😀!"
"August 4, 2017","Life is good. This helps."
"April 15, 2017","I love this app except for the 7 day premium trial when we sign up we should have premium automatically."
"May 20, 2017","I love how I can hear music for free! I love the quality and how it uses jot too much internet! Yes, get the app!!!!!!!"
"July 20, 2017","Excellent"
"May 25, 2017","Used Spotify for it's first few years in the States... LOVED IT!  Been away for a few, took advantage of the student discount subscription, I'm back and...  STILL LOVE IT!"
"October 24, 2017","Way way better than Pandora. Artist and song selection more varied and extensive. Should have gotten it a while ago."
"August 3, 2017","Love it"
"April 29, 2017","Love it!!"
"March 29, 2017","Works internationally. Great way to hear new music and console goodies. Great sound quality and options for play."
"March 1, 2016","This is cool and you can duplicate songs and it won't stop you!!!"
"January 19, 2017","I'm sure I haven't found all there is to learn but what I have so far is very fun. I like the idea that you say what categories you like and Spotify choses the song it will play. I don't get bored with them that way."
"June 19, 2017","Just love it!"
"December 4, 2016","Just perfect. Works incredibly fine with Echo Dot."
"April 2, 2017","The way u listen gets better the more you feed it"
"September 13, 2014","Doesn't work as well if you aren't a member of Facebook. Also, if you are non paid they play the music in shuffle mode which would be ok if the didn't keep playing the same music more than twice."
"April 23, 2017","Awesome!!!!!! Works perfect!"
"March 24, 2017","This is an amazing app, but every time advertisements play it either restarts or entirely crashes."
"August 9, 2017","I am very picky. I know what I want! Spotty let's me do as I wish; collect, switch, store and explore. When I work out I can create my pace needed at the time. Excellent!"
"August 21, 2017","What is there to say, free music. Just have to listen to some commercials.'"
"May 29, 2017","I love it!!! Because there are millions of choices of songs to choose from!!! 💗🎶🎵"
"September 8, 2016","This app is great. I love how you can match the music to your run cadence. I recommend this app and upgrading to premium because not having a commercial interrupt your music is worth the monthly fee."
"October 29, 2017","I like the variety they got going here. Few bugs every now and again but over all not bad."
"May 13, 2016","Spotify is a very very well made app to listen to music on. When you turn on Pandora you deal with advertisements and more. With Spotify advertisements are almost non-existent. The only thing that does need to be implemented is a setting to turn off or take out swear words. All in all this app is a very good app and I recommend this app to anyone who wants some music in their day."
"June 9, 2017","Totally nailed my exact taste while also introducing me to more awesome music. You can choose exactly what you wanna hear and you can condense the adds as you please"
"April 9, 2017","Great internet music."
"July 13, 2017","Love"
"October 24, 2017","Love this app, listen to this every day"
"June 15, 2017","Not a big deal"
"August 5, 2017","My fave"
"August 30, 2017","Need lock screen controls"
"April 6, 2017","Spotify is Awesome..."
"June 6, 2017","please update gui"
"July 29, 2017","Love this app use it daily"
"February 24, 2015","So this spotify crap, it works, it just stops every three songs or so. Just ephing stops, whether it be in the middle of the song, going to another song, doesn't matter. It just stops. When I go to press play it does nothing. How do you expect me to buy premium if it just stops? I rather just waste the 300 or so hours ot'll take for me to download all of my personal music on to my phone then deal with this crappy, crap."
"December 2, 2016","Been using spotify for a few years and it's simply the best. The Discover personalized playlists came around when I was considering getting rid of it and I'm hooked for a few more years I think."
"May 7, 2015","I recommend this app over all of its competitors.  It is a little hard to understand all the stuff in the app at first but whence you learn that it's a great music app.  You can pick the songs that you only want to listen to or you can have it pick songs for you. Way better then Pandora right.  Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!"
"May 12, 2017","Spotify is great. Highly recommended!"
"April 14, 2017","Honestly can say even premium with the offline feature is amazing. Not eating data while working is a life saver in low out of area signal coverage."
"June 16, 2017","I'm listening to spotify when I'm doing this review of how good the music is Get it get it"
"April 10, 2017","Best music app on the market for the price. The shared plan makes it even better. Its me,the wife, and 2 teenage boys on the family plan and any song I cld think of I have found."
"April 18, 2016","You won't know what you'll like until you hear it. Pick a genre, artist, anything having to do with music. Spotify will find it and play it for you. Choose an artist whose music you love, Spotify will create a radio program based on your choice! Endless possibilites!"
"June 27, 2017","Excelente!"
"December 30, 2016","My overall 3 stars rating is the average of 5 stars for the available music library and the user interface on my apple devices, desktop PC and android TV, and only 1 star for the interface on Roku, which looks and works like somebody created it in his garage more than a decade ago."
"May 6, 2017","I didn't know this existed until the other day and i wish like hell I'd know of it sooner. I love the different type and styles they offer."
"May 17, 2017","Great music app"
"February 24, 2015","I didn't care for the idea of spotify. BUT NOW I LOVE IT. Get premium and you'll never regret it. Perfect layout, very easy to use and perfect quality. If you have multiple devices you can control spotify from all of them. Makes the music experience so my much more interactive and integrated that you'll never want stop using this app. Download now!!"
"October 3, 2015","This is my music app! It's opened up my interest in so much new music and that's why I recommend it so much. Very nice display, by the way and very easy to navigate around the various musical genres. Of course, I would love it if they offered a bit more in the international, world music department. And I'm praying that Spotify expands the classical music selection as well. Still, this is one great app for the music lover!"
"January 25, 2017","I'm really loving this music"
"May 31, 2016","This app is my life! Freaking love it and hope all y'all out there get this so you can enjoy it too :p"
"June 5, 2017","Wide range of artists and easy to set up. The app asks which artists you like and creates playlists based on your answers. In my case the playlists are on target. I have the free version and the ads are low key and unobtrusive. I recommend it."
"January 15, 2016","I love it!! It has all music. YouTuber music, new music, new releases, different genres, no limit on how much music you get, get a 7 day free trial for Premium, create private playlist, collaborative playlists, and public ones. There's so much more stuff. Not as many ads as Pandora, definitely! I just love Spotify!!"
"October 26, 2017","I enjoy this app very much!!! I can get my praise on!!!!!!! I can get in the spirit and thank the Lord with only a 6 minute interval every 30 minutes. The gospel channel is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!"
"August 4, 2017","I like it, it has a lot of songs. Including Hebrew songs, which I like."
"April 14, 2017","I think Spotify is a amazing app because you can search for songs and if you tap on an artist is won't change the song unlike Panorama. I would give this app a 5 star rating!!!!"
"June 14, 2017","great"
"July 2, 2017","This is amazing"
"June 1, 2017","Love them"
"December 9, 2016","Love it! Though I wish you could filter out explicit songs for those times that I want to stream music at a 5yo birthday party."
"August 30, 2017","I Love how easy it is to create playlist, find new songs, learn something and share my music!!!"
"July 15, 2017","SPOTIFY IS MY FAVORITE!!!!!!!"
"May 18, 2017","Spotify is one of the services I would recommend to my family qnd friends. You can't go wrong with it."
"May 7, 2016","I can hear all the album music recorded by any artist."
"January 27, 2016","Great to listen to Music, but it is a pain to deal with is you are not subscribed. Also, if you do the three months for .99 that comes around every once in a while and do not want to fully subscribe, make sure to cancel the subscription the day before it is going to expire"
"August 28, 2014","I love Spotify it's the best music app you can listen to whole complete albums not just the same ones Pandora plays over and over this is the deal for free listen to all your songs or albums and they have a large catalog it's free but no downloads and got to have wifi to work and a commercial about every three songs but for $9.99 a month the same except you can listen off line and no commercials..I LOVE IT !!!!"
"October 26, 2017","I sit here listening to my past. I remember all the songs and all the people and experiences that go with them and they come to mind to ease my soul! Thank you"
"August 22, 2014","I really enjoy listening to music on Spotify. I like being able to listen to specific songs and add them to playlist. I have found great music I didn't know about by listening to others' playlists as well. The app is easy to use and the commercials are very reasonable in quantity and content."
"July 21, 2017","Great app, great quality music and everything 👌👌👍👍"
"October 4, 2016","Love using Spotify to listen to music that I don't already have in my personal collection"
"December 24, 2014","I've used Pandora and IHeart Radio, but neither of them are anywhere near as good as Spotify. On Spotify Free, you can listen to any don't song you want, and save it to a playlist. The only thing I would like to be able to do is download the songs without having to get Spotify Premium, but I completely understand why the download feature would be for Premium."
"April 7, 2017","Excellent"
"April 4, 2016","Am a premium subscriber (family plan). Well worth it. Have it on my cell phone and my Amaozon Echo."
"December 28, 2016","Day two of using this app and I find it to great for using the Bluetooth headphones and getting stuff done while enjoying my favorite music or laying on the couch with the flu..."
"July 27, 2017","Great"
"May 14, 2017","great music app..."
"March 26, 2016","This is an amazing app for music lovers especially if you get premium."
"April 6, 2017","use often"
"June 12, 2017","I enjoy Spotify music and even use it at home and at the gym."
"August 4, 2017","Has it all. Old and new Blues, Jazz, rock of all ages and now my songs are set up to be played when and where I want!!!! Thank you Spotify!!!!!"
"August 17, 2017","Use it all the time on my Kindle Fire. Love it!"
"December 9, 2014","Really enjoy this app/service. The premium service is a couple $ more than I think it is worth, However, the free version will drive you insane with the commercials. Can use your Smart Phone to control music/playlist selections on you Laptop, or other app and internet capable devices."
"May 3, 2017","it is okay"
"October 11, 2015","Something happened in the update that it only lets me play on shuffle and I can't pick just one song to listen to. And when I do not want to listen to a certain song on my playlist it only lets me skip a song 7 times and tries to get me to buy the full version of Spotify. So, I only listen to Spotify when I am in a really good mood. It doesn't make sense, HELP!"
"October 23, 2016","Ive had it for almost a year and its really good"
"March 2, 2017","spotify is the best"
"April 28, 2017","Is plays music"
"October 14, 2014","FINALLY, I'm done with pandora with it's stations that play only top forty hits (and other bogus selections.) This is what we waited for people. At first this app only let you listen to the radio unless you bought the premium version, but now you get an almost unlimited music selection for free without as many adds (only about 1 or 2 every 5-6 songs) There is still some stuff that needs worked out, like navigation and display, but it is well worth it!"
"November 26, 2015","OMG ...love love love this app..highly recommend"
"March 20, 2017","This is an amazing music streaming and downloading app! The fact that you can have a Premium 7 days FREE of ad free music and skippable music unlike I Heart Radio this is amazing!"
"March 16, 2017","Its great free music online but it would be great if on specific days or months there would be free to listen to if off line and no adds but besides that its great"
"May 13, 2017","Totally awesome. Except why'd they take away the ability to share songs within spotify accounts. My family and i really enjoyed communicating in that way. We do love all the Swedish, and Norwegian music though. ...KvelertaK RULES!"
"September 4, 2017","I think that Spotify is really cool because you list an to music at any time any where!!!😀"
"January 24, 2016","I love the app. It has a great variety of artists and music for all tastes. I tune in everyday to escape from regular radio stations so I can hear the music that I really enjoy. A bonus is that you can create your personalized playlists. And a discount for students. Great app overall. Highly recommended."
"March 16, 2015","Spotify is just the tits. I tried using the $20 credit Amazon gave me for their app store, but it wouldn't allow it. I'm using the free premium trial for now, and will probably pay for it when it runs out. Just as an FYI: to make music available offline you MUST have the space in your phone. Don't sign up for premium because of that perk without having the extra space."
"October 28, 2016","Love the ease of navigating thru any style of music. The only music app I use, period."
"June 14, 2017","Good"
"May 29, 2017","muy buena app"
"November 17, 2016","Works really well."
"July 29, 2017","I love it! It's great because I can listen to my favorite artists and I don't have to pay for it."
"August 17, 2015","I love spotify!!!! Just wish they had a bigger section of Korean and Japanese music."
"March 29, 2016","love the app. Don't get very good reception sometimes though so songs get often interrupted."
"March 2, 2017","Music intune app"
"March 7, 2017","This is definitely the best music app. I use Spotify Premium and it is amazing. I can listen to whatever song I want when I want. Strongly Recommend!"
"April 30, 2017","Work well."
"March 26, 2017","Great product!"
"April 25, 2017","Love it"
"June 27, 2017","I absolutely 💃 love it"
"January 9, 2017","I've been enjoying this app. What you can't find probably hasn't been created yet. On the downside of not purchasing the premium package is the fact that you can't hear the specific song you've been dying to listen to all day. Nevertheless, It's worth the time and space on your device."
"November 10, 2017","If you want to see what sounds like your music."
"December 20, 2015","I really love Spotify my choice for any music player. Better than Pandora actually! It's an all around great app. So it's a must get if your really into music. But the Only thing that grinds my gears is the ads like three ads that all last 30 seconds. So you listen to music for around 20 minutes and these ads play, but all you have to do is pay to get premium."
"March 9, 2017","Awesome app"
"July 8, 2016","I had been using this app for free for a year and finally paid for a subscription so I could listen to my playlists while camping. It worked great for several days, but on the day we went to come home the app logged itself out and required internet to log back in. It took an hour of our 6 hour trip to find WiFi, and then most of my songs were not showing as downloaded anymore. Very frustrating! It's been a month since then, and today all my songs are gone again! I won't be renewing my subscription."
"February 9, 2017","free music always interest me it is a bonus to be able to listen only to music that i like."
"March 6, 2016","Spotify is far superior to other music apps, it has the radio feature that lets you explore songs similar to those that you like as well as the playlist and album feature that lets you play specific songs. The kindle version does not require you to do shuffle play, but it is still available."
"April 30, 2017","Great streaming app! Better than Pandora. Free is also a great thing. Check it out... Needtobreathe, John Mark McMillan, it's all good."
"August 31, 2017","I have not used Spotify Music for many months, though the times I used the app I gained opportunities to listen to new genres of music, enjoyed all my selections of stations, and used the 30 day free trail that let me listen to Views."
"October 13, 2015","I love being able to listen to anything on Spotify including the latest hits... However I am disappointed with the fact that I can only cancel my paid subscription through email and am still continuing to be charged 3 months later... There's got to be an easier way to cancel, this isn't right.."
"April 6, 2017","I've only used this briefly, but I'm sure I'm going to love hearing my favorite music."
"March 17, 2016","This is the best music player available. Allows for many genres."
"April 30, 2017","Love it."
"September 21, 2017","love it"
"April 8, 2017","I love Spotify, but I was looking for a country artist named Garth Brooks, and was disappointed at what showed up: all covers of Garth's songs. I also enjoy some indie artists such as JayteKz. He wasn't on there and neither was Gwar. Somewhat disappointed, but otherwise a great music app."
"August 15, 2017","I love finding all my faves. The quality on a lot of the songs is not very good."
"April 6, 2017","Disabled"
"March 28, 2017","Best thing ever"
"February 24, 2015","Very good app. Allows u 2 listen music that u want 2 whenever u want. U do need WiFi. Allows u 2 make playlists and save albums and songs. Ah can also follow artists. Although 1 time I made a playlist and after the first song it would play songs from an album I had not saved. But a very good app. I recommend this 4 anyone who loves music."
"August 16, 2017","I love the songs and artists who make them"
"July 30, 2017","Great music, based on your preference!!!🎆"
"July 14, 2016","I like Spotify A LOT. The music selection is endless, the price is right, and I can have music anywhere! I only wish that it was a little more user-friendly. I finding that building playlists, folders, etc. to be a bit cumbersome."
"June 14, 2017","Best music streaming app!!"
"March 15, 2016","I (my mom) used to use Pandora but it only played random songs but Spotify only plays the songs that you download(for free) . There's no need for a email,password,or username. All you have do is to make sure you login every 30 days to refresh the lisence automatically."
"March 4, 2017","Very cool sounds"
"March 10, 2017","By Anna Kathleen /September 19 1979."
"April 9, 2017","Love it"
"August 17, 2017","Plays the artists till you change to another very well."
"August 2, 2015","I thought Spotify would be complicated, but it is actually easy. It doesn't cost money yet it has nearly every album ever made! I can listen to music while on the internet- on Youtube, you can't go onto another tab or the music will stop. I highly recommend this app for all ages! 😀"
"November 14, 2016","I am totally digging Spotify. I'm listening to music I haven't heard in years. And watching less tv. That said, I'm surprised how little is available for some artists. Still well worth the cost."
"April 1, 2017","Long time spotify user. Love the app"
"December 23, 2015","I love spotify so much. It works much like pandora in which you can create a radio station of an artist to discover new music. However, you can also find a certain song and save it into 'your music' and play it anytime you want where there's WiFi, for free. Overall, it's a great app and definitely worth the download."
"April 4, 2017","I mainly downloaded this app to listen to music from the Beatles, the rolling stones, etc. Very good due to the fact that it has the remastered editions, 5/5."
"April 2, 2016","You have to pay money to actually pick songs to listen too. Otherwise you have to shuffle your playlist and risk having to listen too a random song they recommend. I'm leaving this app alone till I get money. And you should too."
"October 3, 2015","I like this app I don't have premium, but I do still like it. If you just want to listen to music for free it's great. They have a great selection of songs. The ads aren't bad and they aren't that long, so I don't pay for the premium, but I have heard that people say the premium is worth it. All in all its a great app."
"July 10, 2015","Awesome!!! I just love, the music choices, and the choices, I can make!!!!"
"June 16, 2015","This is a great way to not only stay up-to-date with your favourite music stars/groups/composers, but the Spotify playlists are a vrery useful way to discover new ones. The interface is ""busy"", but once you get used to where everything can be found, it's very controllable and quick. A great experience."
"February 3, 2016","my kid bought this"
"January 9, 2016","Spotify has replaced itunes and all other music organizing and streaming programs for me. I have premium, being able to make changes on one device that apply to all is great and being able to download different playlists on different devices means that I can tailor my offline music to my needs."
"February 1, 2015","My favorite music app EVER! I love the playlists for every mood and I love making my own. I really love older music and they have a vast selection!!! Works great no hiccups!"
"July 29, 2017","Best music app ever! Great playlists and albums. Spotify rocks!"
"June 21, 2016","Almost ANY artist, song, or album that you could think of from musical history, and thousands more that you couldn't; all organizable in playlists, related-random play, or individually manually.  Excellent service & app. :)"
"July 20, 2015","The only thing is that it sometimes shows inappropriate images for album covers but and that you can not have one account open on 2 different devices butother then that best music app ever! I would rate it 10+ for inappropriate images. You can even create your own play lists and share them. I LOVE SPOTIFY:):p!!!"
"March 20, 2017","Great"
"February 18, 2016","Thanks"
"July 26, 2017","It create mix taps by itself so I would recommend it to people"
"July 5, 2015","It seems to take a lot of my RAM but other than that I really enjoy it."
"April 5, 2017","😉"
"September 19, 2016","Huge selection of songs and amazing playlists. Works smoothly and can be used as a remote if you're listening on PC. If you don't have the ad free Kindle, you won't be able to access the lock screen controls"
"February 26, 2015","All, I'll say is this is app is amazing beyond belief, I'm in shock that it exists...and for free. And in addition to practically any song, full album, or artist you can think of...new releases drop the same day as any paid store.  Without saying too much, using it on a tablet is EVEN BETTER due to some really nice perks that you usually have to pay for."
"September 21, 2017","Its great.remember to download your favorite songs ,so u don't forget.☺😎👍👍🎵🎶🎼"
"November 11, 2017","Its great!!! I love it!!! Has almost every song out there!!! 😚😚😚😁😁😁😁"
"March 24, 2017","Ok"
"December 17, 2014","It has tons of music for you. All you have to do is find the music you like and save it to your profile. It's FREE!!!!ðððð"
"May 27, 2016","I was looking for stressed out and it was an a blurry face radio and I was like aww I have to listen to all the song before I can listen to stressed out then BAM I found out how!"
"June 20, 2017","Spotify is awesome!"
"August 23, 2017","LOVE"
"January 26, 2017","I don't know how they do it but this app is so intelligent it knows what I want to hear before I do. I would have given it 6 stars if I could have."
"March 6, 2017","LOVE IT"
"August 24, 2016","I enjoy Spotify very much. I love the fact that with premium I can listen to music anywhere I go and it doesn't use my data that much! I love listening to music and I will continue to use Spotify when I do!"
"December 9, 2016","Very good music App although the tablet version is much better since phone version is a random play-fest."
"September 23, 2015","Can't find anything wrong with this app it's awesome. 10x better than Pandora or any of the other music apps I used. Has a great variety of music so u shouldn't have a prob finding something to groove to. And I love that it has viral hits on here as well. OVERALL A DOPE MUSIC APP suggest u check it out"
"April 27, 2016","I've had many music apps pandora, musify, music downloader, iTunes:( but spotify is by far the best one ever lots of stations, artists, every song I've ever looked up! Plus you get to create your own playlists!!!"
"August 19, 2017","Best music app. Allows you to listen to your favorite artists and songs."
"March 2, 2016","I have the free versio. When I listen to my playlist, it will only play 10 of the 30 songs."
"December 19, 2015","Spotify has been my favorite music streaming app and one of my favorite apps in general. I can listen to all the music I want and make my own playlists, or list to playlists that were already made up. The sound is great and it's really easy to use. I'll continue to use Spotify because it's a great app."
"August 12, 2017","Since my church is one that creates music libraries, I can listen to all the songs that they put on there. I love it!!!!!"
"September 11, 2015","Spotify is nice for how it has all my favorite music and how its easy to find new ones that are in the same subject of the bands your listening to. It is nice to have in school, for parts, or at work. I love to listen to music and this app let's me do just that. I say this is my favorite app I have and its the best"
"February 17, 2017","Great"
"August 30, 2017","I love this app but every time a video ad comes on my tablet spazzes and refuses to play anything until I clear everything out and go back into the app. Idk if it's a glitch or what. Anyone else having this problem?"
"June 8, 2016","My favorite music app. Have everything downloaded offline so i can use away from the internet."
"July 23, 2015","I love this music service. I love being able to play the song of my choice and search for the songs of my choice and to also listen commercial free as long as I want to and to create playlists and subscribe to others play lists."
"March 12, 2017","I love the app and content, but for some reason the music keeps pausing on its own. And then iis especially annoying when I am working on an assignment and have to keep switching back to the app to turn the music back on. (Amazon Fire Tablet)"
"June 15, 2017","I love all the different playlists and discovering new music..."
"June 14, 2017","I have an spotify premium account on my galaxy when I to download the app on my Fire HD 8 it asks me to check my billing address and payment are from a supported country (I live in Spain). What should I (or spotify or amazon) do?"
"July 19, 2017","Spotlight has been working great for me I have had it for months and never been discouraged!! I recommend this app to y'all out there!Also getting spotlight premium is totally worth it it only costs a little and does so much!!!!😊"
"December 28, 2014","Very thorough collection of music. Having access to anything and everything without the guilt associated with stealing artists' intellectual property is always nice. I think the trade off of $9.99 a month for peace of mind and access to a large selection of music is a great thing."
"January 21, 2017","Omg this is one of my favorite apps ever I listen to my music on here very day, this is the best music app that I have ever gotten I have had this for about two months already and it is awesome you should definitely get this app you won't regret it.💗💖💗💖💗💖💗💖💗💖💗💖💗💖💗💖💗💖💋💋💋"
"October 22, 2017","I use my Spotify almost every day at work"
"July 6, 2017","sure I received a working product. Great product and very easy to work with. thank you so much for getting it to me With The Quickness These are great Work amazingly well the next will continue to buy Pretty good."
"January 1, 2017","Spotify is absolutely amazing. It's so easy to use! Just pick an artist or song and it plays what you want it to. Adds every once in awhile, but other than that, it's the best music playing app EVER!!! (You even get to skip as much as you want!)"
"July 4, 2015","I would recommend this app for everyone. Although u have to meet a certain age in order to listen to music it's good. But it keeps telling me to get premium or something. Put Spotify is great app. I would recommend this app to everyone. If u love music u should totally get this app. You get to listen to every single song u heard. Y name it it's there. THANKS SPOTIFY!!!😆😆"
"September 4, 2017","Good selection. Random play tends to be repetitive."
"August 22, 2017","I can . Listen to it all day and do homework without getting distracted I love it"
"August 15, 2017","I use Spotify when I run,football practice,sleep etc."
"August 4, 2017","I really enjoy that they have such a great selection."
"October 24, 2014","OMG I love this app. Once I downloaded it I spent the night browsing and saving songs and whole albums. Highly recommend!"
"September 6, 2017","I'm so pleased with this music app. If you truly love great, hard to find tracks, especially live recordings, Spotify is the best."
"August 6, 2017","I like it 😊"
"August 23, 2017","It's a little difficult and clumsy as far as setting up your own grouping of music for albums or radio station building .."
"March 16, 2017","Love Spotify!"
"April 10, 2017","Great music app only if you have premium"
"August 26, 2017","Best musicapp you can buy and you don't need your password for your e-mail!"
"July 14, 2017","App is very user friendly."
"August 23, 2017","Really like the music like this as i do alot of hobbies and i dont have to get up and change my music. Thank you very much for this."
"July 5, 2016","I believe I enjoy Spotify better than the other free music app offered for Kindle Fire. The commercials are very brief and only every half-hour. The ""navigation"" also seems to be less cumbersome than Brand P."
"September 12, 2014","I tried to stump it with some of my more obscure world music artist and Spotify had it covered. Very good. Took me a long time to finally give it a shot. I'm pleased so far."
"May 26, 2015","When I got Spotify I thought, &#34;I sure hope this doesn't suck.&#34; And let email just say, this app has reach my expectations and way over. I'm listening on the app as I write! I can search my favorite songs, my favorite artists and bands, also the albums I love! This is a terrific app and it should be shared."
"October 17, 2016","apps like an app should app"
"September 28, 2016","Blackberry 10 OS #1."
"February 18, 2016","Love this app this is way better than Pandora I like how you can listen to whole album and make a play list of my own to listen to this is soooooooooooo cool but I wish the price each month was a little bit cheaper. And the commercials was shorter so thank you the services Spotify"
"August 1, 2014","Amazing. Simple. Modern and stylish. Great quality. Exhaustive library of songs. Fun to use.  There's many easy ways you can listen to music. Whether you'd like to simply create a unique playlist of your own, listen to entire albums, create a radio station, or tap on browse to listen to playlist already provided to fit whatever mode your in, all are simple, fun ways to listen to the music that you love."
"March 14, 2017","It's lit, super lit"
"September 18, 2017","Great music application, perfect for me."
"April 21, 2017","It let's your feeling better love it"
"December 21, 2016","Spotify is the best. I upgraded to the family premium account and we all love it. I especially like that every week they custom make a playlist just for me."
"July 7, 2017","Great app. Not every song under the sun is available, but that's not their fault so still 5 star app. Get premium though for songs on the go without data."
"April 9, 2017","Premium membership is well worth it for the ""For daily mix"" and ""Weekly Discover"" playlists akonr. Makes a great gift for a kid you could add to your family plan as well."
"January 31, 2017","I like that you can create your own music list unlike Pandora."
"October 21, 2016","I love Spotify because when I'm on a motorcycle ride with no service I can listen to downloaded playlists. Its worth the monthly fee if you ask me even though I wish it were a little cheaper."
"December 25, 2014","I can't live without Spotify, seriously I feel like my days are missing a little something if I don't listen to some music, even if for short spams of time. With this app, I have my music with me while I read; just add a cup of coffee and I can say I'm in heaven.  The app runs smoothly on my Kindle Fire6, no issues whatsoever. It synchronizes perfectly and sound quality is great (taking into account the Kindle speaker's limitations). If you've used Spotify on your PC/Mac, or Android devices; you'll see no difference in here."
"August 16, 2015","Pretty good app, functions well, good selection, and free"
"August 22, 2017","I can have all my favorite songs on here and not have to worry about other songs playing! I would reccomend this music app. Its the best one ive found so far!!"
"April 28, 2016","Amazing. Simply amazing library.all for free. Let me describe what spirit is. On mobile, it is radio, with your favorite music. But. Significantly less ads and none of the stupid radio shows that most of the time include inside jokes and ads.  If you just want music at any time you wish and any music you want you got it here."
"April 27, 2017","good app"
"September 4, 2017","Spotify is the only music app I'll ever use."
"October 22, 2015","My daughter loves this app."
"December 12, 2015","Can't really function w/o it. Probably the best music app that has come around since the fall of the great original Zune subscription app."
"October 6, 2014","I love the selection of music that is offered here and am very pleased with this app. I would recommend this to anyone"
"August 14, 2015","I really like this app. I pay $10 per month and can download all my favorite music without having to rely on wifi!"
"January 19, 2016","This app is really good. I gave 5 stars because you could use it while playing most games and with premium you could have unlimited skips and won't have to put on shuffle every time you want to listen to music. Add as helpful if you know this joke ......SPOOFY"
"July 26, 2016","Just get it, and get Premium, you won't regret it!! You can make as many playlists as you want, follow many great artists, listen to your favorite artists music, mix things up, see what your friends are listening to, and many other things imaginable."
"January 3, 2015","Of course, this is just my opinion. I've tried lots of different ones in my time. I just can't beat this one, for free, or better yet, totally worth the monthly subscription fee to bypass ads and gain full feature access on mobile. I've only been using the kindle app for spotify for a little over a week now; but no major bugs or glitches yet. I love it."
"July 9, 2017","Anything u want to hear is fantastic love it bb"
"September 10, 2015","The overwhelming amount of music you can stream for free is astounding!! All you need is a internet connection you can also list in to music without internet but be warned if you don't have some sort of paying card then your just gonna have to stick with your first option  All in all great music"
"February 28, 2015","This app is hands down the best app there is and more than perfect for those who love music and are listening to it often or even people who just want a little backround music for a party. Extremely great and you can any song for no price and once every half an hour you might have one ad very great app. I definitely recommend!! If you have any doughts dont because you will not be dissapointed at all."
"May 31, 2017","Cost More than Amazon"
"July 24, 2017","Fairly poor range of selections for classical music. And why default to random movements instead of grouping the whole piece together. Will try jazz next, but not hopeful."
"August 2, 2016","I'm listening all day long. Love it!!"
"August 7, 2014","I have a kindle ipad desktop and a mobile I was a little hesitant at first was not sure if I could listen to my selection of music offline and I can goodbye Pandora HELLO specify!!!"
"April 2, 2017","I love this app! Whenever I'm bored, I just listen to music. Spotify has every song I like! Really, really recommend it for people with Pandora."
"September 21, 2016","Spotify is a great music app. You simple just search for any track, artist, or album and start listening for free. I love this free app, I use it all the time. You can create a great music collection."
"September 7, 2017","I am not good with computers. I thought finding the music was difficult and not really sure how to use it."
"August 1, 2016","This is app is amazing you can listen to all tiles of music even new albulms. I don't have spodify premium but the adds are not that bad. This app is definetly !y recommendation.💙"
"August 22, 2017","I love making my own radio stations but want to know how to add new stuff in so it's not so repetitive. But I love it it's just work sometimes to get what you want"
"June 20, 2017","Pretty solid app!"
"February 3, 2017","Love me some music"
"March 21, 2015","Spotify is an awesome music app which allows you to do stuff pandora doesn't usually allow you to do. You can make your own playlist and if your using a kindle or a computer you can play any music you want as much as you want. Though the only downside is you can't download it for offline if your not a premium member you can get the best quality if your a premium."
"January 28, 2017","ok"
"November 2, 2017","All performance wise it's perfect. But it would be great if it has Alexa support."
"November 21, 2015","Spotify is wonderful but there's a huge problem. When enabling music to play offline it causes all downloaded music to be stored in your internal storage bank which fills up extremely quickly. The lack of option to move the storage to an SD cards means very minimal download space. I love Spotify but this is just a terrible side of this app. Hopefully they fix it soon."
"May 23, 2017","This app is wonderful. I really love it. Though I don't have premium or any other upgrades, I can say with certainty that even with out those, it's still amazing. I totally recommend it to anyone who likes music."
"June 8, 2017","I'm still learning how to use it but so far I am really enjoying the music"
"May 23, 2017","My music world has expanded."
"October 23, 2015","So far this has been the best way for me to listen to music. I like that the have the offline mode for premium members, it definitely saves my data when I'm on the go. The only downside that I've found is the lack of songs available for certain artist but that is to be expected."
"April 3, 2016","I've only tried the free version but even with this, you can't go wrong. You'll be listening for a while before you hear any commercials, and then they only last seconds. They are certainly more tolerable than radio commercials. And, I've found just about any type of music that I searched for."
"September 19, 2017","I think this is a great app because I can chill with my friends and listen to all kinds of music. I like queen, beatles, citizen king, and more!"
"January 6, 2015","It would be beneficial if the phone had done way to see the music that is local to the device so that it could be used in 3rd party alarm apps. It would also be nice if there was a way to auto play a playlist or resume the playlist/radio on asp open."
"July 29, 2017","Spotify has all of the old school music and the new school music."
"June 24, 2017","Great platform for curating a play list and discovering new artists!"
"July 24, 2017","This app is the same as Pandora. I think you can listen free without WiFi, but you need a premium account to do that .& I'm pretty sure that costs MONEY. SO I STILL LIKE IT But u won't get to enjoy it for free. That is the.ONLY reason I downloaded this app because I thought I could listen for the $free.99 (without WiFi). it is a little tricky at first. It slow too."
"May 1, 2015","This app is awesome because I just feel better when I hear music so I love this app"
"October 25, 2017","Great music app all the new music quickly"
"June 26, 2015","I love this app. This is just my opinion. The app play the music really well ..you can navigate easily through the music selection and the artist and you can create your own playlists very easily. I would recommend anyone who loves listening to all types of music and want it just a click away this is for you."
"February 9, 2016","I had Pandora and the iHeart radio app, but neither compare to Spotify. Unlimited skips, huge library of music, and great quality sound. But Spotify Premium is even better. Download songs and listen to them without WiFi/cell service. Only have had one problem; a glitch with the app mot letting me sign in, but was fixed. Besides that, best music app there is."
"May 15, 2015","I love being able to stream albums and individual songs vs. just building a radio station around an artist, album, or song."
"March 26, 2017","I like this app but I keep making a Play list but it transfers to the radio and gives me songs that I don't like in all it is good but if the fix this problem it would be 100times better."
"March 22, 2015","Love it. Easy to use and I don't have to host the music on my devise!!"
"September 22, 2016","Lots of fun and relaxing."
"September 10, 2015","I really love Spotify. Great playlists, great variety, reasonable ad interruptions for the free version. I use this over Pandora, Amazon music and several others. My one complaint: occasionally the music won't play on my Kindle fire. I can not figure out an explanation. There seems to be no rhyme or reason that I can identify or that is consistent."
"August 4, 2014","This is the very best radio on the web. You can pick an artist and it will play only music from that artist!! Therefor, you truly listen to what you want...COOL..... There was only one thing I don't like, commercials but they are short and spaced nice. So, this app gets a 5 star...... to the app writers and all involved in this app........keep up the good work!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!"
"November 12, 2016","Works great!"
"August 11, 2016","I love it but i live out in the country and i cant use it because i dont have internet. It sucks that you have to have wifi to use this amazing app"
"October 3, 2017","Every time i try to create an account, they are experiencing technical difficulties..."
"September 16, 2016","I really enjoy this app, always reliable when listening to music."
"October 13, 2016","it works"
"March 17, 2015","Randomly stops working. Will tell me there is no internet connection when there absolutely is one. Often will say 'Track not available' for no reason, even though it is on a playlist or actually stored on the device, and I do have an internet connection anyway. Often songs will say it is playing but there is no sound. Some songs just won't play, ever, no matter what. Sometimes songs are missing from an album. Huh? The 50% of the time Spotify works the way it should I like it, but the other 50% of the time is beyond frustrating. I blame the Kindle's terrible proprietary software for the problem as much as the app itself, though. Return your Kindle asap, buy a real tablet, download the regular Android version of Spotify that will actually work."
"April 8, 2017","Spodify is a really awesome app. It lets you pick from tons of music stations, and you can also make your own. And if you listen to it on your computer you can pick any song you want to listen to. I really recommend it to anyone who loves music!"
"June 4, 2017","I LOVE IT!!! So many great songs, many great playlists, and.... ITS ALL FREE. If you get premium thers more great stuff!! GET IT NOW!!"
"October 27, 2014","The app will not work on my Samsung Galaxy 5 phone. Spotify has tried to help me, but this is a known issue on this phone. They want me to pull my SIM card, but that requires me opening my Otter Box etc. and it is just not worth the trouble. I do use them on the computer, and it works great. Really SAD that I cannot use this app on my phone."
"November 9, 2017","Cant go wrong when it comes to music apps. I just wish it were less expensive. $9.99 a month is overpriced."
"October 26, 2017","I am a new subscriber. Love it so far."
"August 11, 2017","The app helps me in times of sadness it is really reliabil"
"March 1, 2017","I love spotify. However; it is often interrupted on my ""Amazon Fire Stick"". Not so much on laptop, nor tablet."
"December 4, 2016","Ok"
"April 16, 2016","I love Spotify but there are ads every 30 minutes but other than that I love Spotify! 💗"
"August 14, 2016","I've had this app forever and its still music heaven"
"March 12, 2017","It doesn't let me upgrade to spotify premium on my kindle fire for offline music but it let's me upgrade it on my phone please fix it"
"December 13, 2014","Been using Spotify for a few months now and I love it! I have been able to find every song I've ever looked for. It has playlists available to fit every mood, genre, and day of the week and I have discovered some amazing songs and artists on those playlists. I had a free trial of premium and I liked it so much I am going to cancel my satelite radio service and keep the Spotify premium!"
"May 18, 2015","I downloaded it and it started crashing my apps and it opens apps up by themselves. I click the home button to get out of the spotify app because it want load it opens up my games I keep clicking home opens app after app then crashes them."
"January 3, 2016","Title says it all. Pandora maybe great, but it has nothing on Spotify. The ability to pick and choose your songs is in of itself amazing, but add on the fact they have these custom made playlists with almost all types of genres from Today's Pop to 60s and from Rap to Concentrated Scratch. This app truly is a music lovers choice."
"October 4, 2017","How come when I use the app on my tablet (Kindle Fire) I can play any song I want, but when I use my phone, the songs have to be shuffled? It's great on the tablet, but on the phone I may as well use Pandora, which has an eadier-to-use interface. Make the phone work like the tablet, and you'll get 5 stars."
"July 27, 2017","love it."
"July 11, 2017","I love this! I can listen to music all the time with this!"
"October 16, 2017","Great app. Great Music."
"August 4, 2017","I can listen to single songs,entire albums or podcasts. Couldn't ask for anything better."
"November 11, 2015","Love this app, I have the Kindle Fire HD 6 and haven't had any problems with it."
"July 16, 2014","Absolutely the best music app out. It is definitely worth the monthly charge. Fast response to the user for skipping and the search engine works well. It read my mind for a artist I hadn't heard in years and then was trying figured out who he was lol. Awesome app recommended."
"May 30, 2017","Great!"
"September 30, 2015","Love Spotify!"
"August 12, 2017","Love this app! I don't mind paying for it because my whole family uses it. I have collected quite a few playlists. Has all the new stuff as well as oldies. We use it quite often. I recommend this app."
"August 22, 2017","excellent"
"January 18, 2016","It is the best music app ever with very little adds interrupting my music the music that also happens to be the music I chose it lets u download full albums no cost it is something I use on the daily I highly recommend it for any one who listens to music ever."
"November 5, 2016","I'm very impressed with spotify, you can pick different types of music that you want to listen to. This is way better than Pandora. You can listen to spotify when you play other games. I recommend this app to everyone."
"August 12, 2017","I love Spotify!When I want to listen to music,I just go to my room and turn on music!I only listen to a few songs but I like the ones I listen to very much.I would gives you a hundred stars if I could!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"March 29, 2017","I so enjoy Spotify!!! Its great to listen to all my favorite music. Pleased!!"
"September 24, 2016","Love it"
"October 15, 2017","I love variety of music I have to choose from and how easy it is to navigate!"
"September 23, 2015","I downloaded app and must of start some trial offer and I can't get a hold of them my phone always busy. In the meantime I keep getting $9.99 for the last four months and I've nothing to show for it.. I don't listen to the station. I tried it couple of times and wasn't impress. I use Pandora. So I would be real careful about using this no support app. I have brought a radio station that isn't user friendly mostly heavy rock offer. That's all I know and they do withdraw funds whenever they feel like. What does a music app have that Special for ten dollars, nothing! BEWARE$$$$$"
"July 18, 2017","Super easy yo use and great selection. Large diverse catalog"
"December 3, 2015","Good.......but if you're like many kids.....you don't pay for music....."
"August 3, 2017","If you like music and want to destroy the replay button this app is for you☺"
"June 4, 2017","Just a crash happy bunch of hit songs. Totally just wiped the phone too. Worked for a bit I suppose having to give it one star to rate it badly is fair."
"June 26, 2017","I was pleased to hear some oldies but goodies on the blues assortment. Looking forward to the jazz sets."
"August 20, 2017","It didn't even work on my Kindle Fire HD 7, installation failed multiple times..."
"October 17, 2015","Great app to have. Great selection of music and you cab personalize to have just songs that you enjoy"
"September 4, 2017","App works like it should and the music is good"
"April 23, 2016","This app is aamazing! It has pretty much every thing from guns n roses to dropkick Murphys (both of which I recommend). My only complaint is there are these things called premium features and it says upgrade to Spotify premium to use and you can't. But other wise great app 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😃"
"May 22, 2017","Spotify has everything!"
"July 29, 2017","Simply the best in music streaming."
"November 1, 2016","Twas pretty chill"
"March 31, 2016","I love this app! It's runs great, and has all the song I'm looking for. The only severe flaw to this app would be that it needs WiFi for everything! You can't listen to any of the music if you don't have WiFi. Besides that great app!!"
"December 14, 2014","Love that I can also follow my friends music and all my favorite artists. Will share this with my friends and family . They will love it."
"July 11, 2017","Spotify has great music and it's easy to find a Song I would recommend this App to people who love to listen to Music and need a good app"
"June 26, 2017","My first time with a music program. Love the Message to Bears sound on my Fire."
"November 30, 2014","I have tried lots of other music apps and none of them are as good as this one. It does what Pandora does plus you can look up other songs without limited skips. It is wonderful."
"October 2, 2015","The adds are annoying and you can not hand select songs😕😕😕"
"May 6, 2017","Wonderful. Excellent. Marvelous music music. Music..good. Selection. Good. Choice. Of. Artists. Of. Various. Genres. . hoorah. Yea. Yea. Yea yippee."
"September 28, 2016","I started using this program on a PC, and didn't care for the reduced options on the app. Either let me do everything (access my private favorites list and change the song) as a computer does, or don't make an app! I have youtube app, and found with all the restrictions, I prefered YouTube or Pandora. Deleted the app after three days of use."
"March 22, 2016","Love it! Great variety available. Wonderful options."
"February 24, 2015","For being older and not technology savvy, this app is easy to use. The range of genres is excellent. Thanks Spotify!"
"May 24, 2016","Amazing and great because its practically free but for some reason offline it doesn't work ,even though I downloaded the songs a dozen times. Please fix and I will rate 5 stars, no 100 stars! Its an awesome music app! 🔧🔨 😄😀😁😂 😆😆😆😆"
"May 17, 2017","I just the variety of music"
"August 9, 2017","I only wish the playlists were more customizable like non-streaming music playing programs. Other than that, it's a fantastic app and I even recommend paying for premium."
"October 29, 2017","Great selection, easy to get to it and huge podcast selección."
"December 18, 2015","i don;t mind ads but I hat that you can't skip songs unlimited"
"October 16, 2017","Very Good! It plays all your favorite songs!"
"November 5, 2017","I like this app very much. Just wish you could listen to music with out internet or premium. That would get more downloads and you could do the no adds for prem"
"January 6, 2015","The limitations levied on mobile devices intended to manipulate premium purchase are excessive- almost rendering it unusable. But if you're using pc or tablet, spotify basic is great. A competitor is needed to save them from self inflicted alienation of their own consumers, adds and offline mode are incentive enough for premium."
"July 3, 2016","A lot of people use Pandora, but I prefer Spotify for its hands-on song choice. it really gives a lot of options for making playlists, from radios which are updated and random to choosing song by song. To whoever created Spotify: thanks and awesome job!"
"June 18, 2017","Outstanding app to listen, reflect and enjoy our favorite music. Would be great if I could skip from song-to song with out listening to that particular song on my mobile device just like I can on my computer."
"September 30, 2015","Well designed app for one of the best music streaming services"
"February 5, 2015","I love this music app! Out of all the ones I have downloaded, and I have many, this one is used most often and is my favourite.  As long as the company and artist have it licensed out for spotify to play it, it's here.  You'll love this if you're a music lover!"
"February 27, 2015","Stream it all day at work. I love that I can choose a whole album or choose from some of the great playlists that have setup."
"October 22, 2017","Great app! I have it on my phone, tablet, and computer and love how I can pick up from wherever I was!!"
"December 10, 2016","Works great from my iPhone to iPhone speaker. I love the endless music to choose from."
"April 3, 2017","Nothing comes close to the variety of artists and albums. I've found albums that I lost years ago and new artists thati discovered from my kids. Great app!"
"February 3, 2017","I don't know what I would do without Spotify. I have it on my computer and two different mobile devices and they all work together flawlessly. The little bit extra for premium is the most worth while subscription I've ever had."
"December 30, 2016","The worst add in premen fechers"
"March 3, 2017","Good app but cost a bit much for Premium. Would definitely recommend this app to music"
"July 31, 2017","Great music & updates"
"August 13, 2017","Best app ever!"
"December 7, 2015","There is multiple reasons it sucks, I've only had it for about 2 minutes before I noticed the &#34;shuffle only&#34; thing. WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA?! You click the track thinking your going to listen to it, but the &#34;shuffle&#34; option flashes at you as if saying &#34;you have to shuffle it to listen to music, retard!&#34;. I hope somebody got fired for this. The fact that they think I like one song, so I like every song is just plain stupid. Do the world a favor and release something GOOD, please. Thank you for exciting me for nothing. Eff you, and goodbye."
"July 9, 2017","Listen to often"
"May 3, 2016","I have complete control of what I wanna listen to unlike another app I know. *coughs and mumbles* Pandora."
"May 20, 2017","definitely my favourite music app"
"July 3, 2014","This is a must have app if you love music you have a variety of Playlist choices from pop to children's and subscription is only about $10 bucks not much."
"August 10, 2016","bla"
"July 6, 2016","I absolutely love listening to metal music but I wish that they would make premium free!!! Please!:("
"March 13, 2017","It is super awesome you get to pick the music and it's wonderful for playlists I love this app it's great for anyone!"
"January 22, 2017","I listen to spotify all the time and love the suggestions!!"
"July 18, 2017","It has all these songs for FREE!!!!!!"
"June 21, 2017","Great service, nice music selection"
"July 10, 2015","The newer versions are becoming more and more difficult functionally though. The button to add songs to your playlist keeps getting smaller and smaller. Make the buttons bigger please (using the kindle version of Spotify)!"
"August 18, 2015","Does not allow me to play music on my Kindle. Just keeps flashing a message saying to download premium for ad free music."
"May 2, 2017","But I have to keep trying this over. It stops working if it isn't on top, main thing running which I got mainly to listen to as I surf."
"September 1, 2017","Excellent music app, love it!"
"February 26, 2015","Love listening to my favorite music"
"May 12, 2017","Read The Title..."
"July 31, 2017","Its worth it trust me very helpful"
"February 20, 2016","Worth my money! I installed Spotify on all my devices so I have it everytime. Offline playlist capability is just an awesome feat. Hope more artists would be on Dpotify tho, but I really appreciate that a LOT of indie artists can be found here. My playlists just grew, and my music taste became more diverse! Thank you, Spotify!"
"May 17, 2017","The most amazing music app I've ever used, although i haven't gotten premium yet it is still is a great app to use to listen to your favorite music."
"August 19, 2017","Awesome! All the songs I was looking for and some oldies I almost forgot about. Great!"
"August 24, 2017","KPOP yeah. Glad I listen to K-POP."
"July 21, 2017","This app is great"

"August 1, 2017","You guys are awesome Aka epic"
"May 4, 2017","When I downloaded the app and tried to sign up for Spotify it kept on saying that there is an error. I've been trying to sign up for a week now, I'll just have to resort to something else. I'm sure Spotify is great but amazon should improve apps like these BC there are a lot!"
"June 7, 2017","Amazing!!!!!!! Truly!!!!!!!"
"October 24, 2015","Love the experience of approach music.I would really rate a ten"
"August 7, 2017","Works like amazon music but larger selection of songs"
"May 23, 2017","I love spotify! I hate I waited so long to get it. They have a huge selection. So far, I've found everything I wanted and more!"
"May 14, 2016","I like that they play only the songs I have in my playlist"
"May 15, 2017","I found Spotify about a week ago, and Love, love, love it. It's easy and oh, so full of beautiful stuff."
"August 21, 2014","As soon as there is room in my budget I'll get Spotify Premium, great service since they added the mobile capabilities. Very easy to listen to a specific artist, unlike other streaming services. Has helped prepare me for many a concert. And for road trips, the sci fi radio dramas are unbeatable!"
"September 10, 2015","I dont know if it was the update or not but now the only way you can listen to anything on spotify is by clicking shuffle, you cant pick anything anymore. I wished they wouldn't have screwed with anything!"
"June 9, 2016","Just about any music anytime you want...anywhere you are...and less ads than the radio..."
"May 22, 2016","Best music service ever."
"June 2, 2016","THIS APP HAS ALL THE MUSIC U WANT AND NEED."
"March 31, 2016","Don't waste your money on the Premium!!! Had it for almost a year... - could NEVER get ""My Songs"" to play correctly (using 2 different laptops and three different Android phones in that time). Some would play, wome would just not and whenever they would come up it would stop the entire shuffle....and then they would play the next time through.... - Making play lists and saving things for Offline use is a pain in the ass!! - The ""artists like this"" or ""songs like this"" function is no better than Pandora (and I've never paid for that premium service""  I went to Spotify because Itunes is a pain....but honestly it's no worse...plus had I stayed there, I would actually OWN all the songs I've found on Spotify in the last year!"
"March 17, 2016","Downloading this app was a great idea in my part. The app ( like pandora) had a variety of both music and radio stations. But this one allows the listeners to have a choice on what to pick. So if you wish to have a bit of music in your life than downlaod this app."
"August 30, 2017","Elaine's poetry brings my mind to the peace and healing of the land she shares,with nature.the freedom to see who you are The old look at your self was there. Before. Mem"
"March 29, 2016","This app works just like it does on other platforms. Correctly."
"February 12, 2017","Almost all of my favorite music in one place I can take anywhere. Also a powerful tool for discovering new favorites. Unfortunately they've dumbed down the social features and the app can be glitchy. Still deserves 5 stars."
"February 18, 2015","It is great that you can pick your songs and play them over and over (unlike pandora) but $10 a month is bordering expensive if you, like me, like to have 10 apps that have a monthly charge. It all adds up. Even though I like this app, because it is more than twice the price of Pandora Plus, I will likely cancel it in the future. Pandora is easier to use and works for about everything I need it for."
"July 19, 2017","It has lot of song 😘😘😘"
"March 10, 2016","Do you seriously have to pay $10 a month just to listen to music?! I mean for premium?! I mean, you could just pay once and not have to pay $10 a month, but that is just impossible!!!!!"
"September 12, 2015","I've had a great time making my playlist, love that I can play it offline."
"June 20, 2017","excellent library and service"
"April 19, 2017","This is the best thing ever my mom has it two and she says it the best"
"April 1, 2017","Has a lot of songs I like. I enjoy it and so do my kids. Many different genres available. Only gave it 4 stars bcuz there are still some songs\artists not available on this app."
"May 21, 2017","Its reputation speaks for itself. Easy to use and customize. Organized in such a way so that you can spend less time researching new music and more time enjoying it. Five stars. Great investment."
"September 10, 2015","This app was Good and you could make your own playlist and fast forward when you like. But now with the new update everything is pretty much the same except now your not able to fast forward and for certain songs all there is are covers. Which stinks because if you were able to fast forward unlimitedly I would rate this a 5 and more."
"September 12, 2014","I love making playlist on my PC and listening to them on my iPhone. I have lists for running, camping, driving, chilling, pretty much anything. Sure there are ads in the free version, but you have to decide for yourself if it is worth ponying up money to skip commercials and listen to music on demand. It is still way fewer breaks than FM radio and I don't mind my playlists shuffled."
"November 6, 2015","This is an awesome app!!! When I found out that I couldn't get music on my kindle without paying for it I was bummed but then my friend told me about spotify so I decided to try it,I am so glad I did! You have to put in some personal information, but from then on it is totally free. THANK YOU SPOTIFY!"
"May 5, 2016","cannot get into the site. No matter what I try it wilk not let me log in or create an account. Another failed amazon app"
"April 20, 2016","It works well! Someone seriously needs to resolve this Taylor Swift situation though. I mean, political issues are important and real but a lack of Taylor Swift anywhere is a problem of pretty significant magnitude as well. Go get her!"
"August 22, 2016","Every time an ad plays, mostly the mountain dew ad, the app resets and/or stops. Do you think you can fix it? It the best app. I would recommend it to everyone."
"September 27, 2017","Love it! They have so much music on here and I love that I make a playlist and have what ever I want on it and that it will give you suggested songs to add to your playlist."
"January 30, 2017","WHY SPOTIFY? Spotify allow you to create your own Playlist. Listen to unique radio stations, & share music with your friends. The steps are easy in creating your own account.'"
"May 26, 2017","The app has a lot of genres of music to choose from, but sometimes the ads get to be a bit much. Sometimes the ads will break the flow of the app because it got stuck loading but never loads."
"September 11, 2015","This new up date sucks now spotify is like Pandora but you can add all your favorite songs. You have a skip limit unless you pay to be a member, you can't have songs on repeat unless your a member, and you can pick the songs you want to play u must use shuffle unless you are a member. Spotify change back other wise more people might go to Pandora."
"August 16, 2017","Awesome love it!!!!!"
"August 10, 2015","This app is the best to listen to your music. Pandora isn't good if you don't have an email. This is the best app you can get to listen to your music when you want. I love it. I can now listen to my favorite band whenever I want. This is the best thing you can ever get!"
"March 1, 2017","PC and android apps are slow, fragile, and hang often. They also do not understand what random play means."
"July 19, 2017","It would be far better and I would give it a perfect rating if it had more free use instead of most of it being premium features that have to be paid for. I'm not paying money to use an app. Sorry ain't happening. What should have been free is the ability to make a playlist and also search for actual songs and play just single songs and that stuff isn't fee. It's a good app but it's not the best especially for those folks who don't have spare money to waste."
"September 25, 2017","This app is very dependable it always works and you can listen to music whenever you want"
"May 3, 2017","free music."
"August 14, 2014","Gotta love the quality of the streamed music, the vast library and the freedom to choose and listen to tracks, albums, lists or ""radio"".  Finding one's way around the various menus as well as the reliability of the search function might be improved but no major complaints overall.  I appreciate all of the various music services but Spotify has quickly become our favorite of the bunch."
"September 12, 2017","My fiance introduced me to Spotify and I'm completely addicted now!"
"September 10, 2015","I really like both spotify and pandora, but I love the option of different folders on spotify. Although my spotify seems to freeze a lot and when I restart it the same songs play over again then I get frustrated and turn it off. Annoying when in the shower or working out."
"July 17, 2017","So far I love it!!!"
"February 14, 2017","It works well but sometimes the app bugs out but after that you gotta watch another ad, some ads are like 1 minute and 30 seconds long for some reason also"
"September 6, 2017","unable to download"
"July 15, 2016","Best Music Streaming app. I've tried all of them from Apple to Tidal and the eaiset one to use is this one. While the other two have exclusives they all eventually come to Spotify."
"October 26, 2014","I highly recommend this app. You can like all the songs you like from stations and put them all into one playlist and then shuffle all the songs! Unlike Jango and Pandora. This app is amazing and there is no other better music app. Get this app if you like music ! ^.^"
"August 28, 2017","Worth paying for"
"January 10, 2016","This is is amazing for all types of people.... if your into gospel, pop, r&b, rap, hip pop, country, calm, energetic, techno, etc. whatever genre it is...it's there!! I fall asleep to all of my favorite music, artists, or genres....overall it's amazing!! Also, for premium it's $0.99 for 3 MONTHS!!!!"
"March 17, 2017","Lovvvvveeee it so much!!!! The best music app ever. It's totally easy to use. It has all the latest songs."
"March 26, 2017","Ok"
"May 31, 2017","Great app..wish multiple users at one time was easier, by overall great app."
"May 25, 2017","I like the app and the music is free. But sometimes the freezes. But other then that specify is the perfect app to download and get great and free music. So it is a great app."
"August 19, 2015","Normally, with this kind of app you can't put custom songs into one playlist like iheartradio or pandora, so since this app allows you to do that along with what iheartradio and pandora (not mentioning a few others), it is definitely the best music app to have."
"August 26, 2017","Love listening to my music. Getting is membership is worth it! Download playlists and listen to them without WiFi."
"October 12, 2017","Its fantastic for premium its like having an endless supply of music new and old. But if you want massups and custom remixes you'll have to go elsewhere sadly."
"July 30, 2015","Overall great, no problems added from iTunes and other mp3 so all is in one place."
"September 21, 2015","I really enjoy using Spotify I have it for every device I own✌❤"
"August 14, 2016","Great app. With the Fire tablet, even plays on-demand songs in the free version! Not so with the free Android version, but, still love it."
"December 21, 2016","I love it and use it every day, but is slightly glitchy and has the tendency to stop playing music and only says, ""Get Premium to play ad-free music."" When this happens, restart device as many times as necessary."
"September 13, 2015","omg jontron ft shmoyoho titenic is on here amazing along with dagames fnaf songs and living tombstone's songs, perfect app for anyone who likes any one of thoses,AND MUCH MORE,my final thoughts, YOU COULD CALL THIS APP 10/10 AND NOONE WILL ARGUE WITH YOU,cant forget the flying eggplant"
"November 6, 2017","What's so great about Spotify? Well you get to pick what ever songs you want replay your songs and play them offline anytime ."
"September 4, 2017","Could not find any classical music. Bombarded with ""pop"" music which was of no interest."
"October 1, 2014","Words can't describe how wonderful it is to hear songs from childhood, or songs from life's pivotal moments alongside the strange and bizzare x I absolutely love it. Every taste is catered for, and being introduced to New artists based on listening habits is a touch of genius.........opens up endless possibilities, for both artist and listener. Worth every penny."
"January 12, 2017","Love the recommendations and the 🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎵🎤🎤🎤🎵🎤🎵🎻🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶🎵🎤🎤🎵🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶🎼🎶🎶🎶🎼🎶🎶🎶🎷🎺🎹🎻🎸📻📻📻📻📻📻📻"
"September 7, 2014","Wow I absolutely love this app so much ! I didn't know what it was until I downloaded if and BAM ! My life was transformed! This is an incredible app for all type of music and its even better than both Pandora and iHeart radio ! I couldn't believe the variety of music genre I could play and plus it also has a radio ! Like whaaaaaaa ! Absolutely amazing <3"
"September 20, 2017","Good music. Easy to set up."
"August 30, 2017","I've found nearly all recordings I've searched for. Very impressive considering I search the classical and contemporary concert recordings!"
"July 5, 2016","Awesome, I definitely recommend it for most anyone who wants to listen to whatever music they want. You can make a playlist with literally any song there is out there. It's amazing, 5 stars."
"January 31, 2017","Pros: To many to say Cons: I can't view all songs by an artitst"
"January 3, 2017","Great music app!"
"October 9, 2017","Great music"
"August 9, 2017","Doesn't work."
"April 15, 2017","Great music Can't play without WiFi unless u download songs Otherwise great"
"March 16, 2017","Super great app. Has every song I look app. I recommend this app."
"August 13, 2017","I can't even listen to music anymore because it has locked up on one ad and won't move on. Also the kindle fire doesn't really have a way for you to restart apps. In fact, all the apps on kindle fire are absolutely terrible."
"March 22, 2017","I love the music and how simple it is to make your own playlist. That being said, it is very frustrating the way that they've increased the ads on their free version..."
"May 5, 2015","Although the access to a vast variety of music is excellent, it very often doesn't open or freezes. It never works in my car despite the fact that my phone is Bluetooth linked. I pay monthly for service. The screen is either black or gives the message proceed offline. I can only play music while in house."
"July 25, 2017","It is way better than Pandora it has a better variety and is perfect to listen to on long car trips I 💞 it so much!!!!!"
"July 22, 2017","Awesome"
"October 12, 2015","I hate that they don't have all the songs like they have there other songs but not the one I'm looking for I don't get it. I'm hating that I can't play the song I have to click shuffle like it's fine with my playlist but when I'm searching you don't need to do that. Over all I love it but now I'm just getting annoyed with it."
"February 9, 2016","Spotify never disappoints! I have it on kindle fire, laptop, and mobile phone. Easy to use, great quality, and simple to customize and large selection ofmusic. I have so many fave artists that I discovered from Spotify suggestions. Thanks!"
"November 9, 2014","It was amazing to type in the name of an artist and instantly listen to whatever I wanted to play--no interruptions--that was truly exciting."
"May 19, 2017","I miss grooveshark."
"April 6, 2017","Guys and women. This is the best music app that can be made. It has any genre you would want. From R&B to hip-hop, punk heavy metal, etc. And when I say everything I mean everything"
"February 5, 2016","Spotify is a wonderful app I like it very much! It is easy to find your favorite music and artists + more. Apps like Pandora are hard for me to use because you can't find the features easily. I highly suggest spotify for a music loving person like you!! 😄😄😄😄🍉🌼🍇🍍🌈🌸🍓🍁🌷"
"February 20, 2015","Spotify is apart of my everyday life. I have tried the others but found that I always come back to where I love. I am a person that loves music , this gives me the chance to hear a song , gives me variety and adds new songs to my playlist . I get to hear what I want to , when I want to, no commercials . It is everything I expect from my mucis and more.. I'm addicted .."
"March 17, 2016","This app is fantastic ,I can listen to all my fav songs and artist .as well as all their albums and latest songs .it's also nice to not have to constantly skip songs ,because sometime it's just nice to listen that certain song you want to hear at the time being . but anyways I love this app"
"September 7, 2017","Still missing some pretty popular music, gets very glitchy when using with multiple devices.Songs that I downloaded are suddenly not downloaded. My library fluctuates if I'm on wi-fi, songs that I removed keep coming back into my library, not very user friendly."
"January 13, 2016","I have no problems with this app. It has all the music I like. It created my own playlist for me with all my favourite songs and its easy and fast if you want to just find more music"
"July 22, 2017","I really enjoy Spotify. Tons of music, playlists created for you based on your interests, new music suggestions weekly. Two thumbs up!"
"March 24, 2016","Ever since the new update my spotlight has been downloading every song I have saved. Which would be fine but it's using up all my storage. I've tried everything I can to combat this problem but it keeps happening. I loved the app before but now it's aggravating me."
"August 24, 2017","As per music ratio is way too much. It says thirty minutes of free music, but I've timed it several times. If I've ever gotten twenty minutes I'd be surprised."
"July 9, 2014","This is a good app. Spotify is better with a subscription since it allows you to download and listen to it offline. I was able to cancel sat radio and limit my streaming on my cell with spotify. I took advantage of the student price for my subscription. The only issue I have is that I listen to a wide range of music. One of my favorite genre is kpop. I am not able to find much to download."
"January 28, 2017","I love 💘 that i can play my own music!"
"January 12, 2017","Can't believe I waited so long to download this app!!! Easy to navigate - but not sure can run thru Alexa without paid membership...either way - free one is good enough !"
"July 25, 2017","I can lisyen to all my music thi is the best😀😁"
"September 23, 2015","Loved the app up until it's recent update. Now I have to shuffle through my 100 plus song playlists to listen to the one I want. Or if you want to listen to the charts and see a new song you have to go through it all to listen to the newest one. Love the app but definitely needs to go back to select a song and listen!"
"April 17, 2015","When I couldn't find any other music app that worked, I turned to Spotify. This app is the best music app. It is so simple to use, has great sound quality, and has almost any song you could think of, old or new. I highly recommend this app. When I want music, I am so happy that I found Spotify. BEST MUSIC APP EVER!"
"February 23, 2015","Great way to listen to your favorite music! I just wish it had a sleep timer. It would be nice to fall asleep listening to my music. I bought the 99¢ membership deal that lasts 3 months (a special they had going during December). It's nice not having the commercials play and being able to select the song I want to listen to on my phone."
"July 23, 2017","'I don't like it I hate it it is not good quality stops at too many times app won't open at all I don't like it at all I hate"
"August 15, 2017","Its better then Pandora and fast to use Ten out of ten would use Again"
"December 20, 2014","This is a good app. I think the only fall back is not being able to skip songs as many times as I want but other than that it's a great app."
"July 18, 2017","Love the discover weekly playlist! Bring up songs I'd totally forgotten about! 99% of the time I find the exact song I am looking for. Keep up the good work!"
"July 26, 2017","This is the best music app! Almost all songs are on here (a rare few are not) Great for work or sleep. Only thing is how many adds there are when you do not have a premium account. (However I have premium so it might of changed) I would totally recommend this app."
"August 25, 2014","I've tried all the major streaming music services and this one is the best ... especially in terms of sheer amount and genres of music. Rock to Pop to Opera to Classical to Gospel Quartets: it's got it all. And pretty much ALL the recorded albums in every category. Easy but versatile interface, too. Build collections of favorites in numerous different ways. I love it."
"July 9, 2015","I love being able to create my own albums, as well as downloading albums of favorite soundtracks and artists. My options are as numerous as the stars in the sky! What's not to like about Spotify?!!"
"July 25, 2017","I'm listening too it right now. It has good quality and it's very good, I'm listening to Left behind (this is so laughing jacks theme song. :-) I really like this app! You don't have to sign up, and there is like every single song! I love itt!!!"
"August 9, 2017","This is such a good deal I feel guilty like I'm stealing the music and it ROCKS !"
"July 26, 2017","Great place to find great songs"
"December 31, 2016","Compared to iTunes, where it is at least a dollar per song, I pay 10 bucks a month and have unlimited downloads. For the amount of downloads I have the money is well worth it. I recommend the service!"
"January 28, 2017","Love it, need to have it."
"September 4, 2016","App is only worth it with premium, if you have free you can only shuffle albums. But 10 dollars a month (5 if you're a student) is worth it for anyone who obsessively listens to music. Has pretty much everything you'd ever want."
"May 29, 2017","I like the fact that you couldn't listen to the whole album not like Pandora they pick your music not you.  I really appreciate it thank you"
"August 14, 2017","Spotify is awesome"
"June 17, 2017","Because of Spotify, I will never use Pandora again. Spotify is great, because it allows you to build your own playlist(s) and you're not forced to listen to songs that really don't suit your mood. I have Spotify on all of my devices."
"January 8, 2015","I love this app but I can't find Taylor Swift no matter how hard and long I search for her. Also I can't seem to figure out how you buy spotify premium could you make it a bit easier? This app contains amazing music, and I love being able to make a playlist with all the music I love. WAY BETTER then iheartradio."
"August 17, 2017","I love that you can play anything you want but when it comes time for the commercial it won't play it so you can't listen to another song"
"January 15, 2017","This has always been my favorite music app! I can listen to what I want when I want, and the quality is magnificent! I recommend hhis for anyone who's looking for free music!"
"June 28, 2016","This is an amazing app where you can listen to ALL kinds of music, not just pop or modern country. I actually listened to the Beatles! Good job Spotify!!😁"
"August 18, 2017","Bummer reqired me to download amazon apps and neither will allow you to move them to an SD card ...space is at a premium and work apps get priority"
"July 25, 2017","Best music app out there and it's cheap I use it everyday!!!!! Every song Every Where And Any Time!!!!"
"September 2, 2017","I love Spotify. It is very convenient. I love how you can arrange the songs Into the order you want. Definetly a five star app!!!!"
"November 10, 2017","It OK but u must have wifi"
"August 5, 2017","Its amazing can listen to any artist any song some new songs and stuff is not gonna be there but there's always the replay button"
"August 31, 2017","Great assortment of music. Great sound quality."
"October 1, 2015","I love this music app it's really cool and awesome. Did you know that you pay only $10 a month for music everywhere with no ads but you can purchase the free app without the no limits and it's still pretty cool. Only $10 a month!!!"
"October 15, 2014","Plz get this it is great if you love music. Even if you don't like most songs and you just like a few songs thats ok because Spotify has about every song you can think of.My whole family loves Spotify and listens to it all the time in the car at the house and at other people's houses if you have the acount that cost money."
"August 10, 2016","It's amazing but I wish it was all free ..other then that it's an atm app that allows u to listen to all the music you love and enjoy 😊"
"June 26, 2016","This is a great app and it is soooo much better than sound cloud. I wish they could have more updates on artist. But over all it is a great app. I would totally recommend spotify!"
"July 1, 2016","Great App, will get you almost any song for free. It's like the radio, but you choose the songs!😀"
"July 1, 2016","I love it!! Its useful for when I want to listen to music... But my yt can't let me especially when I'm playing mcpe... Or happy jump!"
"May 7, 2015","I have the app on my phone, pc and fire TV. It was working great until they upgrade the system on the fire TV and stopped working, it keeps give me an error message... That something went wrong. I'm hoping that they can fix the problem, I'm paying for the app and I can't use it."
"April 17, 2017","I love this app I use it all the time for all my music listening needs. I love it so much"
"November 25, 2015","Great stuff."
"September 11, 2014","refuses to download on Kindle Fire. Green bar progresses, finishes, and then says download failed. Tried several times, have sufficient memory and fast internet connection. I'm moving on"
"December 12, 2014","Spotify is very good. The Kindle Fire HD app works OK, not as well as the Mac or PC versions, but better than the Roku app version."
"August 9, 2014","I really do love this app. It's fun, easy to use, and they have a huge selection of awesome songs. But there is one thing that bothers me. They say you to upgrade to get certain features, but there's no upgrade button! If you were asking me, I'd say get the app, but watch out for a few things."
"March 5, 2016","Awesome I Love using this it works very well. I would suggest this app to all my friends especially those that have a ps4. I like being Abel to download songs for offline listening it is very convenient. I would like to see more selection though."
"October 30, 2016","Spoifly is an easy and safe download. The navigation to your music genre of choice gives one ample choices. Advertisements are moderate and what you would expect from a free down!oad."
"December 18, 2015","This is by far the best way to listen to music for free anytime. You can listen to any genre of music whenever. It has billions of songs to listen to at you´r fingertips. 100% A Five STAR MUST HAVE!!"
"November 26, 2016","I like being able to listen to free music but, I don't like the idea of not being able to listen to music without WiFi"
"April 20, 2016","Ok so you select all the music you want to hear and you can organize it anyway you want playlist, shuffle etc and all you have to deal with is a thirty second ad every thirty minutes their not even that bad it's so worth it way better than iTunes"
"July 31, 2016","Awesome app! Let's me listen pretty much anywhere. Couldn't be happier with any other music service."
"November 2, 2016","I LOVE SPOTIFY!!!😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 I CAN LOOK UP MY FAVORITE SONGS FOR F.R.E.E. BEST MUSIC APP EVER THANKYOU FOR MAKING THIS"
"October 6, 2015","There is a lot of music and Spotify has a lot of music sorted for just about anything you can think of! Running, pop, etc. You won't get bored of listening to the same thing because there is so much much. Spotify is the BEST! You should get it.😎"
"November 5, 2016","Spotify is a great music app. I love all the different types of music there. They have pop, rock, rap, classical, and so much more. They have the top hits. And if you go premium then you can listen to it when ever adds free. Its a great app and its really nice for what ever mood your in. Hope you enjoy this app too!"
"July 18, 2016","I love this.app I use.it on all of my electronic devices and if you us.a.tablet it basically comes with premium cause you can tap a song and not have.to press shuffle"
"November 14, 2016","this thing is great I totaly recommend it"
"June 30, 2015","I enjoy spotify. I do not enjoy that there can be only one user at a time, with an option to purchase another family user at another 4.99 a month. That part of it kills the experience for me, as I am paying 9.99 a month and only one of us can listen to music at a time. I think they ought to at least allow two users per subscription, much as Netflix does."
"October 22, 2017","It's a great format for your music."
"July 3, 2016","Spotify is the legit best Music app in the business because I have had no problems with this program what so ever and I listen to my music everyday! So its great the app is here !!!"
"March 29, 2016","For some reason spotify decided it wont play more than one song at a time. It just goes sient at the end of that song. I pay for it, yet its actually become worse than the free version..."
"March 28, 2017","The advertisements will always be the death of me!! But Spotify's gotta make money, right?"
"December 29, 2014","Love that you can listen or download any song that was every but out. You can even listen to the whole CD or album. You can listen even listen to it offline for a low monthly fee to. It also have radio station you can listen too. Will recommend this app to anyone. I really enjoy this app."
"August 31, 2017","Easy to use and endless variety of music"
"June 13, 2017","The memberships cost money"
"August 6, 2017","It is very helpful it has a lot of songs."
"August 23, 2017","Ever thing ilov together ;-) 👍"
"August 3, 2014","While I love spotify, this app has a few glitches. Sometimes when I play a song, it won't have any sound, which gets rather irritating after a while. I also have found that spotify on apple devices (iPad, iPhone) is extremely better to navigate and easier to use. If kindle can make the layout more like that, I would change the rating to 5 stars."
"September 10, 2015","I love this app for its wide selection on free music, but I hate the way it works. Why do I have to pay money for me to be able to hear the songs I want to hear when I want to!?! Since the last update for the kindle version, I have to click shuffle to go through EVERY song I saved to find the one I want to hear. Thats just ridiculous. I think i'll find an app that I can listen to music that I want to hear. Ha! Forget it im going back to pandora!"
"July 26, 2016","The best music app I have gotten. Every song that I want"
"February 7, 2015","Its a good app and good music and stuff but i dont know where to upgrade to make so the music doesnt sound weird its all staticy. Im using the kindle fire so idk if its different but please help its all wierded up. but other than that its a good app"
"March 28, 2016","Easy to use,has all the songs you can imgaeon,great because you can be on another app or something and your music will still be playing.for example if your on Spotify and have a song or playlist playing you can be on faceQ and tour song or songs will still play :D most of them don't do that.Overall,....AWSOME!"
"September 5, 2017","Spotify makes it's so easy to get your favorite music and share it"
"August 14, 2016","This app has amazing ratings and it has all kinds of playlists but I'd u want to make your own they have thousands of choices for that matter. Definitely a great pick. 😂"
"April 6, 2015","Finally an app that has an option to take away the gaps between songs. So when you finish one the next one starts right away. It also has a crossover fade to easily transition between songs as well. Amazing app. And not to mention the offline mode... genius!!!!"
"October 16, 2014","I think this app is brilliant , it has a Apple look to it and I use it all the time. That being said I only scored it 4/5 and this is because you have to have a internet connection to use it luckily I have a kindle and I don't take it out much, but I wouldn't be able to use it on a phone for this reason."
"September 17, 2015","I was amazed with spotify at first, i could skip all the songs i eanted and i could play whatever song i wanted even without permium. Then i got the update... i am highly frustrated with the new update you can only skip a few songs and cant play the songs you want. Spotify WAS better than pandora but not anymore."
"August 28, 2016","This app is amazing! I can listen to countless songs that I really like. Its similar to Pandora except you actually choose the song you listen too. I love it!"
"May 28, 2016","Love it but threads are what's getting the app"
"October 8, 2015","I'll make this review easy to read and simply say that Spotify is the best paid for or free with ads music service. It's easy and dark UI is easy to understand and nativate. You'll love the crossfade feature and use it every song. Try out the best money (or no money) can get you. SPOTIFY!"
"February 3, 2017","I love Spotify. Whether you heard a song yesterday or when you were a kid Spotify has it. 🎀 It is very convenient it has a shuffle feature and you can create albums."
"February 1, 2017","Spotify is awesome. Sucks that the songs aren't un alphabetical order so I could find one easily but otherwise its great. I can find almost any song, any album, any artist"
"November 5, 2017","Introduces lots of artists that are new. So there is music beyond classic rock that is great but i just hadn't been exposed."
"December 19, 2016","Love this app. Get to listen to all my favorite songs on one list. My only issue is it seems to freeze more often then i'd like. I restart my phone and that doesn't fix it. I use it in my car with bluetooth and after so long it randomly pauses and i have to open it up while driving just to unpause it. Other then thoes issues. I love that you can just listen to the songs you like and not just the type of music."
"November 14, 2015","I like it a lot but the only thing that is bothering me is that I am not able to pick my own songs to listen to. If I click the song the shuffle play box pops out at me so I click it and it plays a whole entire different song. I also can't skip the song when it comes on."
"January 5, 2015","Wish I could have had this year's ago. I love the discover feature that suggest new albums. Better selection than other apps, and more hard to find artists than I could have ever imagined in an app. Never crashes, and uses very little data."
"September 1, 2017","All of my favorite music whenever wherever it awesome I definitely recommend this app"
"September 13, 2015","I updated Spotify a few days ago, and now you have limited skips. When I first got this app I liked it because it wasn't like any other music app. You could choose and skip any song you wanted but if you update it takes that away. I hope it turns back to normal soon."
"October 28, 2017","It is so good it helps so much with every. I 💗 spotify"
"August 19, 2014","I love all kinds of music and to be able to stream anything you like is just incredible. Especially as it comes free.  Just search for your favourite track and download it, to play anytime and anywhere you like. Classical, modern, whole albums. It's all there, making CD' s a thing of the past."
"June 12, 2017","Really love the fact that you can choose whatever music you want to hear and you can just about listen to everything classical to rock to rhythm and blues and jazz have no complaints love it"
"April 19, 2017","Great!!!!!!!!!😀"
"January 13, 2015","This is far better then iHeart Radio because if you tap on a certain song in that app then it'll open an album that has mixed music that doesn't even have the same artist's songs. I deleted iHeart Radio right when I played my favourite songs. This is amazing!!!"
"June 26, 2015","This is such a great thing to use for music, better than Pandora in my opinion! Choose your own music from tons of different songs. The only down side is the ads but that is okay! Choose Spotify Music and you can listen to your music all the time."
"April 2, 2015","It has all of the music I love plus you can find just about anything just by searching. Falling to sleep to the nature sounds or thunder and rain has made me sleep much better. Waking up to my favorite tunes or discovering new favorites in the morning before work is priceless. Thank you Spotify!"
"October 21, 2017","You can listen to music while drawing!"
"September 1, 2017","This app is the best!! Even better with a premium subscription!"
"July 24, 2016","I was listening to another music app and someone encouraged me to try Spotify. I'm glad I took their advice!"
"August 28, 2016","Pretty good selection and play."
"March 10, 2016","I get stress easy, so to have this app that have music to calm me is very handy specially when there's no WiFi. At first I hate spending the amount a month but so worth it."
"February 16, 2016","doesn't work on my fire phone, sucks"
"July 28, 2017","Spotify has tons of great music but when you go to different apps while listening to a song it stops playing and you have to go back to the app. Also those ads that are supposed to give 30 minutes of add free music play almost after every song you listen to. I hate to say it but I might go back to SoundCloud"
"July 26, 2017","Looooovvee"
"December 28, 2014","it 1.i can create playlists 2.i can add songs to playlists 3 playlist and songs available offline 4but when i tap a song to play on my kindlefire 7 it will not let me 5 have installed and unstalled many of times nothing and checked all setting please up am playersunshinex@yahoo.com"
"March 13, 2017","Its ight but I don't know its cool😳👙i mean it has to be letting me know and sometimes the music randomly stops out of nowhere and well yeah..."
"November 4, 2014","Not only does it have all the music you'd ever want to hear... it has tons of music you've never even heard of. This is the best music application I've ever used. Pandora is nice but you have little choice in what song you get to hear, Spotify gives you the power to choose."
"January 13, 2017","its about all i listen to, awesome ,no problem .listening to all the music i love ,able find it and to my play list and listen anywhere. love it!!!!!"
"June 16, 2016","i like the app i jus wish they would put something on there to turn of the shuffle play even if u dont hav the premium version"
"August 20, 2017","Great app  huge choice In music Easy to use"
"November 2, 2017","Good app. But I can't buy premium so I can't listen offline.😊"
"August 30, 2017","Love it! Great way to personalize my own playlists and hear the music I want to hear."
"November 10, 2017","They kinda change it where u can change ur music yourself"
"September 2, 2016","Every time I heard that the wold is a village and when I try to use this app, I have a smartphone Galaxy S7 edge, a Internet connection 4G Lte I live in the caraibean region I received a error message that my country is not eligible. Just let me understand"
"March 31, 2015","I love Spotify and all the ready-to-play playlists! All the songs are great. I can find any song I want to listen to, play it, download it, or put it on a playlist. Overall, Spotify is a great app and I give all thanks to whoever developed it!"
"October 2, 2017","Best music app I have ever seen and you can listen to what ever when ever you want"
"January 8, 2016","Love this!!!!! Also, if you're a musician or just love playing around with music, you need to check this out! It's amazing!! http://9c873tv5f70q7ka28i0lqa2z2w.hop.clickbank.net/"

"July 11, 2016","Good"
"February 2, 2015","every review you see they all say the same what an app it finds songs every time a must if you like music I just click on rock and play the first song then every tune listed in that Category plays one after another even tunes ive not heard of brilliant"
"June 3, 2015","This music make every bone of your body to dance and enjoy the ride,John Christian remix and town called paradise with Tiesto ,make you scape the reality and have good time.I'm enjoyed music of any kind,trust me in this,this is the best thing I do,I love it,Thelma."
"September 2, 2017","Love the music! And it plays within my playlist!! :)"
"August 1, 2014","There are a ton of things this app does right, but then there are some things that just make me grind my teeth. Really need to fix the inability to filter and queue a song and stay within your current playlist. Right now when you filter a playlist and queue a song out of that filter it lines it up to play next, but drops every song after that."
"December 22, 2016","I use it every day while driving. My OWN music. Better than satellite radio or any other imo."
"September 28, 2015","I got problems to update th app on 28 sept 2015. Up to now was working very well but from some days is giving me problems and today already is updating and Uninstaller by itself. So I have no spotify at all!!! What's up!!!???????? I can't be without!"
"April 4, 2016","It's okay for listening to music. The music quality isn't particularly outstanding unless you purchase Spotify Premium, in which case, you enjoy many options for streaming quality and you are allowed unlimited skips, which is a big plus."
"November 22, 2016","good"
"October 29, 2017","Spotlight is good but their is a skip limit and I can't get spotify premium."
"August 6, 2017","Very awesome to listen to they have alllll the music I need!!!! DOWNLOAD PLZZZZZZ!!!!!!"
"April 23, 2016","I love that I can save all music and I can hear it off-line if needed. It's saves me a lot of data and battery even when I have it on airplane mode. I have so many music saved and it doesn't affect my phone at all. I love this app"
"August 13, 2017","Love to listen to music because I have to block people from me because the."
"January 31, 2017","Easy to navigate. Easy to download to listen. An app that works and the setup makes sense"
"January 9, 2017","this app is awesome. you need this app i your:going to sleep,going on a run,going to a park,if your bored and your brother is hoghing the t.v,if your walking home from school,if your walking To school,if its a cool day outside and you just want to chill out there (they even have a section of chilling music),and if your mom and brother are watching real husbands of hollywood and completly ignoring you. this app is good for anything."
"December 27, 2014","Excellent stuff. No music lover, whether it's Bryan Ferry or Chopin should be without spotlight. Greatest feature? You can listen to new bands or composers you don't know and get to know a helluva lot of music of which you would otherwise be ignorant."
"October 17, 2015","This app is really amazing, but in the new version I can´t choose the song I want to hear, and that upsets me, but either way it is a good app, although I hope they will change a few things in the future."
"July 23, 2017","This app is perfect if you want listen to a certain artist for a while."
"November 24, 2016","This app is a very good music app. I only wish that you could download music and listen to specific songs for free."
"June 3, 2016","Spotify gives me everything I want. Not more than I need. more is available for those who want more. I have never searched for music that Spotify did not have, and I've done some searches for old (50-60 yrs) and rare music."
"August 30, 2017","The music app that broke people will enjoy"
"August 14, 2017","I love spotiffy I can listen to any music I want to😊😃😺"
"December 5, 2014","Unbelievably good"
"August 27, 2015","Lately, whenever ads try to play, a black screen shows up and it stays stuck like that indefinitely. I have to delete Spotify and redownload it a lot. I can't even try to switch between music since it says the ad is still playing. Please fix this."
"October 6, 2014","I am very impressed at the amount of music that is available and at a low cost. The 1 month trial period does allow literally hundreds of tracks to be had on my devices. If this continues the way that it is now, then I am definitely all for it. Thanks for this great idea, best yet in music distribution.."
"August 16, 2016","I like everything about Spotify .. Easy to use . has filled EVERY request and I'm a jazz fan ! Get to the track you want virtually instantly"
"May 1, 2016","This is so cool because you can do music while you are in a app.  App cool because you do music.😐😑😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😑😄😄"
"November 24, 2016","It is a good app but their are some flaws . They need to allow you to skip without having to get premium.$_$"
"October 5, 2014","Appeared by magic on my Kindle when I thought my original Spotify account was a fond memory. A very welcome return. The ads used to annoy me, but they seem less frequent than I remember. Am enjoying the superb range of music and checking out the themed playlists."
"January 9, 2015","Great in all aspects, free version is find. Kindle sound adequate. Superb with a cheap Bluetooth speaker or headphones. Music selections available unbelievable. Very pleased with product. Some ads, I find them unobtrusive."
"August 19, 2017","I can listen to what ever I want by just typing it in"
"November 14, 2014","This app is awesome because you can find any music Latino and classics any just type in the author and all the artists music's come out just get this app and I swear if you don't like it well just write you opinion.oh and you have to make an account"
"September 23, 2017","Need it, it's great!!"
"December 28, 2016","I like the layout of spotify, easy to navigate, and a great selection of music."
"October 15, 2017","Occasional ads can be annoying but makes great playlists for you."
"July 27, 2016","Great variety of all types of music to listen to free or to subscribe to a specific one for a monthly fee."
"November 27, 2016","Great App! I use it everyday, at home,work and in the car!"

"January 11, 2015","I love it you don't have to wait for songs to download only thing I can't figure out how to listen to offline if there is any possible way to. I use it on my Kindle and would like to be able to listen at work via Bluetooth but don't have access to WiFi at work. Other than that love it!!"
"October 6, 2014","This app allows you to search music and save it to play later. Create play lists or listen by the artist, album, or song! The only thing is that you have to have good Internet connection and after the first month you have to pay $10 per month, but you'll find its worth it!!!!"
"January 18, 2016","The only problem I have with the app is the premium. It costs ten dollars to get unlimited skips, non-shuffle mode, and a few other things. I think it's overpriced, but besides that its a great app."
"February 6, 2016","I was expecting this to be like Pandora, but it wasn't in the best way! I just get to binge on the artist of my choice, which is a beautiful thing"
"August 31, 2017","I'm a 72 year old and I think its great. A fantastic range of music."
"August 21, 2015","I have only one bad review for this. When I try to buy premium, it sends me to the internet browser and enter my credit card. I don't have a credit card, so I'm not able to get premium. :( Asides from that, everything is awesome. I'm able to find whatever music I want (except a lot of anime ops) and I only get a few adds. Way better than iTunes Radio and Pandora, if you ask me. If you ask a lot of people."
"August 20, 2017","I like this alot"
"November 23, 2016","I love my CDs but Spotify is a must have."

"August 2, 2014","This app is amazing. It as all my favorite songs and my parents. So wen I'm doing house work I can listen to music so I keep myself busy. This app is like totally something everyone should get. U can listen to it at any time with ur friends when it working or u can put on lullabies for ur babies when they have trouble sleeping it is a win win deal. And this music is for everyone. I hope u consider getting this app. And remember this is free."
"December 16, 2014","I got spotify it was ok then it said cannot play music offline and u have to get premium for that so when I went to get premium I couldn't find it"
"February 3, 2017","Listening to all my songs; great, all the adds, annoying"
"August 10, 2017","Has any song I want to listen to. Best music app ever!"
"September 26, 2015","The reason I loved Spotify was because it was different than other music streaming apps, because I could pick what songs I wanted to listen to. One of the more recent updates has taken that feature away, which is very displeasing and has largely lowered the quality of the app in my opinion. Please revert back."
"August 30, 2017","Awesome!!!!!"
"April 7, 2016","This app is awesome and it helps me get through homework all the time. This app had also helped me find new songs that I like😍"

"September 23, 2016","Not a bad app but it cuts out. Very similar to other apps I have had, but I really like the music lists. You have to contend with the advertisements, but overall it isn't bad."
"February 16, 2016","I really like Spotify. Their music selection is great for me and I like that there aren't too many commercials on the free version."

It works perfectly on my Kindle fire but on my phone it us the worst, I can't listen to one song separately,I have listen to a whole shuffle and you only have an skip song limite, and it is just horrible so it will want u to buy Spotify premium, but on my kindle it is THE BEST APP 😁😂😀so what I am saying is that it really just depends on what device u use or if u get Spotify premium. (Spotify premium cost money BTW)"
"July 31, 2017","Spoofing is awesome"
"June 1, 2016","Works well...but i cant figure out how to exit or close Spotify on the Fire TV....anyone know?"
"September 12, 2014","It runs a bit slow. Before you install it, remove the SD card first to prevent probleems with your offline playlist. After install, start the app then close it. Shutdown your BB and add your SD card again. Might run smoother on faster Blackberries like Z30."
"July 7, 2017","Good service if you are a music lover.  The app works perfectly and I can listen to great music all day."

"January 21, 2015","I love this app so much. All the songs I'm looking for are here, old and new. I can even play a whole album, an entire discography of an artist, and download unlimited songs. Premium is very worth it!"
"December 29, 2016","I love this app and its just amazing. It has lots of songs and space."
"September 9, 2015","This was the greatest free app for music I have ever found but the new promotion doesn't let you pick songs it's all random play. Thank you spotify I don't have to buy you now and I was going to"
"February 26, 2015","I wish I had known of spotify a long time ago. I've been using Pandora for music and a lot of times they play songs I'm not interested in. Spotify let's you pick the songs you want to hear and create your own playlists. I love it!!"
"June 16, 2017","Spotify is a wonderful on-deman music application...so long as you are willing to pay for premium. The free version is obnoxious with ads. But get a student premium account and you can enjoy Spotify at its finest for 4.99/month. I've had it on my iPhone for a while, and it works just as well or better on my HD Fire Tablet."
"July 26, 2016","I really love it. Its so great"
"January 12, 2017","Excellent!!!! I can listen all my fav songs"
"August 3, 2017","Great music app!"

"January 6, 2015","The experience with trying to access this Christmas gift from my son on the Kindle Fire was so pathetic and horribly frustrating compared to the other iOS mobile devices in my household I have virtually stopped using the Kindle Fire HD. Never could access my account as this app just kept freezing up."
"November 26, 2014","Every time I download a music downloader it says it is free and then you go to download some music AND IT ONLY GIVES YOU 7 DAYS!!!! I mean seriously music shouldn't cost music ð but besides that I guess it was ok"
"July 27, 2017","Auto plays in the car with no option to turn off. Uninstalled will come back on even after turning off .. Amazon prime music is my new go to..love it"
"August 27, 2017","Do not like at all, sorry. I don't like iTunes either, so maybe I am too old for this format."
"June 5, 2017","My kind of music like that I don't have to stop and say that I am till listening like I did with Pandora"
"August 9, 2016","This is the greatest music you could ever fing...all at your fingertips!"
"March 5, 2017","Spotify has carried me through so many tough days and nights. As a person with chronic pain music saves my life. I do miss the lyrics feature though."

"January 31, 2017","Best music app ever!!!"
"January 26, 2017","Best music choice that I have tried."
"March 24, 2016","Stops after two or three songs, even when entire playlist is downloaded. Uninstalled and reinstalled a couple times already, no luck. Love that I can create my own playlists. I subscribe to both Spotify and Pandora, one for playlists of specific songs I already know, the other when I want to explore stuff I haven't heard before."
"August 21, 2014","Spotify. Where have you been all my life? Maybe it's because I'm new to it, but I love it. And the sound quality on my Kindle Fire is fabulous. It's worth enduring the advertising to get this vast range of music for free."
"October 17, 2017","Greasy if you use premium, also go to family account if more than people are using it"
"December 9, 2016","Doesn't have most the music I like..."
"September 1, 2017","Love it"
"December 20, 2014","Not free at all. You have to subscribe to their service."
"June 10, 2016","Love Spotify! I can listen to music that I love online or offline, create playlists and so much more!!"

"July 5, 2016","It works really good. So if you want to listen to music of your choice for free then this app would be for you."

"December 21, 2015","Brilliant app, for just a tenner a month and play all the music I want in my opinion represents amazing value."
"August 14, 2017","I've tried several times to use this as my primary music application and it is not user friendly."
"January 24, 2017","I love the variety of music"
"May 15, 2015","Great app, you have a lot more control listening to the songs you actually want to hear rather than random songs like other music apps force you to listen to."
"September 1, 2017","Awesome app!!"
"June 8, 2016","Ads aren't shown too much. Premium is super cheap and totally worth it."
"October 2, 2014","I can never get any music from this app...I have to cancel it!!!"

"November 8, 2016","I LOVE this app, I wish the spotify premium was free but other than that it's great"
"December 3, 2015","This is great for Kindle, but why does Spotify require premium membership to use it on the Amazon Firestick?"
"November 24, 2014","It's amazing. It was easily downloaded to my iPhone and kindle and although I didn't expect, I found Welsh music as well. I love it. I just hope it lasts as it seems too good to be true."
"January 2, 2015","This is a great app it found new music for some of my favorite bands. The best part is that it's free, choose your music and stations wisely though, there is a daily skip limit."
"October 13, 2017","I truly enjoy using Spotify!! Excellent selection of Music selections!! Very organized and love how it finds songs that are old and new!!"
"August 15, 2017","Easy to use. Has all the music i need. I wish there were more skips that you don't have to pay for though."
"July 20, 2017","You can't download music unless you upgrade I don't know how to plusnypu can't get Beyonce formation and it won't work without WiFi make it better but over all I like it"
"October 28, 2015","Unable to play on demand on kindle only in shuffle mode. Kindle is a tablet not a mobile please will you fix this. At the beginning of October it worked why not now? Works on my mates iPad !"
"January 10, 2015","Brilliant all the album's I've wanted for years but not having the money to buy can now get for free , even the ads are short and doesn't impose on the music . Recommended !"

"March 17, 2017","Awsomeness"
"September 11, 2017","I am using this on Blackberry Passport and it works very good!"
"January 2, 2015","I have spotify on my home computer and it works great, but on my kindle fire I can only play music in shuffle mode. If I only have one song saved for an artist, I play shuffle mode and it plays some other song by the artist. If I wanted to have music chosen for me, I would have downloaded Pandora."
"January 13, 2017","Nothing better"
"September 13, 2015","I don't like the fact when the app updated it decreased my want for spotify because I no longer had unlimited skips because I had a kindle fire and I couldn't choose the song I want which is only a unique problem apparently. I will be switching to soundcloud which is way better."
"November 14, 2014","Very good but not as good as on my desktop. It does not let me control which of my favourites I play and it plays its own suggestions sometimes and I can't find how to skip them."

"July 19, 2016","the best way to listen, enjoy, re-discover and discover new and old music and artists. get this app now!"
"December 2, 2016","Use it daily!!"
"November 23, 2016","It's a pretty good app. Wish it didn't cost so much per month."
"November 5, 2017","Love the music"
"August 9, 2016","Have not fully learned all features of the app, I look forward to utilizing the app is the future."
"January 31, 2017","Awesome!!"
"June 24, 2017","It would't let me log on !!!!!!!"
"November 9, 2016","I love this app!!!"
"June 17, 2016","The offline feature saves a ton of data. Great app"
"April 28, 2016","Updates every couple of weeks but no improvements. Very slow."

"January 28, 2017","Great music"
"April 23, 2015","A great music app. Has almost every artist and you can personalize the app to your music taste as much as you would like.I really enjoy it"
"August 26, 2014","Commercials get a bit annoying on the free version. But what do you want for free. Has up to date hit songs, create multiple play lists, great app. Best music app I've used on my phone."
"November 8, 2016","Great music!"
"May 23, 2017","Amazing"
"June 21, 2016","wish it was longer but cool 2 minute pieces"

"January 31, 2017","AWESOME you can listen to every song"
"November 14, 2015","Only took 2 songs before I uninstalled it. Was looking for a station to create a romantic mood. Picked the country music love song station. After two songs a really annoying commercial for a hip hop station came on. A really long commercial at that. Really defeats the purpose for selecting that station."
"January 31, 2017","Not sure what I was doing without it for so long"
"August 1, 2017","Luuuvvvvv; a necessity for me."

"November 1, 2016","Love it"
"May 29, 2015","Spotify wanted to much guarded information about me to sign up."
"April 4, 2017","This is not nearly as good as Pandora I uninstalled it"
"December 17, 2015","I love this app, I've had many music apps and this one is by far the best!!!!"
"February 24, 2015","Interesting playlists and well chosen tracks. App works properly and is intuitive. Transfer is good and there is no problems with streaming."
"July 27, 2017","Bad color doesn't go with anything I own."
"December 8, 2014","Bought a premium membership during their $1 for 3 months promotion. The ability to create and share playlists is great. Way more features than Pandora."
"August 4, 2017","easy to navigate to your favorite music."
"August 4, 2017","Great app, one of the best sites around."
"November 2, 2014","Great service. Easy to use. Download and enjoy."

"March 31, 2015","does not work on kindel"
"July 31, 2015","impossible to get a specific song you want to play. I guess you have to subscribe. I have a buddy that has it on his iPhone and hey can play any song, no issue and without subscription. Search for a song and then all you can do is shuffle play and the song you wanted to hear may or may not play. Removing app."
"July 15, 2016","A lot of music for free"
"August 26, 2016","A great way to expand your musical horizons"

"March 6, 2016","The best, 😃😀😇"
"November 1, 2015","No good with out a code to work with Spotify."
"September 30, 2017","For free it is very good."
"October 3, 2014","Spotify is my new complete music collection. everything I want to listen to when I want to hear it! It is by far the best music streaming app I have used."
"August 3, 2014","I purchsed the app because its great and so i could use it on my smart tv. But I can not control the Tv app from another device as I can with youtube and others. Also, when I search a track the results will show playlists that the track appears in. Not on the Tv app though! Then on top of that, there is no radio option. Because I use the Tv app often these little features are huge."
"January 10, 2015","I use Spotify onmy laptop and love it. This app limits you to playlists. You can't listen to the song you want to hear without slogging through the other songs on the list."
"July 21, 2017","Good option for cheap music."

"July 23, 2016","Sweet"
"August 31, 2017","Worked before I updated the app on my kindle. Now it doesn't open at all, even if I uninstall + reinstall. Been using Spotify for at least 2 years now."

"February 25, 2016","Alright maybe once or twice, fine, but when you recommend the same beatboppy top of the charts crap that has nothing to so with what I'm listening to and causes me to not be able to work because I can't listen to just some simple tunes, sorry but deleted."
"July 25, 2017","Great way to find new music"
"April 30, 2016","This is Awesome!!!"
"September 22, 2017","Sorry"
"March 28, 2015","I can not rate the Spotify App. Unfortunately i was not able to down load it...good thing it was free!!"
"June 14, 2016","I just couldn't figure this out. I couldn't figure out how to play the songs I wanted in the order I wanted. I'll stick with Pandora."
"August 24, 2016","I'm really loving the versatility and vast selections of music. My son and I both find our favorites on here. Great portal for music and it works perfectly on my kindle fire, S7, and desktop. Love it!"
"January 24, 2016","Great for finding that elusive track!"
"March 7, 2016","Excellent and easy to use."

"May 29, 2017","Working well."
"November 8, 2014","They want too much private info to get started."
"August 28, 2015","Suffers in comparison to Apple music, especially pricing. Commercials on the free app are painful. Not impressed with search algorithm. Curated playlists are kinda meh compared to Songsta. Not the cleanest UI, controls should be clearly labelled, but then all music apps have serious UX issues for new users. No one should have to guess how an app as widely downloaded as this works."
"August 1, 2017","Good....free... music!"
"July 1, 2017","Yes it is 💋❤️"
"August 11, 2017","This app is amazing for a free music app the only downfall is that they don't have Taylor swift"
"August 28, 2017","the best!"
"May 28, 2016","Spotify is the best"
"February 8, 2015","Cannot fault this. Free music,anywhere, anytime what's not to like. Works perfectly on my Kindle Fire."
"July 28, 2017","But I wish you could keep the down loaded songs for 9.99 a month ."
"March 18, 2016","nice to listen to"
"June 14, 2017","not free"

"April 1, 2015","Lots of options, for me to pick from Latin music to pop and much more. Love spotify!!"
"June 16, 2014","When I first bought the app for free through the advise of my sister, I was thrilled by the number of skips and how many songs you could download. But turns out these are really members for premium members. All of my downloaded songs were deleted and I was not allowed to skip anymore. What I wonder is why can easily download songs on the computer but not on my Android phone. I understand that Spotify has gain some money, but I do not like this feature. Also. they play unrelated songs when your trial is over. You could get all the features you want, but only if you upgrade to premium membership."
"November 21, 2015","doesnt deserve one star. It doesn't work."

"July 15, 2017","Very difficult to understand how to link 5 different computers with Spotify Plus (or Prime). No instructions given. And every time that I go to another computer to try and add my five choices all that is provided prompts me to sign up for a trial membership for Spotify Premium well that is what I already purchased and paid for which is Spotify Premium so that leaves us customers in a wicked Loop nowhere are we fine provided instructions on how to load the product onto the five computers and Spotify Keeps Us in a loop referring us constantly to the trial membership which of course if I press that will charge me again which means double the membership price I would really appreciate some help with this dilemma thank you much"

"August 2, 2017","The app is all fine but when the Gap advertisement comes on, it doesn't play and I get stuck on that screen so I have to constantly force close the app. But that doesn't necessarily fix the problem because when I run the app again I have to listen to an ad to play music and more often than not it's that god foresaken Gap ad. I don't know if it's just me with the problem but honestly it's too much of a hassle just to play some music."

"July 17, 2017","Best song app ever"
"February 8, 2015","Super macht total spass"
"September 14, 2015","The premium is nice but the free version requires you to shuffle songs, which would be fine if it played more than two songs of the album or playlist that you wanted to shuffle before playing nothing but suggested songs for a while, and with only a couple opportunities to &#34;skip&#34;. So now you rarely listen to what you want (which is the point of music streaming), certainly rarely any particular song. You will be alarmed to try listening to Hozier only to instead become bombarded with suggested songs that you skip, so that you're out of skips when &#34;All About that Bass&#34; inexplicably appears to assault you with no escape."
"March 27, 2015","Love this app."

"October 20, 2017","A near perfect music app in almost every regard, if you're still using Pandora I highly recommend making the switch!"
"August 26, 2015","The functionality of this app is fine and I really enjoy Spotify, but how gimmicky is it to offer any song listening on tablets and desktops but exclude Fires as tablets, which was a strong point of me getting this tablet. I think this is absolutely absurd, and seems like a cash grab at Fire users, forcing us to go &#34;premium&#34; or relegate us to &#34;shuffle&#34; that free mobile users have to use. This is a big deal honestly. The Fires are tablets. Plain and simple, I should be able to choose whichever song I desire with the accompanying AD's. CHOOSE A DIFFERENT STREAMING SERVICE. SPOTIFY IS NOT HONEST IN ADVERTISEMENT."
