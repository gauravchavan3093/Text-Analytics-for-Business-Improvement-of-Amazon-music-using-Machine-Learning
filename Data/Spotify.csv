"on October 7, 2017","Spotify is way, way, way, way, way, way better music app than Pandora. It doesn't limit you on the musicians you actually like with awful musicians with a few of your favorite songs peppered in between garbage pail cousin music and brown water trash one hit wonders. Spotify let's you play whole albums and let's you make custom and endless playlists."
"on April 4, 2017","I love, love, love spotify !!!!! I'm 71 years and no very computer literate, if I can learn Spotify anyone can. I have found songs I used to listen to 55 years ago."
"on March 7, 2017","I love this app. I've tried them all (apple, amazon, pandora) and nothing compares. The suggestions are awesome, I'm finding new music all the time. Also, you can pick up where you left off on any device. Spotify is the best, period."
"on July 31, 2016","I love this app. I put it on my phone first, but I had so much music it was taking up all the room on my phone. I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version. Either way, you have access to lots of great music from your favorite artists."
"on April 29, 2017","Great for listening to your favorite tunes and discovering new ones as well"
"on April 24, 2017","It is such a good app I fecomed this to anyone who love music"
"on October 14, 2017","Listening to music on demand has never been better than it is with Spotify. The app not only provides access to thousands of classic tracks, but it provides great recommendations for music you might like based on your listening history. Highly recommended!"
"on June 7, 2017","I really like being able to pull up my favorite songs and adding them to a playlist. I also really like how it recommends new music for me based on what I already listen to."
"on December 27, 2016","this literally has almost every song i have ever searched. plus offline mode is amazing!!"
"on April 10, 2016","This app is wonderfully diverse in its music content. You can create your own playlist or listen to individual songs. Typing in an artist name reveals lots of albums and hit songs."

"on June 4, 2017","This app is amazing and you don't even have to get a premium account to get access to great music!"
"on July 13, 2016","I switched to Spotify from Pandora because I wanted to be able to choose the songs I wanted on my playlists while still having the option to create radio stations like on Pandora. They have a huge variety, so pretty much any song you're looking for, they'll have. The radio stations (created based on artists) tend to play a lot of the same songs over and over. I use the paid version so I don't have to listen to ads when I workout, and I'll continue to do so."
"on January 8, 2017","Can't live without iit!! It has opened up my musical perspectives so much & the Discovery Weekly playlist is so awesomely selected, I fell Spotify knows me!"
"on April 24, 2017","I love it especially if ur on a kindle fire like me bc u have unlimited skips but there are some ads I'm listening to it right know!"
"on November 9, 2017","I love Spotify!"
"on October 5, 2016","Best music app I've tried. Ads are not played often and you Can disable them if you pay."
"on January 9, 2015","I love this app. It's works very well and when I'm bored i just go on this app and listen. There's just one problem. Sometimes when I look at the music that i got it crashes and then I can never get back on app. I keep downloading it over and over and over and over and over again . It gets very frustrating. Is it possible if you can fix that?"
"on February 24, 2015","For being older and not technology savvy, this app is easy to use. The range of genres is excellent. Thanks Spotify!"
"on March 31, 2016","I love this app! It's runs great, and has all the song I'm looking for. The only severe flaw to this app would be that it needs WiFi for everything! You can't listen to any of the music if you don't have WiFi. Besides that great app!!"
"on August 21, 2017","Great app, I'm very happy!"
"on March 24, 2017","This is an amazing app, but every time advertisements play it either restarts or entirely crashes."
"on October 22, 2015","My daughter loves this app."
"on July 2, 2017","This is amazing"
"on May 12, 2017","Would be nice to be able to have some offline tracks for free, but I understand why you can't do that. Works really well on Kindle Fire."
"on February 17, 2015","Love creating my music library with Spotify! There's a fantastic selection to choose from. Would definitely recommend to any music lover."
"on December 27, 2014","I love that I can choose from a wide variety of music.and don't have to be locked in on a certain style"
"on December 28, 2015","My dad listened to spotify all the time, so I tried the free version (i have a fire tablet hd 8 edition 5) and have had no problem at all. You can download a lot of songs and listen to your own playlist, or somebody else's playlist. No more pandora for me."
"on January 26, 2017","Wish I could hold and drag songs/playlists to order/re-order like on the PC version but for my kindle. But that's nothing to lose a star over. Still the best out there."
"on October 26, 2017","Great app, has every kind of music that you like. You can find a lot of great songs that you would not have found before. Also you can listen to old music or new music."
"on August 28, 2017","Love Spotify❤️"
"on February 11, 2016","I don't know what to say. I'm a spotify fiend with a premium membership. I can hear anything I want and any songs that I happen to love, but the weekly discover playlist keeps me coming back because I'm incapable of finding new music on my own."
"on April 9, 2017","This is a very good app,I've used it for about 2 years now, my only issue is how often there's an ad but that won't stop you from singing in the shower!"
"on September 13, 2015","This app has the most variety of music available that I have seen in any app and it is so efficient. The playlists you create can be played offline as long as you have a premium plan which, compared to other music apps, are very affordable. I would reccommend Spotify for everyone."
"on August 15, 2017","My only choice for music listening"
"on July 12, 2017","This app is awesome Lalalala yay yay yay yay yay yay"
"on September 8, 2015","The app is great. Nice design and interface. It's easy to learn and a good service, but I would appreciate the same functionality between tablet and phone. I think it's a bit inconvenient that my phone/phablet doesn't have the same access to songs without shuffle, as a tablet does."
"on August 31, 2015","Spotify is great, and I do have a Premium account for greater mobile listening and no ads. My only complaint is that for unknown playlists (such as one I made) is hard for friends of mine to find unless I send them the playlist. Small complaint, and I definitely love using Spotify."
"on June 5, 2016","Simple and it works."
"on March 28, 2017","Best App for music ever"
"on October 15, 2014","There's a small issue I have a lot of times it will not allow tracks to be played or will say a track is playing, but I only hear silence. That and once it wouldn't let me share to Facebook (facebook specifically.) I haven't tried since. Great quality sound though, and I love the wide open variety. Wouldn't want an app that only has pop, rap and country :p love it"
"on November 27, 2014","I love the fact that this is free and our favorite music I shared spotify with all of my friends but here comes the negative thing tablets don't call out of state with a bid ass screen it should be music anywhere for free no internet. I rest my case ðððððððððððð"
"on March 2, 2016","I find that this app is better than others that I have tried. However it does seem to freeze up from time to time during songs changings I guess nothing is perfect. The download went fine with no hangups. Overall it's a good application."
"on August 26, 2017","I just love spotlight premium I don't have to listen to ads and interrupt my listening they have all the great songs"
"on June 8, 2017","I love all the premade playlists."
"on December 11, 2015","Spotify is my favorite music service. Way better than Pandora and other online radios. The ability to select and listen to any song I want is what puts it over the top! I can even listen to radio stations of my favorite artists if I want to. Thanks Spotify!"
"on March 29, 2017","It has all the music I need. Thank creator's"
"on April 7, 2016","I can listen to whatever I want and like when it comes to my favorites I can listen to them and I just love it and I get to block my teachers out in school while listening to music by Bryson Tiller trapsoul on this app thank you"
"on April 21, 2017","Works very well on my tablet and even plays while I play a game. Spotify premium is even better because there are no commercials and that is the best."
"on February 19, 2016","Has lots of popular songs, however I was disappointed that Taylor Swift wasn't on here. She is my favorite singer, so I wanted to hear her music. Otherwise, good music app. You can create your own public channels and playlists. I recommend"
"on January 18, 2017","A great music channel."
"on May 28, 2017","Love spotify! My go to for listening to music. The mobi!e version is more restrictive but it is still good."
"on June 4, 2017","Its awesomeness i love i can find all the music i really really like!!! I mean all music it a amazing app!!"
"on January 4, 2017","The best third party music player anyone could ask for!!!"
"on December 17, 2014","I love this app, it is pretty great. The only fault i have is that it says i need wifi to listen tothe songs ive downloaded unless i get the upgrade. When i go to get the upgrade there is none. So this makes me mad a lil bc ive already deleted my old music app. But other than that its a great app and i love the way you can organize the music!"
"on October 7, 2017","Have been a Spotify customer for years. Love being able to research and find songs and artists when I want to."
"on December 25, 2016","So far great all the music I love and can download and listen while at work, home, andon the go. I hope it does not change. We will see when I get back from Mexico."
"on August 15, 2016","Oh my ward I can listen to listen to any song I want to when ever I want to with premium BEST APP I HAVE EVER HAD I really thought it was to good to be a mith BUT ITS A TRUE 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄"
"on January 11, 2016","I don't pay but if you choose to, I think it would be worth it...I listen to it if I can't sleep, or if I feel stressed, or just want to listen to music ...Atleast try it, if you don't like it, you can always uninstall.. You have nothing to lose .."
"on April 26, 2017","A few too many interruptions for my taste,. But overall very good."
"on February 25, 2015","I love this music app. It's the best. It has so many choices. There's - browse, many genres to choose from, the radio and the best yet listen to entire albums. It's awesome. Get it. Or at least give it a try. And it's free. There are ads, but, so...not that many. There is the option to upgrade to remove ads and whatever else."
"on October 2, 2016","This app is literally my life I love it so much!! I use this app for all my music and I use it everyday. Even the free version is amazing!! This app is definitely the best for music!!"
"on October 3, 2014","LOVE THIS APP!! YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE SONG YOU WANT TO HEAR YOU DONT HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT PLAY LIKE PANDORA. ALSO YOU CAN REWIND, FAST FORWARD, AND START THE SONG OVER. SIGN UP IS LITERALLY LESS THAN 5 SECONDS. SUPER EASY TO MAKE YOUR PLAYLIST AND SEARCH FOR SONGS (YOU DONT HAVE TO MAKE A PLAYLIST TO LISTEN TO MUSIC THOUGH) LOVE IT, MY NEW FAVORTIE APP !!!!"
"on May 30, 2017","Great app!"
"on May 28, 2017","Best music app ever created in my opinion. Been a loyal subscriber for 5 years."
"on October 22, 2017","I love how it is free, there are minimal commercials, and how have millions of songs and the ability to make and share playlists and music, all at your fingertips."
"on October 1, 2017","Spotify has all the best music for every genre. All the new and all the best music can be found on this app, and you can even download it for off-line use! 11/10!!"
"on November 3, 2017","Love it ! Easy to use , my favorite is to browse new artists."
"on April 6, 2017","Has all the rock, even underground like HU!!!! Nothing is censored"
"on September 20, 2015","Group at ap"
"on January 9, 2016","This app is very useful, I love it! They give you a month or so of free premium. This app even helps youcfind new music! My only issue with this app is after your free premium, you can't listen to music offline without getting premium -Derpy"
"on October 16, 2017","I love this app. I have had it for years and it has been working excellent."
"on April 9, 2017","I love this app so much, and I am a kid my mom puts it on for her salon music it has all of the songs i know and more! GET THIS APP!!"
"on August 25, 2017","Awesome! Love that you can make your own playlists. Would be 5 stars if not for all the ads, but that's what you get with free stuff."
"on July 31, 2017","Very user friendly!!! Also, it has a vast collection of music to choose from."
"on June 7, 2016","This app is the best for listening to music. You can make you're own playlist and for the kindle fire HD there is a glitch that last you skip the songs without Premium. I totally recommend that you download it."
"on February 1, 2017","Is very good and very helpful for studying. I like that it keeps playing your music even if you exit out of the Spotify app. Could add more anime open is tho 🎌🎏"
"on November 28, 2016","I love this app, I really do. But I just have a song request. I would love it if you guys put the song Here Comes The Boom by Nelly. Otherwise GREATEST MUSIC APP EVER."
"on May 25, 2017","Awesome you can make your own 60's and 70's playlists. Great!!!!"
"on March 17, 2017","Great"
"on July 13, 2015","Spotting delivers the best of the best. It uses up to 320 mbps and has almost any song. It has offline mode for premium members and uses sweet quality. For families, each additional premium account is 50% off, same with students. Stop listening to Grooveshark and Pandora and get SPOTIFY! :)"
"on January 16, 2016","Love that I can download directly to my devices , unfortunately you have to pay for the feature, but the $0.99 for 3 months promo is a great deal! I Will gladly pay $9.99 a month afterwards to keep the paid benefits, which there area many of!!"
"on January 16, 2016","Great for listening to a variety of music. You can easily search, and find, just about any song or artist that you like, then Spotify finds similar music for you. Also has a ton of browser options. I like to pick my music by what mood I'm in."
"on September 22, 2016","it's like hitting the lottery, I am able to hear any song I want for the past 60 years, sometimes I want to listen to an old song and Spotify makes this possible, thank you Spotify!!!"
"on September 4, 2014","Sorry for some customers might crazy love Spotify ""CHOICE"", Yes, the Sporify APP is giving ""a list of genre"" followed by human mood. Those list looks fun and catchy, but my mood always change and lazy style of myself is not used to ""TELL"" Spotify company what time is my happy mood, what time is my sad mood. It is let the cat out of the bag!! Meanwhile, since download this app for 1 month, I only hit the play ONCE. Because my listen music style is ""basic"" as Pandora.  Hope my review is not what you looking for, if so, you might have a lot secret mood won't tell! Take care and hope you get the best music app from AMAZON!! Cheeeeeeer for everyday!"
"on July 3, 2017","I love this app sooooo much!!"
"on December 22, 2016","Good for relaxation. As a big music person I would give more stars if I could"
"on November 14, 2016","I absolutely love this app it has everything, songs and story's from all over the world indifferent languages you can even !earn a new language with this am ALTA😍😍😘"
"on July 22, 2015","This is the best music app"
"on August 23, 2016","Awesome app and such a great way to discover new music"
"on May 26, 2016","Way better than Pandora. Offers a lot even without premium. You have way more options with tablets or laptops. It's like having premium but free. Not the same story on a phone though. I highly recommend this app"
"on July 18, 2017","Great app. Love that it connects to FB and has a huge variety of music. Very affordable for the paid app as well. Love Spotify!!"
"on August 24, 2017","Amazing"
"on October 11, 2017","It's the greatest app ever you can make your own playlist and search any song and it is great for on the road if you have a hot spot."
"on March 28, 2017","Tried all music apps. Saving an entire album for free is priceless even with shufflke on."
"on February 2, 2016","Nice app for organizing music but don't like the idea that in order to listen off line need to pay for premium. Disappointing . I won't be paying 10 $ a month. Maybe once and done. Where can I find a free app besides iTunes thats free???"
"on December 14, 2014","I rather enjoy this music app. Is better than any other, in terms of variety. The ability to follow others and listen to their playlists tops the cake for me. I love me music, and listen to different styles depending on my mood. Only issue is that I am so very poor at remembering song artists, song names, etc.........this is a blessing."
"on August 23, 2016","What a great app! But I'm still waiting for Lemonade!"
"on August 23, 2016","its an amaing program, all the músico you can find!!!"
"on June 22, 2017","I am excited to have Spotify and to be able to choose whatever music I am in the mood for! Thank you."
"on May 1, 2017","I love Spotify. The only thing that can get a little annoying is they don't have some songs on there.."
"on June 19, 2015","I love this app, but it sends me 71 EMAILS EVERY DAY! One is 99 ways to listen to music, your favorite music based on your search history. Please only buy this app to listen to music! Don't sign in with your EMAIL unless you have to! I myself prefer RDIO It's a great app to listen to music to."
"on November 10, 2016","I have loved spotify since day one and it continues to get better. I would pick spotify over all the other music apps anytime of the year. 5 star keep being amazing"
"on July 30, 2015","I use my Spotify app for all my music listening, now. Very little ads. Has every song I've ever searched for... including little known indie artists and big name bands. Highly recommend! You can also put this on your Kindle and the music will play in the background as you use it."
"on December 25, 2016","I love this app so much you can get so much free music, it's really crazy. They have such much music. They don't have Taylor swift though, which kind of sucks."
"on May 13, 2016","Spotify often has new albums soon after their release. Also artist radio and topical playlists fit my folky/alternative preferences. Much of the content is available for listening offline with premium. I'm hooked."
"on August 1, 2015","I love everything about this app except for the premium. I bought premium at a great price of 99¢ for 3 months. But when I go to spotify when I'm in the car for example it says no internet connection and won't let me listen to music . So I pretty much bought premium for nothing."
"on September 6, 2017","I love how you can customize your list it not just a ""stations"" it's your music."
"on January 9, 2016","I love spotify. 20 times better than Pandora. You can rewind, fast forward songs. Make lists. Save songs, find SO MUCH NEW MUSIC, pick lists by your mood, or genre...and many many more. So glad I found this app. You will love it. Give it a try"
"on November 9, 2014","I love it. I cant even describe it in words and its free. I lets me repeat the song steal my girl by one direction.. awsome! ""She knows that im never going to let her down"" #Bestappever lalalala its a music lovers heavon and dream. THANK YOU SPOTIFY! Now its time to listen to midnight memories by one direction, bye see ya later guys"
"on September 12, 2016","The music is great! Just be sure to listen to your fav music cuz then you can make a playlist!!! I definitely reccomend this!👍👍👍👌👌👌"
"on August 7, 2014","While listening to opera the music is interrupted by musical commercials for contemporary music. Music sets a mood. The commercials are such a jarring clash of genres that it destroys the mood of the music. These interruptions are truly ill conceived. I doubt popular music listeners would appreciate their music being interrupted by musical commercials for the Met."
"on April 8, 2016","We received Spotify as a gift. Our kids had been recommending it to us for quite a while. Finally they gave us the Premium version. We love it! Listen to your favorites anytime, anywhere! We highly recommend Spotify!"
"on January 15, 2016","For someone like me who has eclectic tastes and listen to music based on moods this is perfect. I was told it as a good music service but I didn't want to try out of stubbornness but now I wish I had it sooner. Get the premium. It's worth it"
"on October 11, 2017","It is very easy to use."
"on October 6, 2015","Yes you can only use shuffle play on a mobile device if you're on the free version that's why I'm always listen to the radio but if you like or don't you have to try it on the computer it's totally different.  I believe Spotify completely earned five stars"
"on March 19, 2016","I love this app so much!!!! I was so happy to know that you get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music then you just have to hear 1 ad that is like 30 seconds then you get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. Best app ever!!!!!!!!!!"
"on May 14, 2017","I would like to see less repeats of songs on stations during the same listening session. And actually removing thumbs down songs."
"on April 14, 2016","I use this on my Kindle fire. I love that I can see is to store my off-line music on my external SD card or on my internal storage. It's a great app and I'm very happy with it. Really enjoying my student pricing as well"
"on May 4, 2017","I enjoy the opportunity to hear the music I like."
"on May 21, 2017","When you do suggestions for a playlist with multiple genres you focus on one genre. Try and suggest songs for all the genres on the playlist :)"
"on November 12, 2015","Its awesome so much better than Pandora! But what would make it even better is if you added when concerts of your favorite bands are playing it would help people so much! And you would get less complaints about the ads! Hope you consider my idea thanks!"
"on January 3, 2017","Best music app there ever was!! Super easy to use and tons of music to choose from. Easy sign up and adding to your playlist is a breeze! Highly recomend😘🎤"
"on June 5, 2016","I love Spotify. I detest being forced to employ Facebook to log in. Myriad attempts, through Spotify, to correct the problem have failed. The software offered to eliminate Facebook adamantly 'thinks' my desire is to change my password, part of the process, but not the goal."
"on May 1, 2015","This app is awesome because I just feel better when I hear music so I love this app"
"on January 6, 2015","The limitations levied on mobile devices intended to manipulate premium purchase are excessive- almost rendering it unusable. But if you're using pc or tablet, spotify basic is great. A competitor is needed to save them from self inflicted alienation of their own consumers, adds and offline mode are incentive enough for premium."
"on November 19, 2016","Very good music app. Works well on my Kindle Fire HDX. Plays the music in the background while I preform other tasks. Nice selection of music and artists available."
"on January 3, 2017","This app is very good I get to listen to my favorite music when I have WiFi. However u need to get spotify premium in order to listen to music without WiFi."
"on September 15, 2017","I use this all the time in fact im listening tho music 🎶🎶🎶🎶right now"
"on February 27, 2015","Love this app. Iv found every song iv looked for with only one artist and one song exception. If I could have found those it would have been 5 stars. It's very user friendly and I love that it let's me get entire albums at one time or pick and choose individual songs. Definitely recommend this app for music lovers."
"on November 3, 2016","It's free. Commercial ever 30 minutes, and they have every stone by EVERY artist. Easy to navigate and create your own playlist too. Wish I found this 2 years ago!!"
"on May 31, 2016","Spotify is worth getting, it does take a while to set up a playlist, but I do have to recommend Pandora to find new artists then deffinetly get spotify so you don't get random songs you don't want to hear."
"on May 1, 2017","It has all the music I like love it"
"on May 3, 2017","Hope you download this app it is so cool and you can listen to all kind of music...💗💖❤👌👌👌👌👌"
"on January 12, 2017","Awesome! I love that I can find the songs I like and save them and listen to them whenever I want to. like Wisin, Brian Mayer, Daddy Yanqui, Sam Smith etc."
"on May 20, 2016","Love this free app, there are tons of new music all the time. Been with spotty for acouple of years and have no complaints with them. If you want no ads there is a fee, but spotfy doesn't hound you about it."

"on September 7, 2016","Best app ever use this app everyday better that Apple music luv you spotify keep doing what your doing I'm listening to spotify while writing this review lol luv u spotify 💗💗💗💗"
"on May 7, 2016","I like being able to pick songs or albums to listen to. Creating my own stations is very important as I listen to it while I am at work. Depending on how your day is going can change what you want to listen to."
"on November 16, 2015","This app is pretty great let's you listen to any music you want. But it also plays songs that arn't on your Playlist but in the same genre. If you get the whole pack thing that you have to pay for monthly then they only play the songs on your playlist."
"on March 26, 2017","Excellent! Glad to have access to all music in one place."
"on February 12, 2015","Really great app, add your own specific music, listen to stations by the the artist or songs like pandora but smarter, and download music from spotify with a premium account. But one feature is that I wish you could pay for premium via amazom store, like a subscription. Other than that, its an awesome app for music."
"on August 13, 2015","Access to pretty much any song imaginable at the drop of a hat with a $9.99 Spotify Premium membership is a great deal in my mind. This replaces all my long lost CD's and for a fraction of the price of buying songs individually. Five stars for the service and the app itself."
"on July 20, 2017","The music streaming service ever!"
"on June 13, 2015","Wide variety of music."
"on February 28, 2016","First my parents got and I was like what's this, oh that's cool then my sis got it she loved it. So you known I decided to try it. IT IS AMAZING. all the music is free and you just add it and go. It's great I RECOMMEND IT!!!!"
"on September 3, 2015","I love spotify for when I am in a specific mood. I can put on my happy playlist when I'm happy, for example, and it sets the environment so perfectly. And it has all the classical music I need for when I'm studying! If I want something specific, Spotify is my go-to app"
"on August 15, 2016","This app has all of the songs you like and that you know"
"on September 4, 2017","I had trouble using the product. I seldom tried to use it, and finally deleted it from my phone."
"on January 17, 2017","Any song to add to a playlist when i want to just hook up to BlueTooth, blast it and drown out life...yeah, i couldnt give up Spotify for anything hardly"
"on January 3, 2017","love everything about my spotify!! its so easy from me to navigate! i never have any problems fining or getting to anything. Love ,Love,live my spotify!!"
"on September 1, 2015","Easy to use, all the songs I want are on there and all kinds of versions. The only thing I don't like is that when I want to test out a song to see if it's the right one it doesn't let me listen to it without downloading it. But it's still a good app. Two thumbs up! :)"
"on January 28, 2015","Spotify is the best download site for those who want a great site for downloading their favourite music. I have been using it to find my most wanted music and even music I haven't heard in years and I haven't been disappointed yet. I would recommend this site to anyone who wants the best music download site out there."
"on May 30, 2017","I love it because you get lots of more music"
"on October 26, 2014","Was very thrilled when I saw that Spotify had been made for a tablet, so I logged in on my Spotify account from my school laptop and saw all my music was there, but now that it has been a few days, it is being very annoying. You can't play music unless in shuffle mode. Unless you are tolerant of nonsense like this, this app is not for you."
"on November 7, 2016","I think this app is amazing. Its free, with only occasional ads, usually giving periods of ad free music. The app is also easy to use, and has many songs to enjoy."
"on May 30, 2017","It gives a playlist of different artists you like and let's you make a playlist of only songs you like.😜👌🏀"
"on February 1, 2017","It's a really good app"
"on June 20, 2017","Just got this, and it had all my favorite music for free unlike Amazon music, i am loving it.😍"
"on January 20, 2016","Works just as well as my iPhone app does. Spotify is an excellent music service at a low cost. Users are able to listen to a seemingly endless collection of music without Ads. It is a fantastic App that I use multiple times daily."
"on January 9, 2017","I love this app it's great im actually using it right as I type it's great and it works even if u shut down the iPad or turn it off u should tots get it"
"on December 25, 2016","I have nothing but praise for this app! I've had it for a year and have been completely happy with it. Awesome selection! Love love love the playlists!!"
"on November 23, 2016","Best ever, great!"
"on October 17, 2017","It's amazing hoomans"
"on August 16, 2017","Love the function ability. Easy to use. Good mix of radio stations"
"on May 3, 2017","Customize your own personal radio. Love it!"
"on January 20, 2016","Easy to use"
"on July 14, 2017","It's amazing I can listen to whatever I want even not on shuffle It is so good at hearing Harry styles and all the 1D songs and 1D people"
"on March 17, 2016","It doesn't give e you 30minutes of add free music I only play one song and then comes an add"
"on June 19, 2016","I practically depend on this app for my daily music needs, I am band trash (think of that what you may because I just went to emøtiønal røad shøw yesterday (June 18, 2016)) so hehe. But this app is absolutely amazing, waay better than apple music which is just a more expensive copy of spotify, spotify is free unless you want premium, but if you don't have premium and you play mudic on shuffle it actually gives good recommendations for songs, for example if you're listening to toxic by britney spears because you like that song or like me are in the phandom or something they won't play like my chemical romance after, they will reccomend like a song similar to toxic. I'm awkward just get the app."
"on July 26, 2016","I use it in other devices and the playlists are great!"
"on July 18, 2017","Great selection I like it a lot"
"on April 10, 2017","It is an excellent way to listen to music and podcasts."
"on August 23, 2016","Awesome app! Love the free version, but wish I could choose the song on my phone like I can on my computer. The ads are pretty few and far between. Pandora seems to have many more."
"on January 23, 2017","This is a great app to have when looking for different music"
"on January 9, 2017","This is literally my favorite app on this entire tablet! It has my fave a cappella group called Pentatonix! Totally 100% worth downloading!#HorseLover!"
"on November 8, 2014","Spotify is arguably one of the best things that ever happened for music listeners and one of the worst for music artists. Artists make next to nothing. We're talking 1/100 of one cent per listen. Do the math and tell me how anyone can live off that. The only artists who can survive are superstars who make all their money from touring."
"on March 27, 2017","excellent music"
"on September 24, 2015","I really like this app. It is very simple and easy to use. I would definitely recommend it to my friends."
"on June 20, 2017","Easy to find music."
"on July 30, 2017","Better than Amazon Prime Music Unlimited. [ Sorry, Amazon :-( ]"
"on August 17, 2017","I absolutely love this and am more than satisfied with the service!"
"on May 4, 2017","Never had so much music at my finger tips."
"on March 11, 2016","I have a 15, 12, and a 8 year old and they all use this app all the time they dont even use there ipod anymore they just download songs using this app, they all listen to the same music so they just share off each other"
"on June 12, 2015","my music my way"
"on September 2, 2014","This app has lots of great music however I'm in a dead zone so if I'm not in my house where I have Wi-Fi I can't listen to it which means running and other outdoor activities are very quiet. It tells me to update to premium so I can use it offline but when I search for the premium I can't find it. How can I update to premium if it's not available?"
"on May 7, 2017","Very useful and love the music because if you get premium than you can listen anywhere anytime"
"on August 31, 2015","Love it"
"on August 31, 2016","Lots and lots of music to put you in whatever mood you to be in, or get out of or got back in time and relive the good old days!!! Music is the message and music is the cure!!!"
"on March 24, 2017","I Love This App So Much Its The Best Music App. My Favorite Song Is ""Don't Wanna Know - Maroon 5"""
"on April 15, 2016","I love it I can listen to my favorite music for free💙💙👍👍👍👍"
"on December 22, 2015","Up the resolution/bitrate and this very good service can be great....I do love the wide selection and find the interface must easier to navigate than Apple`s offering.....always strive to improve the listener experience ....Spotify rocks!"
"on January 9, 2015","Allows you to listen to your music without a hassle"
"on February 25, 2017","Spotify is a very good app you get to find all of your favourite songs and music. You get to make your very own playlists even I rate this app 5stars."
"on March 13, 2017","Coolest app of all time for shure Great selection,you can make your own playlist. Defenently recommend it to anyone."
"on September 10, 2015","I love spotify but I really don't like the new update. I can't choose my own songs anymore. I have to shuffle and go in what it wants. Also playing songs not on my playlist. I liked it so much better before the new update. It would be a five if it didn't update..."
"on December 14, 2015","Apple is catching up to Spotify, but I'm sticking with this music service. Great music and one way to keep the industry from imploding. For me, Spotify seems to have slightly better transmission clarity and a more user-friendly interface."
"on April 14, 2015","Who doesn't love spotify?"
"on August 6, 2015","Thank you!!!! Nothing can replace Napster...well, except for Spotify. I tried the free version; I didn't love the commercial, especially while I was at work (they were condom commercials) Awkward!!! :) So I signed up for the premium version and I tell everyone about it."
"on February 14, 2015","I listen in the morning and afternoon at work. Great selection and I enjoy it better than the other like services. You can skip as often as you like and don't need to give a song a thumbs up or down. I enjoy the different selection and the updates so I'm not hearing the same songs over and over. It's worth it."
"on October 10, 2014","Totally recommend this app. If you Love music apps....you have to have this!!!!"
"on June 5, 2017","Love it"
"on June 9, 2017","This app is my ""Go to"" for music, so happy!"
"on January 14, 2016","This app is Awesome some because I lets you put your own music up here that you actually like to listen which is very cool to me...so yeah I really recommend you to get this app it really works very well and it also doesn't freeze like other apps"
"on February 26, 2016","Love it! I was dedicated to Pandora and now i cant go a day without opening my Spotify app. I tried Apple Music but I already have dozens of playlists and theyre much easier to create, add, and edit than with Apple Music."
"on June 12, 2017","Awesome app! Great for when your bored ! I'm in love with the app!!!💖💟💖💟💖💟💖 I recommend that you get this app!!!!"
"on June 14, 2015","Was nice but I went back to Pandora"
"on April 24, 2016","It's really good for my wide range of music tastes, easy to use, it also allows me to pick the song that I wish to listen to rather than just hope it plays on Pandora, and (in my experience) very little ads."
"on September 18, 2015","Ok well I love how it's free but it won't let me pick my song now I thing it's the update...and it's really annoying.like it will only let me do shuffle..."
"on May 23, 2017","Easy app to find all your favorite songs"
"on August 12, 2015","Spotify is a great app for anybody who likes music. It's got a massive selection of genres and artists for all tastes, and it's all free if you don't mind listening to a couple minutes of advertising every now and then. I've got the app on both my iPad and Kindle Fire."
"on September 13, 2015","Just when I thought I couldn't love Spotify any more, they come out with the brilliance of Connect. Now I can be in my backyard any day of the week, controlling my Desktop playlist through the speakers in my backyard via my phone. Genius. Couldn't love it more."
"on May 15, 2017","Great App. Highly Recommend!!"
"on June 11, 2017","Hvbbnn"
"on November 29, 2015","Spotify is my absolute favourite app, it is just perfect. I believe that there may be a little bit too many commercials but it makes up for it in letting everyone free music to listen to. Overall an amazing app, would recommend it to anyone."
"on September 16, 2015","While I love the music. Making a payment is a nightmare. Once again I am unable to access the system to enter my information. Last time this ended up in double billing for approx. 9 months. So frustrated. No way to contact the &#34;Spotify people&#34;"
"on September 21, 2017","I enjoy being able to pick an artist, and listen to his music. Or I can choose a stars station and listen to the variety of artists on that station."
"on September 20, 2014","I 'M VERY HAPPY YOU MADE A WONDERFUL APP SPOTIFY MUSIC, (ARTIST OF MUSIC TO ME). I WAS VERY IMPRESSED THAT EVERY ARTIST I REMEMBER YOU HAVE. IT'S ALRIGHT YOU HAVE 1TO 2 ADS SINCE YOU DON'T CLIP THE MUSIC. YOU CAN HEAR A LOT SONGS OF SAME ARTIST AT ONCE OR SHUFFLE THE ARTIST OR MUSIC. I HOPE THIS APP NEVER CHANGES HOW GOOD IT IS!!!!!!!!!"
"on December 7, 2016","Love all music for each and every thing you do during the morning, on your way to work, driving home from work, at night, late night, working out, etc."
"on March 12, 2017","TOTALLY WORTH IT! 5 STARS 4 SURE! I 💗 THIS APP! U SHOULD GET IT! *****"
"on February 22, 2015","Spotify has it all! Do you feel like memory lane, your favorite songs are there for you. Feel like dancing you can make party with your downloads. Got blues well this app has that too. I've been listening for hours on end everyday since getting this app. If you love music, all music you have to get this app."
"on March 3, 2017","TABEL"

"on December 16, 2016","Absolutley love spotify. Some songs arent on here but for the most part they are! Great radio stations to, love it better than pandora cuz no adds!!"
"on December 12, 2016","What's not to like? Find old favourites, scope out something new and be surprised by something different. It's just a brilliant way to explore music!"
"on May 11, 2017","Very good app! I like that I can use my kindle to control the spotify app on the PS4 so I can play music on my stereo."
"on June 9, 2017","Free and amazing cause you can download music and then you don't need Wi-Fi to play music."
"on September 26, 2015","I can't seem to listen to the songs or play them at will. On top of that you are forced to hear commercial s . You can't listen to the song you want to listen to immediately, you have to wait for it to go through a shuffle and wait for your song. Not happy"
"on July 11, 2016","amazing I use it almost everyday wide variety of songs"
"on July 2, 2016","Has all of the new and hot songs, only con is it doesn't have some older songs. And you have to get premium for it to be good. Otherwise great. You can make your own playlist. Recommended."
"on June 1, 2015","I love this app. I'm addicted to music and spotify is the best pusherman so far. As a musician I'm not so sure yet. Not everything is on here. And some stuff gets taken off sometimes for whatever reason. But out of all the music download/stream apps out there this is BY FAR THE BEST."
"on July 19, 2017","I don't think there is a better music streaming service out there. Love the integration with Sonos. Good integration with Alexa too."
"on June 15, 2017","I love Spotify the only thing I don't like is the commercials but who likes commercials when all you are trying to do is jam out!?!?"
"on November 11, 2016","I love that Spotify has all kinds of music. I can choose between music for me and my husband and my kids. It's all current music and some forgotten goodies."
"on September 4, 2015","Excellent Music App! All 4 of us in my family use it everyday on mobile devices, iMac, pcs at home and office. What a quality app!!!  I introduced Spotify to many of my friends. All appreciate it so much!  Thank you very much, Spotify Team!"
"on December 27, 2014","LOVE this app! It's awesome. You can listen to entire albums for diverse artists, genres, eras, and take a trip down memory lane, or get caught up on some new artists. Or you can create your own playlists with whatever theme you choose. Unlike other apps, you can choose what artists, and what songs, you want on your lists."
"on August 1, 2016","I really enjoy being able to listen to any song I want anytime and if you don't have premium, the advertisements aren't that consistent ( as in not every song), really great app."
"on November 7, 2015","Spotify is by far one of the best music apps out there. I haven't had any issues with the functionality, and the library is extensive. I am finding all the music I had with Google play plus some. Would certainly recommend giving this one a try."
"on July 7, 2016","Absolutely fantastic!! I can listen to anything I like including tracks from my youth that I thought I would never hear again. It has also widened my music interests. Highly recommended."
"on May 30, 2016","Absolutely epic!!! I've found songs I haven't heard since I was a kid! And it's pretty easy to navigate around too. And I can play it on all my devices, not just my home PC. Spotify is awesome!"
"on June 15, 2016","I love that you can choose a specific artist and listen to their music specifically rather than music similar to that artist. Also, Iove that you can choose songs that you want to listen too."
"on June 27, 2015","I really love this app. It's so easy to find the songs that you want. One thing I dislike is that you need internet to listen to the music. Some of us want to listen without wi-fi but Spotify doesn't let you. I wouldn't recommend if you are going on a camping trip or something."
"on June 23, 2017","I have only been using Spotify for sure. But I found it it's easy to use and has many of the songs from the genre that I listen to"
"on September 1, 2016","I love Spotify. They have some great playlists, convenient noise while I work to party playlists and road trip mixes. Not to mention the fact that you can make your own. :)"
"on May 21, 2016","Spotify Is my #1 music app, I would highly recommend this app to anyone, but the ads still bothers me. so, I can just get a gift card and get premium for I can choose any song without interruptions"
"on June 19, 2017","It's very njce and relaxing, helps with mood Swings also!"
"on March 23, 2017","Glad I can listen to music without paying (yet) for the album."

"on September 27, 2017","Love it.. even if I do have to pay$$$"
"on September 22, 2016","I like this music app because it gives me a greater variety of what to listen to and on premium I don't even need Internet connection to play all my favorite Playlists"
"on September 3, 2016","I love it!!! I use music to communicate and stay in touch with emotions, the selections on Spotify are great"
"on December 10, 2015","It's a very easy app to use, and I like the fact that it has a Discover section. I found most of the bands I love through this! It has a great variety of songs for every genre, and you can make playlists to categorize all of your songs."
"on March 11, 2015","Well I love Spotify, and even though I had it before prime, I still recommend it to anyone. I am currently paying for both separately though, because I am afraid I'll lose my stuff if I decide to use it through my amazon prime account. I don't want to lose all my playlists, or risk taking that chance."
"on June 23, 2015",":)"
"on July 27, 2017","Very good I approve of it"
"on August 10, 2017","It has some choices. Just not enough. Needs more."
"on October 13, 2015","I love this app gives you all the music you want and the ability to download onto your phone. It is a little pricey at 10 per month, my Netflix is less! but it has the newest music and the ability to download onto phone and use while you are offline."
"on June 29, 2016","Latest update is no longer available in Malaysia. Spotify is available in Malaysia, I have a premium subscription with them through my telco, and I can get the latest versions on my other Android and iOS tablets. However on my Blackberry Passport and LeapFrog Epic who can only get apps from the Amazon AppStore, Amazon is denying me the ability to download the update. Very disappointed. I've already contacted Amazon Customer Service and they told me to contact Spotify, who is appearing to be clueless as to what has happened.  I'd have given it 5 stars, but denying me off the update, even for something I'm paying monthly for, is just plain wrong."
"on January 15, 2017","I really like it. I can type in any old song from the past, and there it is. If you are looking for music that you like, here is the place. Bobby"
"on January 16, 2017","Such a great music player. The customized playlists by users is awesome because they get updated. I especially love my weekly discover playlist."
"on January 24, 2017","I love Spotify, I have it downloaded on multiple devises so I can always have it right by me. Great for those who love always listening to music."
"on September 15, 2016","This is an awesome app just one problem..... it doesn't let me get off of shuffle!!!!!!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix this bug soon. Otherwise I would have gave it 5 stars"
"on January 14, 2016","It's a great app and has a variety of music, the only reason I didn't rate it five stars is because about every three songs an add comes on asking you to get spotify premium, it sometimes even says it in the middle of the song!"
"on May 6, 2017","Very cool, easy, reliable. Just wish I could download without spending cash I don't have"
"on June 10, 2017","It was extremely easy to set up my library. Every song I wanted was instantly available."
"on November 7, 2016","This is the best! I love it. It works great on everything I have. I use it on a kindle fire, iPhone, iPad, amazon echo, amazon dot, and iPod! It is amazing"
"on March 8, 2015","I am soooo happy I didn't pay for Pandora upgrade. Because spotify is the FREAKING BEST.. took me a while to get used to and I had to keep clicking on things to get adjusted.. but it's just amazing... wish it was a easier way to download and add the music to your music.. but maybe it's just me lol.."
"on January 8, 2015","I love the app, but there's only one thing I find faulty with it. On my old kindle, it was amazing, but I recently got a new one and I immediately downloaded this app. But, when I downloaded it, I only got a limited amount of skips like I was on Pandora, and I can't choose to play a specific song. It bums me out."
"on November 1, 2017","love Spotify, sound quality is awesome and song selection too"
"on June 25, 2017","This is the best music station ever."
"on June 1, 2016","One day at work a colleague told me why I was still using my old iPod (the wheel design) and she told me to use spotify, and I was like ""spot...what"". I'm a premium user now, love it!"
"on August 21, 2017","Ok"
"on March 16, 2017","Wish there was free offline music, but very good formatting and easy to use"
"on July 11, 2015","I'm s huge music fan and have spent thousands over the years on downloads and CDS. Although I'm now probably not doing the industry any favours, I love the vast access to new and old music, and for work it's excellent as we can often tire of the same music pretty quickly!"
"on January 4, 2017","New user to spotify found it easy to log into and start listening to gr8 music and looking forward to finding out more gr8 stuff as time passes."
"on December 17, 2016","This app is the easiest music app I've used, I think I'll keep it.🙆"
"on July 5, 2016","It was perfect! It has all the songs and bands I could ever want and more! I wouldn't have known some of my favorite songs if it wasn't for the customized playlist it suggests for you."
"on August 28, 2016","Let's make a rule so u won't be abused cause ur name might sounds that u are light but u carry lots of weight that can make lots of sad and crying people in different mood"
"on May 24, 2015","I really don't like spotify that much. One thing that drives me crazy is not being able to sort or filter my saved music or music on an artist's page in any useful way. I really liked the way I could sort, filter, and queue music in Grooveshark, but Grooveshark is dead, so here I am."
"on September 21, 2016","Best music app out there. You can play what you want when you want. Whatever mood you're in you can form a playlist to fit that mood. Premium is definitely worth it!"
"on July 23, 2017","I love it I use it alot"
"on August 4, 2017","I like that it keeps your songs readily available and that you can listen to your friends music too."

"on August 16, 2016","I love this app I just don't like all of the advertisments but this app has almost all of the songs and most of the newest mix tapes I tell all of !y friends about this app."
"on August 7, 2017","Great music"
"on April 8, 2017","Great app to find great music airing now and treasures from the past. 😀"
"on November 16, 2014","Free music on my Kindle... how could I NOT like it? Just wish I could get free music on my ipod shuffle, since that's what I use to keep me motivated when doing chores or exercising at the gym. I even found a country song from the 80s I'd been wanting to hear for a long time, so this app doesn't just have ""new music""."
"on October 12, 2015","This app was hella stellar //on tablets and computers// but idk what happened but now you have limited skips, only can shuffle, etc. Like on mobile.which it didn't used to be like that....Spotify what's good??  Other than that its decent"
"on September 23, 2017","Guards are a rad small otherwise great product"
"on January 26, 2016","Great app !! So glad Kindle has this. Would recommend everybody to download and use it. User friendly, easy to navigate through. So far not disappointed !!! Thanks for bringing this great music app to Kindle users !! 😃👏"
"on January 17, 2017","The student discount for premium is great! I've never had any trouble with this music service and I'm also discovering new music all the time."
"on May 4, 2017","This app works with androids and Amazon tablet's , there is a variety of music artists on this app."
"on February 12, 2016","Great music. They should let it be free, and keep all songs saved on phone, tablet,kindle etc."
"on September 19, 2016","App works fine. Not a fan of the service, but this review isn't about people being happy with how spotify works it's is the app functional and as described. It is."

"on June 21, 2017","I prefer to use this app than others! This is much better then my previous music app."
"on December 29, 2014","Amazing. I have been using Spotify since 2012 and have never had any issues. The app is reliable, convenient, and allows flexibility. I have broadened my taste in music and pursued an interest in playing the guitar simply through finding more and more artists that appeal. Kills Pandora or any other radio program"
"on March 1, 2017","I have had Spotify since it came out and I specifically enjoy the student discount that I get!"

"on October 5, 2015","You will have a good time with Spotify. You CAN use it, fee free, however Premium is the best. Whatever else you are paying for, each month, make room for this service. All the music you want, when you want it with no library to worry over. Cheers!"
"on October 12, 2017","No wait. No pausing. So much music."
"on September 8, 2017","This is Awesome! I can get to my favorite songs instantly!"
"on March 1, 2015","However Pandora is just as good."
"on February 3, 2016","I would rate it with five stars, but I tried to listen to my music so I put it on and it wouldn't play a song. Instead it continued to skip a song and occasionally play until the middle of the song but then skip again."
"on September 17, 2014","Easy to use and wide variety of music.Thanks!"
"on October 29, 2016","Spotify is cool because you can switch between a tablet o a pc to a phone and vice versa without losing your place in a song. That's only one of the many features that makes it awesome."
"on November 16, 2016","Have not used it a lot so far, but really like having the music on my tablet when I have time to listen.......I recommend for everyone should try it!"
"on May 15, 2017","In order to use it ypou need WiFi but you can choose any song other than need WiFi i love this app💖💖💖💖💖💖💖"
"on August 23, 2016","Just started using it. O.K. so far"
"on May 5, 2017","I'm really impressed with this music app. Only problem I've come across is that i couldn't find Lil Wayne's no ceilings album."
"on March 17, 2017","This is so awesome you don't get anything for free. I find the caliber of music choices to be unbelievable. Thanks for being out there for our listening pleasure."
"on May 3, 2017","Good app."
"on December 30, 2016","Can't Live without Spotify. This App is a true God send for all music Lovers. Sing A Song Everyday. And Enjoy all those magical sounds."
"on February 5, 2017","Love it. The only app that I use the paid version of. Got it for the whole family and everyone loves it. I recommend it to all music lovers."
"on October 5, 2015","Aesthetic app out there. It has all type of music to fit your liking. I'm telling you this app is great and it's also free. It's so good that I bought the premium for only 99 cents so I can listen to all my music with out the assistance of Wi-Fi."
"on October 18, 2015","I would give it 5 stars but I used the free play load to see if buying the downloads wold be a good thing to buy so I did and now I want to buy it but I can't because it said I bought it but I haven't and I would be happy if u fixed it thank u"
"on December 29, 2015","I have would rate this infinity stars If I could but there is only one problem it needs to be connected to WiFi and if u want WiFi u have to pay for premium but the rest of it is amazing !!it has lots of songs and easy to use"
"on October 15, 2016","I will never, EVER regret this trial download nor purchase! Cuz it's worth it, every little penny! They tell you to invest wisely. Well, here you go!!"
"on February 19, 2016","Spotify is amazing. It's our go-to app for playing music in our home. I don't even mind the occasional ads! And I love being able to access play lists that other people have made. What a great way to share music!"
"on June 4, 2016","This app pretty good to bad it doesn't some underground music and Japanese rock music. I haven't run into any problem of finding music or commercials, that's if you pay your subscription."
"on March 26, 2016","I been using this app for a year now, with in the resent update they added a broken add system that every 5 or so minutes it turns on saying I got 30 minutes of free music but in reality its like 2 songs"
"on May 26, 2017","Great app for music lovers. Tons of music, from the old and esoteric to the contemporary, singles to full albums."
"on June 11, 2017","I love Spotify. I could not live without it now."
"on June 29, 2016","Spotify is the source for rare, discontinued gems."
"on September 22, 2016","Spotify is great! There are few songs I cannot find and a wide selection of music. I've listened to music I never would have thought I liked, thanks to Spotify."
"on November 15, 2016","This is very entertaining and really help me make it through everyday in my work or travels. Wide variety of music and playlist and got all I want."
"on July 19, 2016","This allows me to listen to my favorite music easily, wish I could get premium"
"on July 9, 2015","It's more than just the choices of music which is outstanding. It is also the equalizer, the browsing tools and other niceties that make it a pleasure. The ability to make your own playlists and share them is also a big facet of why I enjoy it. Truly a great service"
"on April 5, 2015","A must for music lovers. Thousands of songs and artists at your disposal. I pay the $9.99 per month fee, which allows me to preview and download full albums and playlists. This saves me so much money on buying albums, songs, etc. that I  may not enjoy so much. Yay for Spotify!e"
"on September 22, 2017","love it"
"on February 4, 2017","Spotify, isn't too bad. I like it however I don't think you should have to buy premium for some of the features. Other wise excellent app."
"on December 31, 2014","Quite simply the best music software available anywhere. I love it and will pay for a subscription indefinitely."
"on January 20, 2016","I love it so much! I loved Pandora but it had a skip limit. So my friend told me about it and she said no skip limit! So I switched but I still like Pandora! And you can listen to songs from your favorite movies!!!! 😁"
"on October 24, 2014","I love this app it's really easy to use an d it has about all the songs ever. I've always wanted music on my phone and the best part about it is is that you can play games while listening to music plus now you c an have a playlist list all your favorite song! There are to buts or ifs thanks for the wonderful app- ! :D"
"on May 20, 2017","Have used this app religiously since 2013. Very user friendly. Constantly evolving. Good stuff."
"on April 16, 2015","I love Spotify!! I previously had IHeart and Pandora installed on my phone and tablet, respectively, but quickly removed them after installing Spotify. With Spotify, you can actually listen to entire albums if you wish and customize/re-create them to your liking. I highly recommend!"
"on August 24, 2016","The best music player available."
"on October 22, 2014","This is a great app so far. I am able to find all the artists and music that I am interested in easily and quickly. The sound is great and I can't believe that all this is from a free app. The few ads that broadcast periodically are worth enduring for the quality of this service.........and, IT'S FREE!! Way to go Spotify!"
"on February 8, 2016","This is the place for your music. Download the songs you want. Listen anyplace, anytime only limit is your device storage. Best music player I have found. I really like spotting. Thanks for a very nice product."
"on May 13, 2016","Amazing you can make playlist and play them over and over again"
"on October 29, 2015","Greatest music app on the planet! I started off as a free user and loved Spotify even then. . . however, I have to admit that I am now a Spotify Premium user (student) and love it even more. The app works great, the Discover Weekly playlists are usually awesome and I don't regret paying for it at all. What I like about it, is that I download almost any song that I want to my devices, and then listen to it anywhere until I get play it to death and find a new favorite song. I would recommend this app to pretty much anyone, but if you're like like me you might get hooked and not be able to get away.  *One important note: Spotify usually has clean radio edits of pretty much all songs but right now it doesn't have a general filter/ setting that you can use to filter. If you are offended by profanity or worried about objectionable content (and don't want to monitor it closely) that might pose a problem because beside looking at each individual song I don't know a workaround."
"on February 28, 2017","I love this app I don't even have premium and I luv it"
"on July 17, 2014","What I don't understand about this app is why I can't get the premium. It's very stressful when I'm trying to find the premium and the kindle Appstore keeps telling me it doesn't exist. Every time I want to skip a song after I ran out of skips it pops up a reminder to get the premium. But how can do that when the Appstore says it doesn't exist?"
"on August 12, 2017","I love that I can listen to the music I like anywhere with this app"
"on January 11, 2017","I use Spotify almost everyday and love it! I would like to see a wider variety but for the most part all of the songs I love are on here."
"on October 6, 2014","I am enjoying this service so much. Only a few songs I've looked for that they don't have but 9x out of 10 they've got it. One thing I wish is that there was a way to make a song offline without it having to redownload. At some point the music space maxes out and then I have to undownload it. But other than that I'm very satisfied."
"on July 10, 2017","They don't have Beyoncé's Lemonade album."
"on July 18, 2017","It's really good."
"on September 11, 2015","I had Spotify for a long time, not Premium, but I always liked it, now that it was updated you can't listen to the exact song that you want, it's stuck on shuffle permanently unless you pay to get Premium. Which is a terrible idea, come on Spotify."
"on April 18, 2016","With over 20 million tracks, Spotify is the most likely to have the the music you want to stream at home. This app has an attractive and easy to use visual layout and menus for your Amazon Device."
"on December 2, 2016","It has about every track I've ever wanted ... plus it's free! And it streams purrrfectly & your own playlists are easy. What's not to LOVE!!!"
"on December 2, 2016","spotify it's best thing that has happened since I was a little snotty nose kid listening to MTV lol. And love the echo dot from amazon alexa."
"on December 2, 2016","Excellent Excellent . From listening on my phone to through my hifi via spotify connect this the my favourite app. Nothing else to say really"
"on May 12, 2017","This is the best station I use! I never use anything else!!!! It's got great quality audio, and I use it all the time!!!!"
"on March 14, 2017","Music is very important to me. I don't like interruptions and I have access to almost everything I want, including Prince."
"on July 20, 2016","Best. Music. App. Ever! I really like how playlists can be available offline so that I can play my music from there through my bluetooth stereo in my car without using data."
"on May 13, 2017","Easy to use.... Great music!"
"on January 12, 2017","I love music and have a very long eclectic playlist. Spotify has pretty much everything I want and I discover new awesomeness everyday."
"on December 21, 2014","Great way to listen to listen to music without having to pay any thing. I wish it had a sleep timer like Pandora. If I wasn't already paying for Pandora, I would probably pay for this and get it commercial free. But the commercials are not long or frequent. And paying gives you the option to listen offline."
"on August 29, 2017","I really enjoy the variety of music !ists and all chosen with my taste in music"
"on August 23, 2016","This is like so super cool bro"
"on May 2, 2017","This is one of the best music apps you could ask for. I also like being able to follow and listen to my friends playlist."
"on June 8, 2017","I think this app is very good because you can find any song you want and it good for party or even for really long trip."
"on November 1, 2014","The only thing that is not the best is 30 second ads but things like Pandora do that.Other than that it's great you can make playlists and share them to everyone and follow your favorite artists and listen to their songs. I totally recommend getting it over so many other things. Hope you enjoy it just as much as I do!"
"on July 23, 2016","Very much better than my previous music app I was using, which was iheart radio. I like how it doesn't do ads as often as iheart, and how you can play whole albums at once"
"on June 17, 2017","Awesome source for music!!!"
"on August 5, 2014","This one you can choose your favorite songs and you can save them and they are different varieties to pick and different genres. Just don't log out of this app you can press the home button and it still saves but don't press.the log out button or all your songs will delete and you will have to start all over on your fav list of songs. :)"
"on January 2, 2017","I love the music but one thing I was not happy with is that you must have a premium account in order for Spotify to work through Alexa."
"on July 23, 2015","Im not sure why this is showing up on my Amazon list, but since it did I must say that this is the most powerful innovation of the last decade.  I dont know what I would do without it. Well I guess now I could get the Apple clone...Way to go Sweden!"
"on June 15, 2017","I love this app because you don't have to get premium just to listen to your favorite songs!"
"on May 5, 2017","I enjoy all the free up-to-date music the commercials don't bother me I love it great app!!!"
"on May 20, 2017","Great selection of all genres of music."
"on December 21, 2015","I LOVE this app so much! Has so many songs and this app keeps me hip into music!!!!!!! Which is helpful to keep my reputation in school!!!! 😄😄 haha ew jk. If u don't have this app, tap that download button right now!!!!!"
"on August 28, 2016","It's pretty good. If you like skrillex you can listen to his music If you like imagine dragons you can listen to them Pretty much anyone🎼🎻🎺🎹🎸🎷🎶🎵"
"on October 25, 2014","I love this app! Free music and almost any song that you can think of, I mean, who couldn't love it? But there is a reason why I can't give it four stars. You can't change the song. You need a payed membership to pick certain songs and skip them, otherwise it's just placed on shuffle. Other than that though, I love it!"
"on March 19, 2015","I think this app is amazing. It was a little confusing at first but with their guide I was able to figure it out. They have a very big collection of all types of music. I really wish that I didn't have to have internet but it is still a very good app. This app very much suits the kindle."
"on July 17, 2015","Best music player ever!!!! I got it because i wanted to listen to music that was different from mine and i loved it. I could pick almost any song that has ever been made and add it to a playlist and shuffle it. Spotify is an awesome app, highly recommend it!!!"
"on May 3, 2016","I love being able to listen to all different types of music whenever I want to and to find music to fit every mood. Spotify allows me to do that and for that reason, I give Spotify 5 stars."
"on January 10, 2015","Spotify is awesome! From music to comedy, they have pretty much everything you could desire to listen to. You can also add your own music to the player to listen to as well. Unlike Pandora, the music is on-demand so if you want to listen to en exact song or album you can. Well worth the $9.99 a month!"
"on June 7, 2017","This app seems amazing. However, I wonder whether artists are compensated properly. Ads are really not very intrusive. But why is there not under Amazon apps the opportunity to pay the .99 cents as a form of upgrade like with some other apps. In addition I have wondered why Amazon has changed things with regards to music. Now if I go straight to Music - Store, all I get is Prime listening stuff. I do not want to pay $10.00 a month just for listening to some music. I do like to buy tracks or CDs if I like them. I discovered one can go straight to ""shop"" and then one still has the ability to sample the tracks, or put a CD or track on your Carousel and then when they suggest other music you still can sample some tracks. I used to love the radio app Tune-In but they also changed things and truly I wonder why. Now I no longer like that one. If something is good, please leave it alone."
"on May 2, 2017","Yay"
"on May 14, 2017","it don't work on my Kindle"
"on July 9, 2017","LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!!!"
"on March 13, 2017","Nice app, very convenient."
"on January 4, 2017","I used to listen to Pandora. I LOVE Spotify because I can listen to my favorite songs or the complete album. Dolores Zapata Murff"
"on April 5, 2017","Amazing app, really Iove it, can always count on the quality and how much entertainment is offered through the different categories"
"on January 9, 2017","I love it! So many options for listening; song mixes, full albums, artist, song, and genre based radio. You can downoad and alot more"
"on January 18, 2017","I love the fact that you can pick your own songs, not the whole album and play them in any order you want, or put them in a playlist."
"on January 9, 2017","The only downfall is paying premium for a few extra features, but other than that, it's awesome! Especially for Kindle Fire users. ;)"
"on January 19, 2017","Easy to use, premium service is worth it to have that much music at your hands. Having the podcasts and videos are excellent bonuses."
"on May 22, 2017","This I've had it paid for (which is truly worth it) and it's amazing even if you don't pay"
"on June 13, 2017","It's very great, you can listen to music while playing or on another app and you have your own playlist."
"on February 28, 2015","A bit redundant at first, then it picks up and appears to provide more variety than its competitor Pand. It also provides more opportunities at ad-free listening than P. I have yet to upgrade to their premium service but I think it's a definite improvement over my previous go-to music app."
"on April 30, 2016","I URGE You to find your fav music in the first 30 days. I was in hospital and missed out on a lot. It works well but you get similar music, not the exact person you were looking for most times."
"on April 19, 2016","It has a cool layout and a lot of variety on the Browse. I like it a lot better than Pandora, which feels primitive and boring to me. Spotify has a lot more music that is new and interesting."
"on March 11, 2017","Spotify is a great app for trips and even gaming!"
"on February 13, 2017","Great experience with the spotify app the music plays crisp and smooth plus you get to checkout other playlist and remixes of music."
"on February 22, 2017","For a person who can never keep track of all the songs I love, this is the perfect app. Especially on the PS4 version. LOVE IT!"
"on August 6, 2017","Very nice. I like using."
"on February 4, 2016","Great choices for music genres, radio, and new music. Not interrupted too much for announcements, etc. I use Spotify Music more often because of the variety of music and search for music I want to look for."
"on February 4, 2015","Play all your music from their library...have only come across two bands that didn't have everything I wanted....more music that's on my terabyte drive...coming from a forty year old that loves all genres...play on tablet or phone while...playing games surfing web at the same time....awesome"
"on May 19, 2017","This is the best, and well worth it, songs from my past never heard before, can't say enough"
"on January 2, 2017","Like I said ,this is awesome! It has a great selection of songs. And I bet you will find some new favorites to. I definitely recommend getting this if you love music! 😃"
"on March 4, 2017","Spotify , is perfect !! I love how they post all the real songs , with options of different artists singing them , to where you can try something new ."
"on August 7, 2017","Great you can get any genre you want"
"on August 27, 2016","I like it. I wish it was cheaper though. I can't afford it every month. I also wish it was just a bit easier to sort songs and albums. But all in all it's pretty good."
"on July 1, 2017","I love spotify. All you need is an email and password! And you can create your own playlists, and follow your favorite artists! It's the best!👌👌👌"
"on September 7, 2015","Easy to use,very few repeat songs on playlists to playlists. Some great songs that I forgot were out there and are not on other sites. By not perfect. Searching playlists for that next song can take a while. And genres can be a little confused."
"on May 24, 2017","I am impressed how easy it is to add unlimited music to my account and how each choice opens up to endless choucesy!!"
"on March 2, 2016","I have had this for awhile and I love it so much it's a lot better than other music apps I've had in the past, I love making my own playlist n discovering new music and being able to listen off line :)"
"on December 17, 2014","It's dependable and has a very wide variety of music. Ads get annoying sometimes but it's worth it in the end."
"on October 4, 2015","Spotlight improves my life in so many ways. I love finding new music by artists I know and new artists. Meditations balance me. Spiritual music, rock, folk, dance, audio self help... - Spotify has the best of everything."
"on August 2, 2014","I love spotify because you can choose songs when you get the upgrade!!!!!! It's way better then Pandora. I love spotify!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"on December 28, 2014","The best music app for me. I can listen any song I want."
"on March 15, 2015","The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos The best for musiphilos"
"on July 1, 2015","Great app I have too admit,  but the stupid ads get so annoying especially when in the middle of your song."
"on February 10, 2015","Easy way to listen!!"
"on July 7, 2016","The best music app ever but if you're on android and iOS there is no unlimited skips or u can't any song it a shuffle. But u have to premium which so annoying and the ads"
"on November 3, 2015","I used to love this app but got locked out of my account. I created a new one but it was DIFFERENT. I had to shuffle a bunch of different songs in order to get to the one I want! Not only that but I can't skip tracks. Please fix"
"on July 2, 2016","I love this app but it won't work offline"
"on December 12, 2016","Only complaint is that you can't save a group to your Playlist. You can only save individual songs. However, that is cool in itself."
"on August 3, 2014","This app is amazing! Absolutely love it! It is a quick load, there is no static-y sounds, and it is just so much better than having to buy the songs on ITunes. No words can describe how much I love this! No words!"
"on August 26, 2014","I think Spotify Music is a great app and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants their own custom playlist but doesn't want to pay for the music. Spotify has all the songs I love and I really enjoy having this app, it's similar to Pandora, but with Spotify the music playing is all you're choice. I hope that my review was helpful, thank you!"
"on January 2, 2017","Fabulous. I'm using Spotify smooth playing, seldom a glitch Spotify on three devices: Laptop, LG Power cellphone, Amazon Fire HD8."
"on January 17, 2017","Doesn't have EVERY song, but I'm happy that I can create a playlist and it's easy for my friends to check them out. Plus...FREE :)"
"on July 28, 2017","Love the easy search and creation of playlists."
"on November 29, 2014","My go-to music service. It's much better than any other service like Rdio, Slacker or Play Music."
"on May 2, 2017","Love this app. Makes listing to music much better. Love this"
"on July 14, 2017","Please cancel my subscription sorry but does not work for me"
"on August 8, 2017","Love music streaming!!"
"on June 6, 2017","It's perfect , like it"
"on May 26, 2015","This is a free app, so it's hard to complain too much. I downloaded it for my Kindle Fire HD. It loads quickly and has all the features you need for Spotify on a tablet. Unfortunately, there are a few playback issues. Three main examples:  1. Songs often skip or have annoying pops. 2. When using the shuffle feature for an artist, the app seems to play the same few songs over and over (and mostly from the artist's most recent albums). 3. The app often stops playing music when using another program on the Kindle. For example, if I am browsing the internet, the app sometimes quits halfway through a song and has to be restarted.  Overall, this app has some challenges to overcome, but it gets the job done most of the time. After all, if I'm listening from my Kindle Fire, I'm not exactly in search of a premier audio listening experience."
"on October 10, 2015","I totally love Spotify, no doubt. But heck, I am having a hard time on this because I can't listen offline and even though I already updated this app, it keeps on saying that I need to upgrade to listen offline. Can you please fix it?"
"on November 2, 2017","Bombdotcom"
"on March 26, 2017","Good music"
"on March 6, 2015","This has to be the best music app out there. I love how you can pick any song you want and it will play. I have absolutely no contemplates about the app. I will never use Pandora again!"
"on July 4, 2016","This app is better than Pandora. With Pandora you have to listen to ask these other songs but with Spotify you get to listen to one song at a time with premium of course."
"on August 24, 2016","Best music app out there"
"on July 3, 2017","Spotify is awesome! I can play my favorite songs anytime. There are few ads and you can create your own playslists."
"on May 5, 2015","Awesome. Just pure awesome. Any genre, any artist, any song, any mood playlist, whatever, for free. And all you have to deal with are ads (and finding a Wi-Fi zone as well.). And if an artist releases a new album, you can listen to it almost immediately after the release."
"on April 4, 2017","The selection of music is great, but there are unrelenting commercials that prevent you from listening to the music"
"on March 14, 2016","quite possibly the best app for music. I am a premium member so I get to listen to whatever I want, when I want with no adds or added songs. Great selection and I dont think I could live without"
"on August 31, 2015","Been a huge fan ever since Sony jumped on board. I love the &#34;artist radio&#34; as a great way to discover similar artists with great albums. I also love to see companies adopt 3rd party solutions (reminds me of the Windows XP days)."
"on September 20, 2015","This app is the most awesome ever! Over the years I have lost at least a thousand vinyl albums and CD's for many different reasons. With Spotify, I can have that music again and I don't have to worry about shelf space or losing them again!"
"on November 30, 2016","Spotify is very good if your on the go you can create playlist and save and download your favorite songs and artist and listen offline"
"on December 24, 2016","I still cannot believe how fast and extensive the range of music is and the ease with which one can produce and access playlists."
"on September 29, 2015","I was so happy when my sister told me about this app. I like to listen to music while I work so it was nice not having to find a new song on YouTube every time a song ended. Get Spotify if you dont have pandora on your hand held device."
"on March 27, 2017","I love Spotify. I have just about every artist that I love."
"on June 22, 2016","This app is so awesome u can listen to so much music. The only thing I don't like is how u only get 5skips and when u use all of the u have to wait one hour for 5 new skips"
"on October 23, 2015","Spotify is the app I use the most. It's my constant companion in the car, at home, at work. The Discover Weekly playlist has introduced me to tons of songs and artists I now love, and reminded me of others that I forgot I enjoyed."
"on April 28, 2016","Would be nice to be able to cut the ads down on the unpaid version. I love the fact that unlike youtube, this thing keeps playing in the background while I do other stuff on my android."
"on May 31, 2017","Impressed"
"on December 27, 2015","It has all these adds that say get premium blah blah blah and when I click on it it won't let me get it and also I used to be able to listen to music without wifi but now I can't and I have to get premium to do it."
"on March 2, 2015","I think it a great app except when I want to listen to the album consecutively, it won't let me. I have to listen in the random mode. I wanted to become a premium member, but there isn't any easy way to do that. If I could have figured that out Spotify would have gotten the high five."
"on July 7, 2016","This app is really good for listening to music and the sound quality is good. I just wish they had more of Taylor Swift and other artists. Also at this point my spotify/kindle has glitches and I can't pull down the top of my screen and see the Spotify tab to skip forward and/or back. Other than that, this is a great app! However, when the trailer for “ The Visit "" came out, Spotify kept playing that trailer and it freaked me out. But just get premium if that's a problem. They have really great deals. So I would highly recommend this app for all the music lovers. ( LIKE MEH!!! ) 🎆🎆🎆"
"on June 8, 2017","A lot better than Amazon music, more music and worth it!!! Another way to see what your friends are listening to."
"on April 15, 2017","It works better than the normal radio apps, and it does a good job recommending music. It's also very easy to use."
"on December 30, 2015","On my S5, this app is amazing. On my fire hd tablet, however, I often times have to manually skip to the next song. For whatever reason it doesn't always play through my entire playlist. It gets annoying. If they fixed that, I would give it a 5 star though."
"on July 31, 2016","App works pretty nicely. Only drawback is lots of commercials before switching to premium. Premium also gives full functionality which helps me like the app more."
"on September 17, 2015","Regardless of what mood I'm in there's always music for it. I can let Spotify shuffle songs for me by listening to the radio. Or if I want to hear a specific song I can search exactly for that. I can't find a single fault! I love spotify!"
"on January 12, 2016","Aside from the mobility issue since you need premium to listen without WiFi or data, the fact you can't play specific songs on android or Apple phones, it's the perfect music app for kindle or stationary devices like pc."
"on December 12, 2015","Spotify is great for listening to your favorite music and discovering new music. Making your own playlists is a snap, and the radio option is pretty snazzy too. I love Spotify more than any other music app I've tried."
"on January 1, 2017","Got for my Kindle Fire. Invested in family Premium, now it's perfect for the gym. I love Spotify and the app is great on Kindle."
"on November 13, 2014","Everything you could dream it to be as long as you don't care that T.Swift, Aldean, or the real Beatles aren't on there ;) Are they missed? Yes. Do I really care that much? No. My husband has the premium version and it's worth it to be able to take your playlists on the road with you. I'll probably upgrade soon."
"on July 24, 2015","Awesome when u have premium... but it is also very cool if you don't want to spend the money to get premium. You just can't listen to it offline. I enjoy listening to music whenever I'm bored so it can cheer me up. Definitely a 5 star. Must have. :)"
"on June 7, 2017","This is the best app"
"on August 11, 2016","I love spotify because it lets me search for the music that I like. I definitely recommend this app for your friends. I'm not sure about the long startup time."
"on June 10, 2017","I love this app I can play whatever song I want on cue and make playlist with my own favorite music"
"on August 1, 2017","Good App"
"on May 26, 2017","I love the fact that we can created our own station way better than Pandora😌😌😌😌😌😇😇💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖🎶🎵🎼"
"on May 4, 2017","Excellent app for just chillin out with your friends or your self for a good jam sesh, would defiantly recommend."
"on July 15, 2016","Unable to filter explicit language"
"on October 26, 2015","It's good when you have premium but if you're like me the Commercials didn't bother me that much. I would listen to commercials but now I tried out premium I'm positive premium is worth it. I would recommend it to all my friends"
"on January 19, 2016","This app works perfectly well, and I love it! The music they have is great, even though they don't have Taylor Swift songs. Spotify Premium is better, but even if you don't go premium this app works awesome."
"on March 22, 2017","Great app. If you enjoy music at all its awesome to have. Take your music everywhere! You can make your own playlists. Totally worth downloading."
"on August 24, 2016","Love it reallly helped"
"on October 7, 2015","I've been using Spotify for about a year to check out c new artists as well as listening to my favorites. Such a fantastic app! And a bonus is the Spotify sessions or exclusive content you can't find on iTunes. I finally subscribed!"
"on January 18, 2016","I love this app. I have it downloaded on all my devices. The weekly discover playlist is one of my favorite features... you won't regret becoming a premium member unless you don't really like music, I guess."
"on May 9, 2016","Music cuts in and out. Song ends before its finished."
"on March 20, 2015","I love spotify I've been a listener since 2010, all my friends recommended (Pandora). every time I tried it was like Pandora came out the box if you know what I am getting at. But I'm a spotifyer so I need to know what do I click on so I can b Subscribe for or buy Premium??"
"on August 14, 2017","So much music. Problem is how to handle it."
"on November 7, 2016","It will let me listen to 1 or 2 songs and then it will just quit playing, before I never had any problems with it until an hour or 2 ago."
"on February 3, 2016","Very good app allows you to get basically any song you want for free. Of course there are some songs not on their and the ads are annoying. But overall the best platform to get real published good songs."
"on June 22, 2017","You can create your own playlist others you can't. Also you can transfer it to your iPod for free."
"on May 30, 2017","OMG!!! It is good, especially when your going to sleep listen too. Hope you like it as much as me."
"on April 6, 2016","They have all the latest songs even though it is free. This better than pandora because it doesn't have as any ads"
"on November 22, 2014","I I love.listing to music and this makes me want even more to listen to music it is the best u can find any song you like and it would venture and then you can add it to your favorite song and then shuffle play when you have a lot of sings and you can listen to all them! (Short story... need to get it)"
"on June 15, 2017","Good, a little difficult to use"
"on June 21, 2015","I love using Spotify. I am able to listen to specific artist albums or songs. The only thing I have a concern about since this was available on my new Kindel Fire HD, is the service going to continue to be free, or will I have to begin to pay for the App."
"on October 29, 2015","All my favorite classic Brazilian bossa nova and jazz are there. The groups and sub-groups are very helpful. Amazing selection and the audio is really good if you use quality headphones. (I am using this app on a Kindle Fire)."
"on May 14, 2017","Love it"
"on March 27, 2017","Spotify has most of the music I isten to. I use this every day during work and at home definitely with it to me."

"on November 1, 2015","I love this app! It is easy to work. It is updated on music. The one thing I found not good was it doesn't have much Taylor Swift songs. It doesn't have bad blood. But that's a little thing so I give it 5/5 stars! GET IT NOW!"
"on April 5, 2016","I have been using Spotify for almost a year now, and I LOVE it! The quality is great, and premium is affordable. You can find the bands you love, and new ones. Can't go wrong with Spotify."
"on April 9, 2016","With almost any song, album, and/or artist you can think of, search what you want to listen to and there it is. Spotify has an amazing collection of music to listen to whenever you want."
"on October 18, 2014","I enjoy this app! It has all my favorites, which is amazing. However, sometimes when I have perfect WiFi, it says I have no internet connection, which is extremely annoying. I have to remove the app and reinstall in and log in again. Sometimes i have to do this several times in a week. Aside from that, it's amazing!"
"on January 31, 2017","I tell everyone to hook my phone up to their Bluetooth. Even my stubborn sister downloaded the app after hearing my playlists."
"on February 5, 2017","I love the fact that I can search for a particular song/album or can listen to suggested playlist created by other listeners"
"on July 3, 2015","I got a sample, was pretty happy. The time ran out so thought I would join. No way,no how. Aggravated me so kept try. Then I started checking on it , was very glad I didn't join to many horror stories for. Maybe they worked it out. But I won't try again."

"on October 18, 2017","Great!"
"on November 9, 2014","You can listen to every song you want and every artist for free all you need is a wifi connection. If you want to listen offline then upgrade which costs money but is worth it because you get every song for free and can listen offline which saves so much money rather than buying it from the Amazon music store."
"on August 22, 2016","This app lets you pick the songs you want to listen to,other than Pandora when you don't even know what song your listening to!  BY MADDIE BLOOM"
"on August 11, 2015","I love it. I don't have to wait till the end of a movie and go through all the music to try to remember what song I wanted to know the title of. I hear something I like, press the screen and almost instantly know the title, singer, and album."
"on October 29, 2015","As someone who deeply loves music, this app has made my days, my nights, my showers, my homework and study time, and practically everything better! :) It's amazing to be able to listen to almost any song you'd like so easily."

"on April 19, 2015","If you are a music freak you'll love Spotify. It has all types of music and you can download them onto your phone so you can listen to the music without the internet. Its pretty much the best app you can get if you listen to music 24/7. Its definitely worth the money every month"
"on June 1, 2016","Spotify is perfect for the shop, always something different and very helpful when looking for different music. Especially when the radio plays the same song 8 times an hour."
"on October 21, 2016","you have to download this app it's the best you can play anything and make your own personal playlists and listen to other's playlists too!"
"on April 2, 2016","I really enjoy my Spotify account. I have access to so much music and can find new bands and local bands where I live as well."
"on March 18, 2015","This app allow you to download most songs not all because they might not be there the only bad thing is the amount of skips you have an you have to be a member to play a song you want to hear instead of it being on shuffle which you can't get rid if unless you are a member."
"on March 10, 2016","This is a great app I love it. You choose all the music you like and save them to your library and/or playlist. Very simple app and easy to use. I listen everyday. Take I tunes music times 100"

"on September 18, 2014","My son uses the app and said he can get all the music he wants or needs. I downloaded the app and discovered it required a ""registration"" to run. I don't like apps that track users or require registration so I never registered and therefore it is non functional on my tablet. As for my son, he thinks its great!"
"on September 16, 2016","Love Spotify"
"on July 7, 2015","Does the job but keeps crashing. And the audio on the app isn't loud enough compared to when I stream songs on youtube. Ads are annoying and frequently freeze while they're playing so I can't listen to music for a while or I have to restart my kindle."
"on January 22, 2016","I LOVE Spotify!! I can search and listen to anyone I want, even bands that are barely around anymore!! I hate commercial interruptions, so I signed up for the monthly service, and I couldn't be happier!!"
"on December 20, 2016","I Love you Spotify, thanks so much for always supplying the best music of my choice! And your choices of music are good too!"
"on December 23, 2015","This is a great app, but on android to play music you have to click ""Shuffle"" to play music, but on iOS, you can play a song right away. I'd put five stars if you could play music right away on android."

"on June 26, 2017","I absolutely love the recommendations it gives and am definitely considering the monthly payments for premium"
"on March 21, 2016","I love using spotify, I use it all the time. In class, cleaning my room, doing my chores, and when I'm at the gym. I really enjoy being able to choose my music and add it to my playlists."
"on May 17, 2016","I actually prefer Spotify to Pandora. It is better because you have unlimited skips and thumbs downs. I especially like the artist radios. Really gives you the music you want."

"on September 23, 2017","Using spotify instead of Amazon. Thanks."

"on April 15, 2016","I love spotify! My favourite thing about it is that you can try the premium, but as a free 7 day trial... :)"
"on October 20, 2014","Love it less commercial ads! You get to listen to a lot of music before and ad comes on. The app also let's you try your music without commercials and offline for a free trial. I'm not sure if you have to pay for that feature after the trial period. Still trying to find that out. Otherwise a fantastic app."
"on March 3, 2017","Its pretty cool"

"on January 5, 2017","Works perfectly like Spotify on any other device ! Also the only way to listen to music on a kids profile on kindle fire."
"on November 8, 2016","All of the other music apps I've downloaded have been slow , don't have all the music I want , or are hard to use. Not Spotify!!!!!"
"on June 7, 2015","I love this one better than the other program we tried. This one is EASY to use and find songs! Really easy to download to your play list and to add to it! WONDERFUL! The other one was hard to figure out and you couldn't play the songs you wanted...."
"on July 21, 2015","I always used to use Pandora but then I found spotify and I fell in love with it. There is every artist you can think of as well as songs. If you are looking for a free music app I recommend this one. It's had some updates within the last month"
"on November 15, 2016","Too hard to get a song you want to hear....only option seems to be ""Shuffle Play"". I'm probably doing something wrong..."
"on March 5, 2016","Love this app! I listen at work, the gym & at home. Love that it is accessible on all my devices: phone, kindle, PC &laptop. Especially love the discover weekly to find new music."
"on October 2, 2014","I don't want to sound as if I am being cheap, but I've been waiting to put it on my Kindle without being charged for a long time. Why they didn't do this sooner I'll never know. It works very well for my needs and I am glad to have on my Kindle. I can now listen and enjoy the music I want. For those who gave this a three stars or lower I am sorry you did. It has a few bad points, but you have to over look them and move on. I mean for its free, and there's nothing perfect these days. Take my word for it, down load it and enjoy. It's free what more do you want?"
"on December 28, 2016","I love Spotify!!! I don't have Premium, but it is still so useful! I really love Pentatonix, so I put a bunch of there songs on a playlist. Premium costs money and I don't have it. You can't skip on the radios a lot, but you can on your playlists. I can turn my Fire 5th generation off and it still plays. I am listening to Dark Horse by Katy Perry right now while typing this review. The only thing I don't like are the ads, but that's to be expected."
"on March 17, 2017","Spotify gives a lot more freedom to you than Pandora in my opinion. And the Daily Mixes are the best."
"on June 18, 2017","It's Great! It has all your favorite music no matter what genre!"
"on August 25, 2016","You can't see the thriller behind what the break of dawn it has. Don't stop till you get enough of this app. It is so good for being bad like a jam."
"on April 25, 2016","My favorite music streaming app ever!! I have had a premium account since 2014, and just recently upgraded to the family plan. If you are a music buff I would recommend Spotify."
"on January 8, 2017","It is awesome better than sound cloud an other music apps and dowloader if you don't a music app be sure to get this one"
"on February 7, 2017","This is one of the two music app that use now (the other one is songza) and then. Though I use the other one more often."
"on December 20, 2016","While the premium version is really good it could be pricey for some, although the free version serves me perfectly fine"
"on September 10, 2017","This app is the best. I have the paid version and I only listen to All Star by Smashmouth. Best app for that hands down."
"on August 1, 2017","I miss the lyrics that the desktop version offered, but I guess they removed this also👎 otherwise perfect...Great job.."
"on January 4, 2017","Spotify is so easy to use. They have all my favorite artists, and all my favorite songs. Best on demand music out there."

"on November 2, 2017","Love it.....has all the music I want."
"on November 6, 2017","Very nice!!!"
"on September 27, 2017","I had Spotify for a while but I decided to cancel cause it’s a little pricey."
"on January 11, 2015","Unlike Pandora and Songza, once the music started on Spotify Music, I could find no obvious way to stop the app without logging-out. If there is an ""X"" or ""Quit"" it is well hidden.  I did enjoy the music collections once I found them. There was quiet a variety to choose from. The sound quality was good on my Droid Turbo. The app did not always recognize my WiFi connection even when at 100% signal strength, telling me ""no internet connection.""  Generally speaking I found this app to be overly complicated and lacking intuitive usage control. Yet the app has quite a following. As such I speculate it may be targeted at a demographic younger than my own.  If you enjoy apps that require (in my opinion) a lot of interaction and (seem) heavily oriented to social media you may find Spotify Music worthwhile. It wasn't for me."
"on May 12, 2016","GREAT!!! It's amazing and prime is so worth it. But it's shuffle is not the best buts still incredible variety of music, I totally recommend that you download this app!!!!!!"
"on November 21, 2014","I have been a premium member for more than a year now. I have three sons with smartphones and they all have this app. Since a year ago I don't buy a CD or buy online music.

"on June 8, 2017","love spotify, soooo easy"
"on February 24, 2016","Spotify is hands down the best music app I have downloaded. It has all my favorite music that I love to listen to on a daily basis. Being able to listen off line anywhere is the best feature"
"on January 3, 2015","I love this app, I use it 24/7. I have had this app for 2 days and I Love it. My dad had this app on his iPhone and he really likes it so I thought I would try it out.

"on April 2, 2016","You can easily find and listen to any and all songs from your favorite artists, even the obscure ones, at ANY time."
"on October 9, 2015","This app started out great. I used it all the time but ever since I updated it they require you to upgrade to premium just so you can turn off shuffle mode and I think that is absolutely ridicules. Do not download this app."
"on May 24, 2016","Our entire family loves spotify! About 2x a year they offer a free trial subscription: 3 months for 99 cents. we usually just get the memberships when we are traveling!"
"on January 20, 2017","With Amazon Alexa its great....play what you want, create your own playlists and daily suggested stations. Love it !!!"
"on September 9, 2016","Relatively easy to figure out as far as utilization. Still experimenting with the ""correct"" approach,but worth hanging in to discover."
"on March 28, 2015","Great selection of music. Hate that it's shuffle play only and that random songs play based on your other selections. I wish premium was cheaper so I could play anything I wanted. I really like that there's a vast selection of kid songs for my 2 and 6 yr old children."
"on December 6, 2016","I really like that you can listen to the exact songs you want. You can also find genres, artists, and albums. Its awesome."

"on July 12, 2017","Great. Been able to do homework and sleep better than ever before!💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖"
"on October 6, 2014","I think that it is very annoying that I have the free mode so I can't listen to any song I want I have to listen to all of the other songs and wait till I get to the song I want and also you ONLY get 6 skips so you can ONLY skip 6 times then u have to wait an hour  other than that is a good app"
"on October 23, 2017","The GOAT music service."
"on September 29, 2015","I'm a nanny and we have so much fun dancing to music I find here. Then I have my own that are just for me."

"on March 13, 2015","This is SO AWESOME!!!! I should be able to listen to any song I request versus Pandora when you have to have them control your music and with those God Awful ads what are so annoying. Dont forget the fact that you can only skip so many songs, That sucks!!! Love Spotify."

"on March 31, 2016","This is the best music app ever! You can listen to pretty much whatever you want even full albums with little ads or go premium and have no ads. Worth downloading and trying out."
"on September 6, 2014","Spotify is awesome and VERY easy to use! I like that you can make your own playlists of your favorite artists by just listening to the stations you have. I also enjoy the suggestions and the trending stations or music. That feature is very handy, especially when you first get the app! Definitely a five star rating!"

"on August 9, 2014","I absolutely love this app there wasn't a song that I looked for that I couldn't find. It even finds the album that the song came from. You can even save the whole album itself if you wanted too. I even created a slow jams play list and I love it cause it's a combination of old and new songs it's a perfect blend."
"on December 1, 2014","The best music app ever. This is amazing because you can pick your own music for a play list. All the top hits-here. All the 70s music-here. And, great for the holidays. Only problem is that there is commercials A LOT. Otherwise, BEST MUSIC APP EVER. Maybe even better than Pandora! ;)"
"on June 27, 2016","It gets better and better! They have so many varieties of music, get new music fast, and have ads where if you listen to it, you get 30 mins ad free. Love it!"

"on August 19, 2016","Love the Spotify app! Especially the ability to create numerous playlists. Wish I could suggest artists and certain songs to be added to Spotify."
"on June 18, 2015","Spotify is great for music- it's like a mix of Pandora and Soundcloud. You can both listen to individual songs (and even put them in playlists) but also listen to specific ""stations"" for songs, like on Pandora. Overall, freakin awesome."
"on January 1, 2015","Still trying to poke around to figure this out, but so far it seems like a great music app."
"on December 8, 2014","I was just using the music download app it was good but couldn't shuffle and had trouble changing songs but this as long as you are in WiFi (or pay the dollar to make it available offline work awesome it even gives you recommendations and tells you when the band is on tour. It amazes me"
"on March 1, 2016","The only reason I didn't give five stars is because it often pauses at the end of a song. Before it will start again I have to go back to the play list and press play for the next song."
"on August 14, 2016","Love it guys exultantly well done does need a way of listening to it even with premium with no WiFi it'd be nice but wonderful job so far.😍😍😍😍"

"on May 14, 2017","I've been using it for years and it's amazing!"
"on June 15, 2017","For student discount ($4.99\ month), so incredibly worth it for the Premium membership!"
"on April 29, 2017","I'm not really big on Spotify. I don't care for it but my husband and daughter love it."
"on September 23, 2015","Used to be really great before they switched it to where only premium members get to pick songs. Now with the skip limits and the only allowing shuffle play, it might as well be just like Pandora. Only Pandora has less ads."
"on January 12, 2017","great variety..listen to it everyday"
"on September 8, 2017","East to use and selection or music / artists covers all tastes in music. Also don't forget podcasts !"

"on March 7, 2016","Actually like better than Pandora! Easier to find songs & playlists on Spotify. Spotify playlists, should I chose to use, also have more content I actually enjoy. Highly recommended!"

"on July 11, 2017","A Very good app. I would recommand it to everyone out there"
"on December 30, 2015","All the different music choices and the great selection of artists is what makes spotify a must have. Plus I don't have to make my own playlists because a lot of people have taste in music like mine."
"on December 30, 2016","The BEST music app. The only issue for me is that I am cheap and don't want to pay for prime and thus off line use."
"on May 6, 2016","This is a great app because: 1)You get a 7 day free trial of free music when u make an account. 2)Music is clear and not bad.  Discovering New music every day!"
"on January 27, 2017","Supercharged music app with an enormous library. The selection of podcasts is notable as well. Premium is worth it!"
"on August 30, 2015","Has everything it's perfect. But it doesn't have Tool. If you don't what tool is, it's a very very well known, grunge, metal, alternative band. It's not that big of a deal but it just surprises me so much cuz it has everything."
"on January 23, 2016","Great music! I've been listening on my smart phone while I work at home. I have the option of listening to many eras and genres. So glad I got the tip from Starbucks to sign up with Spotify."
"on March 12, 2015","It's really good it's well....... I don't know it's just good wait no it's GREAT!"
"on September 15, 2015","I love this App because I love how I can make my n own Playlist and I don't have to deal with random picking by just what b I thumbs up like in Pandora radio. It has pretty much all music and more. Good app worth paying for."
"on October 26, 2015","Spotify is great in the sense that you can make your own playlists, however, you should be able to choose the song you want to listen to instead of having to shuffle and hope you get the song you want to listen to."
"on June 24, 2017","This app changes how music is made!!! Love it"
"on September 24, 2017","Too much buffering. Prefer Amazon Music App."
"on October 15, 2016","It's GREAT :) you can listen to all sorts of music I enjoy it and recommend. The only thing is you need premium to listen offline."
"on May 27, 2017","The app great, but it constantly freezes at random or as soon as you go any other tab."
"on July 23, 2017","Love it"
"on December 10, 2015","Spotify is incredible! All my inspiration comes from the music that Spotify provides for me. I thank those deeply who made Spotify, and I recommend this app to anyone and everyone who enjoys a good tune."
"on July 15, 2017","The app is a little laggy and there isn't very much Eminem songs on it but other than that its great"
"on January 1, 2016","I found Spotify three years ago, and this music enthusiast was hooked! After I bought my Kindle HDX two years ago, I immediately downloaded the Spotify app. I have never been disappointed. The only drawback is the amount of room needed to store any music on your device. For example, taking into account all of the songs, albums, and playlists I have, it encompasses almost 5 gigs of my tablet to store my music. It's all relative to the amount of total space your tablet or phone has available."
"on September 18, 2017","Best purchase ever!"
"on October 28, 2017","All works great. 🎉"
"on September 15, 2017","I love Spotify... easy navigation throughout the app and the music choices get better and better the more I use it"

"on February 20, 2015","It'll do."
"on September 14, 2016","Consistently great. Easy to use and intuitive. Great for making playlists and then building on them with Spotify's intuitive suggestions."
"on October 21, 2016","Best music app on blackberry. Not a lot of good apps on blackberry world so I was happy when I saw this on the amazon app store."
"on August 4, 2014","I thought I'd never leave Pandora, but someone made me try Spotify and I haven't looked back since. You can do a ""radio"" feature, but even better than that is that you can download the songs that you like the most, so you aren't wasting your cell data plan. Just download the music over Wifi and take it to go!"
"on December 2, 2016","My sister-in-law suggested this to me. She is a big fan and thought that I would like it also. Have not used it yet."
"on July 28, 2016","Great music, but the app keeps freezing on my Kindle so I need to turn my device completely off to stop the music. I guess I will stay with Pandora."
"on January 18, 2016","This is a really great app and I highly recommend it. In some ways it is better than Pandora, but if you are someone like me and loves music than I would definitely chose spotify over Pandora."
"on February 22, 2015","this app is a great app for people who love music it has all the genres you can think of and more you can create you own play lists and share them I only have the free version but it's one of the best apps I have so if your looking for a great app for music get this one"

"on May 27, 2017","Great mix of new and old. Helps guide me to music I never would have found otherwise."
"on December 17, 2016","Love it. I can create my own list. Or use existing ones. It's great to look up songs for the perfect sound choice."
"on April 29, 2016","This is a pretty great app, I really like being able making my own playlists right on my kindle. There is not much else I can say, it is Spotify of course it is awesome."
"on December 31, 2015","I am amazed at all the music I have found using Spotify. Great app for hard to find music. I have found just about everything I have thought of looking for. I highly recommend it with enthusiasm!"
"on July 10, 2017","Love it.. Nothing else to say. Has a huge variety of music I always find what I want I use it daily"

"on January 5, 2017","I love the 80's music and its so easy to find songs and download so far ive found everything ive been looking for"
"on October 6, 2015","Received it on Oct 5 and not not sure if it's going to work. It connected easily but has been getting it's first charge so hasn't been used yet. My previous one lasted five years. If this is as good, I'll be happy."
"on July 20, 2016","Love listening to spotify radio. Love getting recommendations through browse and love the diversity of music it offers. It's the best music app ever!"
"on July 24, 2016","I no longer have to buy all songs from ITunes. It was my 13 year old granddaughter that showed me how to get the app and get all types of free music"
"on December 19, 2015","I do pay the $10 a month for the premium because commercials drive me insane but even before I did I absolutely loved it which is why I chose to invest in the upgrade. Totally worth it in my opinion."
"on July 16, 2017","Love it. Could be more easier."
"on February 28, 2016","My friends and I love music!! When we quickly just want to listen to music we download/open spotify, press shuffle play, and jam out together!!! You NEED to gtg Spotify right NOW!!!!"

"on July 16, 2015","I am really impressed with the variety of artists and music,very easy to use.The only down side is that it is kind of expensive for a basic subscription,and you don't get many options with the free veraion,but is still a really good app"
"on October 2, 2016","Enjoying the app! Enjoying the app! Enjoying the app! Enjoying the app! Enjoying the app! Enjoying the app! Enjoying the app!"
"on April 12, 2016","Spotify let's you listen to whatever song you want. You can repeat songs, skip, and randomize your favourite tracks. They also have developed soundtracks for everyday life."
"on February 28, 2015","Better than Pandora."
"on June 9, 2017","Great app. You get a 7-Day free trial. I highly recommended this app for anybody that wants music."
"on January 15, 2015","Amazing. Fun to explore."

"on July 26, 2016","Great selection!"
"on November 19, 2014","I have no idea what I did before Spotify. There are very few songs or artists that I haven't found. Making playlists is a breeze and taking music wherever I go is so awesome. I tell everybody to get this app. And the premium version really does pay for itself. Definitely a 5 star rating!"
"on October 13, 2015","Keep doing what you guys are doing. Get the rights to play Beatles music and the Travelling Wilburys."

"on August 24, 2016","love it"
"on July 22, 2015","Spotify was a great app and worked seemlesly on my BlackBerry Z30, until the new update. Music used to play steady even after I went under the tunnel on the subway. Now the music breaks down at times like a scratched CD and cuts off."
"on October 1, 2015","I love Spotify! I tried a few others music apps and always go back to Spotify! So no more other music apps. I put all my favorites in one playlist and I also love to search and listen/follow other playlist! Fantastic music app."
"on August 18, 2015","Its great but, I can't play it offline... I can't figure out how to get it to work offline..."
"on March 6, 2015","Spotify is amazing, and I highly recommend the app. It works best if you have the paid service. The only drawback is that the mobile version does not allow you to view the words to songs as you listen (you can do that on a regular computer via an in-app program)."
"on June 16, 2014","I love this app!  The only one thing I would change would be not needing internet connection bc riding in the car for long distances is the main time I would love to listen to it but other wise this app is perfect and I would change nothing else!  I think everyone should get this app   God bless"
"on October 3, 2016","Spotify works better on my kindle than my iPhone! It sounds great, easy to navigate, and very fast. I'm very very pleased with it."
"on December 25, 2016","I mostly listen to classical, 19th century popular music, and jazz. The selection is good enough that I rarely listen to my CD collection anymore. But the computer app for my iMac, running the latest OS, is a memory hog. I find the interface to be cluttered. The ability to order & retrieve saved albums is not very flexible. I will note, however, that the interface is constantly being improved - it's better now than when I first bought it.  And Spotify really ought to figure out how to set up a tip jar for the artists."
"on March 28, 2015","My whole Spotify Music app got stuck at the very beginning of their own advertisement.  It remains frozen without capability of listening to further musical use. I liked the app overall, could some representative please fix this bug I'm experiencing?"

"on October 21, 2015","I love spotify. It's so much better than Pandora. I like how you have a variety of categories. But one thing I would change would make it unlimited skips. Above all, Spotify is great and I strongly recommend it."
"on February 20, 2017","I have had spotify for years and it still is working better than ever. You can create play lists with song you love or listen to ones other listeners create. Discover music or rediscover either way spotify is the best way to access music of any kind."
"on May 10, 2015","I have had this app for at least 4 years and it always works!!! It has never broken down and the music is consistently updated so there is everything that I want on it! I recommend this app for anyone that likes music!!!😁😁 BEST MUSIC APP EVER!!!!!"
"on July 8, 2017","This is a really great app👍"
"on April 14, 2017","Great songs from old to new."
"on September 13, 2017","Never works for blackberry passport silver edition"
"on November 14, 2014","Once I got my kindle I asked if I can BUY music and the answer was no. I was upset `cause I love music and the other respond was but you can get spotify....... ok I'll get to the point........so you can download music and hear it anywhere, in mountains and at home I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!"
"on February 11, 2015","If you are looking for a easy to use music that works then you have to get this app. You could get over a hundred songs and they are free songs. This app I have used before and it is just as good as on the computer as it is on mobile. Best App for music you could get"
"on September 29, 2017","I like how accessible it makes music and how you can make your own library of songs and playists"
"on February 10, 2016","I have been able to find every song I was looking for. I would definitely recommend this app for anyone who is looking for a good music app that you can put the songs you like most on."
"on February 23, 2015","This is by far my most important app. I BlueTooth it at work off the company's WiFi. I use it at home off of my WiFi. I just bought a new car and it has BlueTooth. I put all my songs on 'available offline' and now the car rocks with Spotify. Essential app I tell ya!"
"on December 27, 2014","I've never paid for spotify so my one and only gripe is that it sucks the life out of my data plan... I'm not sure if paying for it would solve that issue but if $10/month would do it, I'd start tomorrow! As long as you expect ads, this is the best free music server out there."
"on December 30, 2016","Easily giving Spotify 5 stars because I have it on all my devices and it has never disappointed me👌👌👍👍👏👏"
"on December 27, 2014","It is pretty good but there are a few cons one is that you need a premium membership to use it with out Wi-Fi and there's WAY too many ads and one more is that you need too search for a lot of the music and you can't change your username. Please look at this before you get it."
"on October 20, 2014","This app works really well and it has almost every song you can think of with some exceptions. I wish that there would have been a tutorial on how to use it. Another thing is that this almost sounds too good to be true like there might be some sort of catch to it. Overall really nice though."
"on January 21, 2016","Spotify is so great,I love this app it made my music more fun and I live how you can make your own playlist, I will recommended this to every one you will have the most time of your life ."
"on March 3, 2016","I have music going every day no matter what I'm doing... the variety of spotify makes it way more enjoyable. After trying MANY apps I stuck with this one and highly recommend it!"
"on February 15, 2016","I love the variety of music available here. I can find almost anything here, whether current or recorded in 1920. This is by Far the most comprehensive source of recorded music."
"on May 29, 2017","Great selection of music I am able to listen to a diverse music line-up everyday."
"on August 5, 2015","Spotify is my go to app! I love the variety it picks for me with my input. I use it daily and don't know what I would do without it. My list is constantly growing with songs and artists. My daughter likes to use my lists too."
"on October 27, 2014","Rather enjoyable. ...definitely recommend☆"
"on June 18, 2017","Awesome got new headphones not that many adds. Not all the songs I'd like but that's fine."
"on March 22, 2016","I like this because when I want to listen to one artist in particular, that is all the music I get from that one artist. Will never go back to other music listening choices."
"on April 27, 2016","The best app ever for real, I've found songs I haven't heard in years plus all the newest stuff you could want! Its also a great way to share playlists with friends."
"on June 3, 2017","It's the best."
"on January 13, 2015","I LOVE Spotify.. i can't believe I had an aversion to change (from Pandora).. my husband suggested it and now i use it at the gym all the time (like in 10 min lol).. Get the app.. I pay for premium and love it. i get the student discount .. 4.99 a month. so 5.40 with tax!"
"on April 26, 2016","Plays the music I like to listen to"
"on November 10, 2014","best music app ever! Very friendly interface and works fast, nice functionality. Spotify lets me listen to old hits and be on top with new ones. I use it together with soundhound, because it lets me catch songs which fall into my ear. I strongly recommend this app for all music lovers."
"on February 10, 2016","I absolutely love this app. I use this so much more than Pandora. In fact, I don't even remember the last time I opened Pandora. It's the best music app I've invested in, hands down."
"on October 3, 2015","The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead if 5 is because you can't listen to the music offline unless you pay like $10 a month.... Other than that, I think Spotify Is one of the best music apps ever!!!😆😆😆"
"on April 3, 2017","Wish it didn't need WiFi most the time but everything is amazing and works well."
"on September 19, 2017","It is better than Pandora!!! I love it!"
"on August 8, 2017","If you don't have pay for unlimited it doesn't work well with Echo"
"on April 28, 2017","my favorite music app of all time. waaaayyyyyy better than pandora"
"on November 26, 2015","It let's me play any music I want and for free! Amazing I say because it has music that you have to pay $10.00 for in stores. I listen to it every day😇 It was definitely worth it.🎧🎤📼🎵🎶🎼🎻🎹🎷🎸"
"on April 16, 2015","I LOVE this app to pieces but there is one problem. There's no premium on the app store like it said I even checked goggle play store! Why I want premium is because you can go offline and listen to music. I don't care about adds I want to listen music!"
"on May 26, 2015","I love that I can create multiple playlists of music based upon tempo or theme. It's like have access to multiple CDs. Great app. Just wish I could afford a premium subscription to get rid of ads. So far I like this much more than Pandora."
"on November 4, 2017","LOVE this app"
"on November 2, 2014","Spotify is the most amazing music app I have ever downloaded, it lets you take your music anywhere you go if you have premium, that's why I rate it 4 stars, because for some reason it won't let me get premium on my kindle fire, once it will let me, then I shall give it a perfect 5 stars"
"on July 11, 2016","I love this app its really cool and my favorite song is IM A PRETTY GIRL by pewdiepie. And its a really cool way to not bored when going campingXD"
"on December 10, 2016","I can listen to all my favorite songs here when ever,where ever,and how ever I want. This app is very helpful."
"on February 7, 2016","Best app to play music on!!! Love it so much! I plat it all the time, and I still have not gotten premium. I can still listen to music there is just some adds every once and a while."
"on January 19, 2015","Very easy to use and in my opinion better than Pandora if you have particular artists or albums you want to listen to. I use this with the Bluetooth feature on my kindle fire to listen to high quality music on my home stereo. I wish I would have downloaded this sooner."
"on November 5, 2016","Just what I want to hear, whenever I want to hear it! This app is easy to use and opens my ears to lots of new music!"
"on March 10, 2017","I love this app... Works great a few artist have not gone here but I can find them other ways"
"on March 11, 2017","It is great I love it so much☺😇♥🎶🎶🎼🎵🎻🎹🎷🎺🎧📼🎸〽💓💜💟💛💞💚💝💙💘❤💗💖💕👌✌👍"
"on July 13, 2014","Well designed user experience and great catalogue of music, however desperately needs Chromecast support. Also, needs to add support for up to 5 synced devices because the cost is bordering on too high. Strongly considering the Google Play Music streaming service but for now the catelogue is not as extensive."
"on January 13, 2015","This app is a godsend. I can listen to any song I think of, without having to buy it or wait for it to play on Pandora on some radio. My only concern is how they stay afloat financially, but that's not really my business. Overall, definitely deserving of all five stars!"
"on December 25, 2015","Brought the premium subscription I couldn't have been happier! I save all my music straight to my Fire Tablet and listen to it all day regardless of where I am, WiFi or no WiFi, it's available"
"on April 27, 2016","I can't figure out how to go premium, it sucks not app but that and u can't listen to it everywhere unless u got internet or data, but I guess other than its good."
"on January 16, 2017","I love this app! All the band's I love and available on all my devices! Even Alexa. Well worth the premium!"
"on January 17, 2017","How can you give this up so awesome 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎"
"on January 9, 2017","this app named spotify is perfect when you need to listen to music ,it is the best music app i ever used 😁"
"on January 23, 2017","I will keep it wherever I go like for exercises and workouts. That's what keeps me activated and motivated."
"on November 26, 2016","Been using the app across various devices for moinths. No complaints at all."
"on December 19, 2015","It is one of a kind because it is not like any other music app all the songs are free and you get to choose them and they have the newest like adele hello and old like ice ice baby  !"
"on December 28, 2014","Almost perfect. There are some minor organizational problems that prevent 5 stars. Things that you can do on your pc but not tablet, like rearrange your downloaded playlists by artist for example. It can be annoying when try ing to find that one song in a list of hundreds."
"on January 25, 2016","Spotify Music is a great way to listen to music for me because I get to listen to artists and albums, or create a playlist of my favorite songs, and it's perfect for my tablet as well."
"on August 17, 2016","Solid user interface, with a massive selection. I especially love the related artists feature. It does a lot to help you find new music."
"on March 6, 2016","An excelent service but the app must need improvement (don't have many play options, is hard to find the playlists, the options buttons are too small, and a few more things)."
"on June 1, 2016","Love this app I listen to Becky g all the time you could hear music with out network but you have to save theme you should get this app love it 💖💖💖💖👍"
"on April 20, 2016","As I'm doing this review im listening to my fav band I-/. I absolutely love Spotify and recommend it to all who have to go on those boring looong road trips.🎶🎶✌🐈"
"on July 31, 2014","This is one of the best music apps on the appstore. Its awesome to be able to create your own playlist. The only thing i would reccomend is mixing up the radio music a little more, sometimes ill get the same song twice in a row or just the same set of songs over and over but other than that, no complaints"
"on October 16, 2017","Great even with the ads."
"on August 17, 2017","It take a few seconds to open, but after that it works excellent"
"on August 16, 2016","Spotify has changed my life. I am always on it making new playlists or listening to the amazing premade ones on here. 10/10 do recommend"
"on October 31, 2016","I am enjoying the music very much, being a college grad in Music Ed., I have always loved music. This is great for me."
"on December 3, 2016","I really enjoy this music app!This is the best music app out there! I can find any song that comes to my mind!"
"on August 21, 2014","Spotify is possibly the most useful music app I have ever used. It is easy to find new music, browse old music, compile playlists, and listen to other people's playlists with it. I am so happy with the quality and speed. No complaints except for the infrequent and short commercials, no bother though."
"on February 4, 2016","Huge variety of music. Easy to surf on the site to look for your favourites or to discover new stuff. a ""must have"" for all music aficionados. Great job Spotify! Keep it up!"
"on October 12, 2017","Great way to get all the music you want"
"on October 4, 2017","I absolutely love spotify, just widh they had a real live customer service instead of chat and email only."
"on February 14, 2017","Is a great app for music, at home or on the go. I don't leave home without it on my phone & my Kindle"
"on December 30, 2016","Love love love Spotify! Way better than Pandora, I can pick and choose playlists and it is so easy to use."
"on July 26, 2016","It's great"
"on April 16, 2016","This is my go to music app because I can actually choose which songs to play unlike with I Heart Radio"
"on December 29, 2014","I love it, I was spending anywhere from $20 to $25 a month on music with I tunes, over what my budget allowed, I love that I pay one payment a month and can download all the music I want, it is also great in that it is easy to browse and discover new music and new artist."
"on September 12, 2015","I love using Spotify! Even though I don't have the premium yet, it's still great when you're using the free version. The only downside is not being able to save music for offline use, otherwise I would use this 24/7"
"on January 8, 2016","Maybe there are better apps out there but this one is perfect for me. I love that you can make your own playlists and they even have their own depending on how your feeling that day."
"on July 31, 2016","It doesn't have a lot of stations and some of the music I wanted. Happy it's free but wouldn't want to pay for it. It also has Comercials ."
"on September 28, 2014","Ok so this app was amazing but it updated yesterday and since then it hasn't been work at all. To get a song to play, I have to skip forward to the next song and then back to it. Even then, the track will sometimes magically become ""unavailable"". I hope they release a bug fix soon."
"on August 23, 2016"," "
"on June 18, 2017","This app is light and easy to use. Spotify Premium is also entirely worth it."
"on September 20, 2017","It pets play music nearly anywhere and itngives you ads only every 30 minutes"
"on September 10, 2015","It used to be awesome it still is but users you have been warned at least on my kindle you can't select your music anymore besides for putting it on shuffle mode I don't know if its an error but I hope it gets fixed"
"on December 18, 2014","""Awesome"" no broken songs- full download!Its how downloading music should be!"
"on September 14, 2017","Even with the occasional ad on the free account I love Spotify."
"on July 16, 2017","It Has All The Music I Want And The Premium Is Even Better!!!😄"
"on May 20, 2017","So good it knows lots of good songs and its better than pandora"
"on June 21, 2017","nearly perfect! 95% of searches successful. Still finding new fun options after 2 months."
"on March 24, 2017","I like that instead of a random song you actually get to choose it its amazing!!!😁😁😁😁😁"
"on January 10, 2016","If we were using useless Pandora we would not be able to listen to songs we can wont to listen to  Ttttttttttthhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaannnnnnnkkkk yyyyyyyooooooooouuuuuuuuu  Spotify"
"on April 19, 2016","New music is usually available the day of release depending on the artist. I listen to hip hop of all the decades as well as their gym playlists to stay motivated!"
"on September 27, 2015","I think this is the best app ever because you gear to play songs any time you want. The only kick is you either need to have WiFi or get premium. When you are not allowed to play songs, just delete and download."
"on February 9, 2017","I don't want to pay for music, and this is an option. It does have an annoying amount of advertisements."
"on January 18, 2017","Great app. Lots of music to choose from. If you have Spotify premium its the best music app in my opinion"
"on January 4, 2017","It even has playlists specifically for stuff your doing or moods your in so u don't have to make your own"
"on August 29, 2017","Perfect for me. A new workout playlist every day."
"on August 19, 2014","Great set up and everything but my sister got your offline free trial for 30 days and only got it for a week. Also it got kind of annoying when all of a sudden the adds started coming in at random times when my songs were on shuffle. Other than that it's a really good app, and I give it a thumbs up."
"on September 25, 2015","Ok cool, but why pay to get offline music?! I mean when I got it I thought&#34;COOl A OFFLINE MUSIC APP!&#34; Ok let &#34;free at least 2 months&#34; offline music,then 5 🌟's. ok? Thanks."
"on May 8, 2016","I love spotify, but for the past couple weeks nothing will play. If spotify fixes this then I will rate the app five stars but until then I give it two stars."
"on May 17, 2016","My favorite go to app for music, if you want ad free, premium is the way to go and the offline mode is great when out and about no internet needed to enjoy."
"on September 20, 2016","I absolutely love spotify!!! There is nothing out there like it! All my music in one place. #MusicLover #Loyal Customer!😁😁😁"
"on April 1, 2016","This app is awesome and stupid BC you can't listen offline😦poo!!! But theres billions of songs and eyou can listen when your playing games or if your tablet is off."
"on July 21, 2016","Now, when I first got the app about two years ago or so, it was a different app. You could listen to the songs you wanted and save them to listen to later, and listen to whatever, as long as you had WiFi (unless you had premium), and listen to sponsored apps every handful of songs. It was great.  Now days, ads cut off the ending of songs, it crashes, freezes up, and you really need a premium account if you want to do anything. It seems as though they are more desperate for money, and I get that. The thing is, 10 dollars is something a lot of people might not be able to pay, yet they want to listen to music too.  It's made me happy in the past, but lately it's just disappointing me."
"on November 30, 2016","I get to listen to 30 minutes of add free music after watching a short add. I recommend this app to everyone."
"on March 23, 2016","If you love music,you will love spotify..excellent way to tk your music wherever you go without the silly ads..about time they made an app that turns you into the dj!!!"
"on September 2, 2016","I've had Spotify a very long time, as these type of apps go. I don't like random playlists. I want to hear the songs I download."
"on November 8, 2017","I love what it has to offer but it will not let me go premium."
"on July 17, 2016","I am using it for long time and is the best, I never purchase a music CD again because all my music is here in Spotify, excellent application"
"on November 4, 2015","Very good quality music app! Love getting free music too...However, the premium package costs too much for me. I'm a college kid who can't afford spending $9/month. If it was $3, that would be awesome!"
"on January 31, 2016","This is a great app to listen to music on and for me it'd better then Pandora bc up can make your own playlists and choose what songs u want to listen too and I just luv it!!!!😍😍"
"on January 26, 2016","Not only can you have access to all the artists, albums and songs you love, you can also find new music; great stuff that might not be getting air play on your local radio stations."
"on February 11, 2015","One of my favorite music on demand apps. Lots of music . I just wish the music search was more like searching for a song on YouTube. Where you can type whatever lyrics you know and it matches. Spot iffy doesn't have this search tool on par yet with you tube ."
"on June 16, 2016","I love this I used to be a SoundCloud lover now I switched to Spotify and it is better than Pandora in my opinion. It would be no.1 but too much ads"
"on January 11, 2017","Good app for artist you love  Wish they would generate playlists with other similar artists though."
"on January 17, 2017","Spotify was unable to open the in-app settings due to it crashing every time I tried to use that feature"
"on January 21, 2017","I use spotify for about two years now. I love it, it's way better than Pandora ever thought about being!"
"on June 2, 2017","Excellent"
"on August 16, 2017","I love it"
"on September 29, 2017","THANK you"
"on August 24, 2017","I love it"
"on August 5, 2014","I have been able to find all my old and new favorite music on Spotify. I love the ability to find multiple versions of the same song from different albums, live concerts and different artists renditions. The ads are not too obnoxious on the free version, which makes this much better than Pandora IMHO."
"on September 12, 2015","Spotify was great until you need to get premium to listen to what ever song you wanted instead of the shuffle. It was my favorite app, but I have to resort to YouTube now to listen to whatever song I want to hear."
"on December 4, 2014","My favorite music app, sound quality is good, my choices of songs wonderful, including the Christmas music is what I want too hear, the only problem I have had that it deleted itself, I don't know why but it did, I downloaded and it came back, I hope it doesn't happen again."
"on July 13, 2016","Such a good app for the way I spend my time because of my hectic schedule.I can listen to my favorite songs whenever, wherever! Thanx spotify"
"on August 12, 2016","I'm really enjoying Spotify. I love it that you can choose specific artists to listen to.Save albums etc. It's my go to music app now."
"on June 10, 2017","Greatest music platform available."
"on March 20, 2017","Sometime the ads can be a glitch but besides that it's great!"
"on May 12, 2017","I really appreciate the ability to discover full albums of artist that I'm interested in."
"on February 25, 2016","I really like this app but I think that premium should be cheaper or free that way if someone doesn't have the money to pay nine dollars a month then they have to pay less."
"on July 4, 2017","It works great, but, you have to have WiFi for it to play music. Plz make it so you dont have to use WiFi."
"on January 29, 2015","I really like spotify and I think it is great. The UI is amazing and the quality of the music is really good. I also love the fact that students only have to pay 5 dollars a month instead of ten. This is a great app and I really enjoy listening to music on here."
"on February 21, 2017","Spotify is my favorite music app. The Discover Weekly play list keeps me constantly entertained and there is a playlist to suit each mood."
"on February 10, 2017","My love for Spotify is well apparent, it's the coolest app ever! Even the free version works very well."
"on February 20, 2017","Spotify is great! It has most of the songs you want to hear and you can make your own library of songs!"
"on January 13, 2017","imes it just randomly shuts off and I have to open the app again but couldcould just be from my kindle"
"on December 24, 2014","WOW! This is a rare thing too see. This app has every single song I like too listen to with few exceptions. Also new music comes in frequently. Its something you truely have to get to understand and apperciate how awesome it is. Also it is completely free of charge unless you go premium, which turns off ads and lets you listen offline. You can even listen to music as you read or play games or whatever you do on your mobile device. Way better than Pandora or other music services like that. User for 2 years 10/10 stars ---Official_Notbatman :D (Review made on 24 December 2014)"
"on October 29, 2014","I really didn't like searching through songs and albums to find the music that I like (Eagles, Doobie Bros. Boston, LED Zep., and etc.) to set up a play list. If I have to go to that length of time and listen to the commercials, I might just as well set up a playlist on my Kindle."
"on March 24, 2016","I want to hear a song so I find it and play it. I want to listen to an album, an artist, I find them and I hit play. So simple and a seemingly endless array of music."
"on February 11, 2016","Unless I missed an update, I wish the mobile version was not forced into shuffle. Some lists I like in order of initial song listing. Otherwise, I've been pleased with Spotify."
"on November 30, 2015","I love this app! I use it almost everyday. The only concern I have is that sometimes it'll quit working and uninstall itself from my device. Other than that the app is definitely worth getting."
"on April 4, 2016","Spotify is easy to use, and is always ready to show you a song they recommend. There are charts that show you different types of songs. I would get Spotify anytime."
"on July 27, 2017","Great platform, all the music I want and that I didn't even know I wanted."
"on April 26, 2017","spotify is amazing, u can even listen to music without using WiFi or data."
"on March 7, 2017","A wide variety of music for every taste, age, culture... Much much more!!!"
"on November 22, 2014","Ok so you know Taylor Swifts New album just came out and there are so many songs that I want to listen to on Spotify, and I go on her page and ALL of her music is gone besides the songs that she features in! Plz fix this!!! Plus cool down on the ads plz 1 ok but 3 seriously?!"
"on July 30, 2017","Spotify is great. It has all the music I listen to and more!"
"on March 9, 2017","I love the fact that spotify has a huge collection of songs."
"on June 12, 2017","Its a solid music app. The selection stays up.. Thanks Spotify, keep up the good work."
"on October 25, 2015","I am loving this app. Able to enjoy all of my favorite music anytime I want. They have all my oldies,but goodies my gospel, my R&B, right at my fingertips. The premium package is worth every penny."
"on August 15, 2016","I was looking for an app that had all my Gospel music..Happy to say Spotify delivered...Excellent song choices and easy to navigate."
"on January 30, 2016","Love the spotify service and selection, but the app is probably the only one that consistently crashes on my mobile and desktop platforms. Recommend changing your developer team!"
"on December 19, 2016","best music app. great selection of music"
"on January 17, 2017","Spoitify changed the way I listen to and explore music. I need food, air, shelter and Spotify to live."
"on January 3, 2017","Such a good music app! I can literally find anything!! Paying for premium does give you more though 😁"
"on January 17, 2016","Yo I love linken park so I got this and oh man this is the best app ever because its free but the adds only bother for in e minute then it leave yoyu alone for thirty minute🐨👍👍😂"
"on August 14, 2016","If I could discrbe this app is one word it would be Yassss some people wonder if Spotify premium is worth it but it is trust be.☺☺☺☺"
"on December 29, 2015","I really like this app! Unlike other apps you can listen to music by your favorite artist exclusively. The ability to create multiple playlists of your choice is an added bonus as well."
"on August 6, 2014","I've used a lot of music apps - Pandora, iHeart Radio, Tune in, etc. - but never one with such amazing search speed, ease of use, and nearly instantaneous playback. Old, new, even rare, obscure music --this app has found every single one I searched for and started playing it in only a few seconds."
"on December 12, 2015","I recommend this because it is great for researching on the web and listening to music in one device instead of using other technology for one and having to use another device for the other"
"on April 7, 2016","I love this app! The song selection has just about every song from at least the last century, probably longer! I love Spotify and I have it for all of my devices!"
"on June 15, 2016","Really enjoying it"
"on March 5, 2016","has the radio like Pandora, BUT, you can have your own music to listen to offline, with one exception, you have to pay $1 for it, but it's well worth it 5 stars for sure"
"on July 25, 2016","It is so nice to not have to listen to it as a radio, like Pandora and Google Play Music. Instead, listen to whatever the heck you want."
"on July 9, 2017","Total Awesome Music"
"on April 28, 2017","My son likes it but without add!"
"on April 26, 2017","Had Pandora for the longest time and everything about Spotify blows it out of the water"
"on May 2, 2017","This is an awzome free music app! I would recommend iit to anyone who listens to music."
"on April 16, 2017","I love it! It has all the songs(except for a couple but its okay.) It even has remixes!"
"on December 27, 2014","I loved it because it gave me various types of music I could listen to, but I was kind of disappointed that you can not listen to them without internet on the road for free you must pay. But otherwise it has good quality, but it may not give you all the recent songs."
"on October 12, 2015","This is great for long car rides or when your on an air plane. Its awesome for music for parties or just listening to music in general. It has so many viriaties of music. Keep up the good work 😸😁😁😁😁"
"on November 14, 2015","It's a great app with a lot of great songs, but my main problem is when it says “and now the next 30 mins of music are ad-free thanks to the following sponsor&#34;, it never loafs the ad lately."
"on May 9, 2016","The app would get 5 stars if the music was able to be stored on the SD card on my kindle. Instead the music takes up precious room on the main hard drive."
"on February 20, 2017","Crushes the competition. Simply the best music streaming app out there.  Move over Pandora."
"on January 4, 2017","I've been using Spotify for years and it was awesome to start and continues to improve! Very pleased."
"on April 2, 2015","Is it just me or has anyone else notice that the ads are getting worse? Because ever since i updated it I get 3 to 4 ads in a row and if i leave the app instead of watching the video my spotify app gets all froze and i can't do crap to unfreeze it"
"on August 14, 2014","We love this app. It is very easy to use and the music selections are great. So far the software is very stable and fast."
"on March 14, 2016","I really like how the adds are really short. It allows for a short break from the music, and them to get their quota without taking away from the experiance"
"on April 21, 2017","This is a great app, and functions perfectly."
"on December 9, 2015","This was a good music app but the problem was I couldn't download anything so I couldn't listen to music on the road. Also, I can't pick my music from my music list. I have to shuffle them."
"on June 11, 2016","I love this app. It has every song that i search for. I only wish that you wouldn't have to listen to so many ads without having to to go premium."
"on September 12, 2016","Still getting used to it, but so far so good. Wish it was easier to select the songs you want, but it's not a hassle either."
"on September 8, 2014","You don't need to pay. You can choose songs or radio stations:) Best app ever literally!!!"
"on March 17, 2016","Does what it's supposed to"
"on October 31, 2015","I used to be addicted to Pandora, but Spotify has taken its place. Amazon music is still the best (lyrics easily available), but I love being able to listen to an entire album before I purchase it."
"on March 21, 2016","Won't let me upgrade to premium on kindle."
"on November 30, 2016","Spotify is awesome you can listen to any music you want get this app I will say it again get this app😁😁"
"on October 2, 2016","Useful, easy, clean. Pretty much any song I have searched for is here. Lock screen UI is streamlined. I enjoy it a lot."
"on March 3, 2015","It's a very excellent app! No bugs (so far). But I was wondering what happens when your trial ends... Do you have to pay? Or is there just more adds (I can deal with adds). I would appreciate if you answer my question. Thanks again for this awesome app!"
"on July 13, 2017","Bring back lyrics!"
"on October 2, 2017","Its amazing get it"

"on April 29, 2017","I love 💘 this app it is the best one that plays 🎶🎶!!!!!"
"on July 18, 2017","Works well. can make own play list and turn my screen off."
"on January 27, 2015","I put several songs on a playlist and wanted to listen to them. When I tapped on them It wouldn't let me. I hit shuffle play and it played a song that I didn't know and wasnt on my playlist. The reason I put 3 stars on here is bc they have so much music"
"on February 6, 2017","Best music app on the market, and perfectly alright without paying for premium(though that's cheap)."
"on January 25, 2016","I love spotafy its great!! Everything from the music to the station's!!!! I had no clue about this until I got Appstore ceres! And u should get it!! Really its awesome!! So cool"
"on December 5, 2015","Does not work offline, does not let you download music to listen to later. It has a great many choices to listen to though if you have consistent wireless links and aren't offline that much"
"on March 7, 2016","Music from all genres and songs that are difficult to find in other platforms. My only questioning is for songs that appear listed but they don't play for some reason."
"on February 22, 2016","I love Spotify. Huge selection of music to choose from. Easy to navigate. More affordable than paying for each song. Works great. I use it on my tablet and desk top."
"on August 4, 2014","I love spotify, but you shouldn't have to pay for anything on it. Like downloading music so you can listen offline. Why not just switch to pandora? Even though spotify is good, it only deserves three stars. It could earn five stars from me if it would only let me listen to music offline for free."
"on January 22, 2016","Spotify is amazing! You can create your own playlist. OR listen to your favorite artist or album.Although I think even non premium members should get unlimited skips. Thank you."
"on March 8, 2016","Love this app it has all the music that I like so far and I have not been disappointed yet if you want to here great music online or off then this is the app for you."

"on September 10, 2015","Spotify makes my day better. I get told Spotify is not as good as Pandora, but I stand by it every step of the way. I love listening to it when I am working, and reading, and gaming. Spotify is in my life most of my day!!"
"on December 3, 2016","I can't get in to Spotify with my first Facebook account : john.mckenzie44@yahoo.com and its hurting me"
"on September 24, 2014","I was addicted to Pandora and failed to see why I should switch to Spotify. Finally, I decided to try it out... and I'm blown away. Spotify offers so much more. More music, more customization, more options. Spotify is excellent."
"on December 22, 2016","The search feature and play controls are very clear and easy to use. Would definitely recommend it."
"on May 21, 2016","I really like Spotify, great music, but every time I play it on my TV,through the Internet it stops after about four songs,then I have to start over."
"on October 22, 2014","Just started using this app and so far I'm enjoying it. There is a lot of choices. I've even used the sleep section when I went to bed. It does have to timer so you don't have to worry about it staying on all night. I like that I can listen while doing other things on my kindle."
"on June 15, 2016","Get it, you won't be disappointed. Great way to find out about new music, then go BUY it so the band's you like can keep doing what they do!!!"

"on September 10, 2015","If this is your first time, then congratulations you now have downloaded the last music app you will ever have to."
"on March 27, 2015","I have Nuance Dragon Assistant (version 3.1.30.7) installed on my Windows 8.1 PC. Dragon Assistant gives you the freedom to use your voice to control or get answers from your computer and can stream millions of songs for free through the Spotify desktop application. If you have Spotify Premium, Dragon can also learn your Spotify playlists and starred items. That's what got me try Spotify and to eventually upgrade to Spotify Premium.  I have become a big fan of Spotify Premium. It has simplified my life - no more need for buying music or trying to get copies of my music library installed on multiple devices and platforms. I have this Spotify app installed on both my Kindle Fire HD and HDX. It works great on both devices. I also have Spotify Connect installed on my Fire TV and stream from this Spotify app."
"on January 10, 2015","Every since a friend recommended this to me, I have enjoyed listening to all the music that I have both found and newly discovered. Although, occasionally, I can not find a tune, 90% of the time I can. Thank you Spotify. Only problem- time runs away from you!"

"on November 2, 2015","On the Apple version, you get to play any music whenever you want without premium. As a drummer, I need to be able to play specific songs. Don't hate Amazon users, let them have truly free music."

"on February 22, 2016","I like Spotify a lot. I probably would give it 5 stars if I had the premium addition. I can find all kinds a music except maybe King Crimson. What's the deal with that?"
"on July 20, 2015","I can keep on listen to my music without have to listen my brother's. I can delete song I that I don't want. It works on my kindle fire HD. I can also go out of the app and my games and I can still listen to my music."
"on January 13, 2015","Way better than every music app I've ever tried. You can specifically pick a song from an artist or their album and listen to it which is my favorite part. You can also factories songs and put them in your own created playlist. And many other awesome features"
"on March 4, 2017","Soo good!💯💯💯💯🔥💯🔥💯💯💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥"

"on February 8, 2015","I absolutely LOVE spotify. The free version is good but the premium is amazing, best 10 bucks a month i ever spent. Totally worth it.

"on August 10, 2014","Better than the ""former"" Mog in that the streaming quality is better. I do wish that you could ""blend-play"" between the artist you select and similar artists (maybe you can- I just haven't figured out how). Also, I'm sure that Spotify's archive will get bigger as time goes on."
"on March 7, 2016","If You like hearing music you should get this app has all the songs i looked for and in great quality has mostly all new music its just the best music app ive ussed"
"on May 11, 2015","I love Spotify. Even when you don't by Premium, which is still a great deal, seeing as how its pretty cheep, its still a wonderful app. Especially since it doesn't download onto your device, so it doesn't take up memory on the device."
"on March 3, 2016","Its great that you can choose which songs u hear but for my kindle fire it won't let me upgrade for premium which made me mad otherwise great app better than pandora"

"on November 25, 2014","Ok since my mom had it, I wanted to try it. Because I love music. And I don't have a phone, so I could only use my kindle. When I got it I was amazed of all the songs, the quality, and how much stuff you can do. So I have alot of songs. Follow me~ DustyBox <3"

"on April 20, 2017","This app offers you a huge selection of music for all tastes, but if you don't have the premium account you have ads. Whenever the ads come on they either get stuck and I have to press pause which means I have to get up or out of the shower and take care of it. Or the ad video gets stuck and the time keeps going and once the time runs out everything stops and the only way I've figured out to fix it is by deleting the app, downloading it again, and logging back in. This may not seem like a big deal but it frequently is happening now which is making it a huge inconvenience for me."
"on December 15, 2015","This music app is amazing. Look up any song you want. And everything is free! I love this app. I have no problems with it. I request that if you want a good music app get this."

"on March 12, 2017","I would like it better if premium was available to everyone"
"on June 26, 2014","You get the radio stations pandora has, BUT you can pick your own music. The real bonus is you can download music to listen to offline. Awesome if you're taking a road trip or going on an airplane. You only need to login once every 30 days to referesh the license.  Also, spotify automatically pushes the songs to all the devices you have the app installed on. I have it on my kindle, my phone, and two desktops. When I add a song, it shows up everywhere."

"on October 7, 2017","It is a very good app but wish u could listion in the car with out cord"
"on March 17, 2015","Works most of the time, but could be much better. Any time I have used Spotify since its beta, I can't help but think that it is designed to keep you from its main purpose; listening to music. Finding artists albums and songs are easy enough, but listening to the music is frequently interrupted with adverstisements (much more often than like services such as Pandora). The music also stops playing on many of my devices when in standby mode after a random amount of time for some reason. In my opinion it focuses too much on being easy and loses much of what I want from a music player in the process."
"on April 23, 2016","I'm only using the free version with commercials for now. I like that I can chose my fave artist in album or mixed in the same genre!"

"on May 23, 2017","Awesome app!"
"on March 25, 2017","Soooooo Good"
"on March 1, 2015","Installed on Kindle Fire HD6. On tablets, you are supposed to be able to play any song any time, but it is only allowing me to shuffle play my playlists. I though it was working right when I first installed it, but now I'm not sure."

"on August 28, 2014","Sooooo awesome other than premium that you can buy it completely free. And i hate mp3 players they always end up breaking and now i dont have to buy one and all the songs are free just wish they didnt have adds. But other than that i think this app is plain awesome."

"on August 22, 2015","Maybe i havent found it yet, but i would like a setting to sensor. I like fast and set for workout music. Never heard so many f-, n- words. Havent found that kid or work upbeat station yet."

"on June 16, 2016","Omg!!!! This app is amazing! Great songs! Easy to use! Recomand this app for everyone who wants a reliable music app!!!!"
"on May 25, 2016","Good app could listen forever but! On some devices you can only do shuffle play then this app is no fun you have been warned."
"on August 18, 2016","I'm not crazy that I must subscribe to avoid ads or download playlists. I wish they could just sell the playlists for downloading. Plus, the black background is hard on the eyes. Too bad there are no skins to switch to."
"on November 9, 2016","It's really great, I get to chose the music I want to listen to, I enjoy it very much!"
"on March 21, 2016","My new best friend"
"on September 11, 2015","I just wanted to listen to a certain song but I couldn't I had to put it on shuffle. I like shuffle but not when I just want to listen to a certain song. And I can't update to premium."
"on April 9, 2017","Great app to listen to radio songs or game music"
"on November 11, 2017","Always right at my fingertips. Easy to sort and move. Love it."
"on August 29, 2016","Was pretty excited to finally nut up for a paid music service after using standard Pandora free since it came out almost 10 years ago. I was attracted to Spotify for the offline playback, since I lIke listening to music while camping and traveling in the backcountry miles away from cell service. I started downloading all my favorite music, making playlists, and using the app right away. I was never in love with the radio, and browse functions, as they felt clunky and not very intuitive. But i was making my own playlists so that didnt bothet me too much. All was working well until it wasn't. First the radio and browse functions started working even more poorly and then not at all, then Spotify would freeze up, and I'd have to close the app occasionally and restary. Then Spotify would freeze my phone to where I would have to remove the battery to restart. Thankfully I can do that with my phone. It still works fairly well when its actually working, but it freezes too often. The soft buttons to navigate through the features are too close and mistakes can be made too easily for efficient ""party dj"" type playback. The stock radio stations have a ton of crappy filler music so you need to rely on making your own playlists, and I use the app out of service so I admittedly have hundreds of songs ""saved"" to my phone which may be causing the freezing, still unaccpetable. But that is only half of my gripe. Navigation is awkward and the app is in need of remodel. I think they employ millenials to put together playlists, I haven't found a decent one yet. I was truly excited for this app but sadly I most likely will cancel if things aren't improved."
"on February 12, 2016","I would like to see a music queue; a function to &#34;listen next,&#34; or to add to the queue. I otherwise like the interface of this app."
"on July 25, 2017","I like it so far..I like how u don't have to b online to listen to ur music."
"on September 22, 2015","this is a great app for music you just have to make sure that the artist is with them. one thing for them to work on though is for users to able to pick a song and play it whenever."
"on July 31, 2016","Love it! but wish you could download the Playlist and listen to it offline without having to pay for premium"
"on October 23, 2017","Great selection of musical genres."
"on May 30, 2017","No Wi-Fi needed for tons of music!"
"on September 22, 2015","Spotifys New update is not good at all. You can't play the song you want when you want you have certain amount of skips. It is starting to get like Pandora which is not good at all."
"on August 18, 2017","Love it"
"on January 4, 2015","5 Star because it's awesome, I can customize my playlists. Make new ones. I can add entire albums to a playlist then if a song comes on I dont like I can take it off of my list. True Customization is awesome and great selection of music!"
"on November 7, 2016","Spotify is good for listening to music and creating your own selection of music!!!!!!!"
"on June 17, 2016","I need a ton of music for variety and inspiration in my yoga class and Spotify gives me access to all the music I need!"

"on January 7, 2016","Not a bad app. Haven't experienced any problems so far, and there's plenty of good music offline, without having to pay for the app if you're cheap like me."

"on November 28, 2015","My only complaint is that sometimes my music will cut off when I use certain other apps. But that might just be my device, my other family members have a no trouble."
"on February 22, 2016","Well worth the money for premium. Sometimes a little buggy but overall pretty easy to use. Still some glaring omissions in the catalogue though."
"on December 2, 2015","I pay for Spotify Premium, so having access to so many songs AND being able to listen to my playlists offline through my phone and my kindle fire is just wonderful."
"on September 26, 2016","Only complaint is it takes forever downloading my sins which it says it always has to down load"
"on January 26, 2016","This is the most amazing app I've ever used. It gives me new playlists and show me new artists I'd like. Easy to use and so so necessary during my day!"

"on August 27, 2015","This app kids great. It doesn't install stuff on its own. I haven't experienced any ads. Of course I need Wi-Fi, which is a given. Definitely an upgrade from Pandora and iHeart Radio. :)"

"on February 9, 2017","I like what this App, Has to Do, See, & Play good Music & Who can use it!!!"
"on February 22, 2015","Whats more to say, Spotify is the greatest for finding new music to listen to. I find stuff on my desktop, purchase what I like or make playlists for my Fire tablet. I find stuff I can't find on Amazon, then will order the CD."
"on August 17, 2014","I would most definitely recommend this app it is amazing. It is even better than any other music app. You don't have to wait for it to load, the song just comes right on. WOW I am just so speech less I am laughing. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH"

"on September 12, 2016","The browse and search features help me find music other than what I was specifically looking for."
"on November 26, 2015","Sporting is really good! However, it recently got an update where you need premium to choose a song on mobile. That, in my opinion, is stupid. They NEED to fix that."
"on August 26, 2014","The only reason I don't give this app 5 stars is because I can't actually PICK a song on my playlist, I have to just let it go on shuffle. And, obviously, the ads.... but really, it is a great app,I love using it when I'm doing work and such... strongly recommend."
"on November 7, 2016","I really like it. The music isn't fair or watev.....yay...ice cream and peanut butter"

"on March 28, 2016","You can pick your own music and there are not many adds. But you have to download or get the premium version to listen to music offline."

"on June 27, 2016","This is the best when I am working out. It keeps playing the songs that I love! I would recommend this to everyone!"
"on September 9, 2015","Love everything but the data usage even when in offline mode. Comes with the territory of peer to peer sharing. Haven't found a song I wanted that they didn't have. Totally worth it."
"on December 2, 2014","I love this it has the abcs WITH NUMBERS you need this app it has all the troo troo train music you can get but it did disappoint me when I writ down a song and yelled out that it's real IT DID NOT HAVE IT! But all in all its so rad and funk"

"on October 20, 2016","Love it, keeps my old music safe .I know when I want to listen it will always be there."
"on November 17, 2014","Spotify has a large songs list. This is the best music app in my opinion. It is very simple to select or find a song. Music list are very useful as it offers a good selection according to day or preferences. Very simple its better. Recommended."

"on December 16, 2014","It's likes better than pandora. So I'm giving it a 5 star rating. It's cool because you can find the music you like instead of listening to songs you don't like come on without permission"

"on August 23, 2016","I like this found a lot of music from other countries that I couldn't get on my other music sources"
"on December 1, 2014","Just what I always wanted, Pandora with options. Now I don't have to go buy an entire album to see if it is good. I just wish that some artists wouldn't take there songs off of here and would live for the people, not just for themselves."

"on February 11, 2016","I am able to build my own custom playlist from all of the genres I enjoy! I can have one for exercising, relaxing, and riding on my motorcycle!"
"on July 31, 2014","If your like me and you have music in your veins instead of blood, get this app! Free skips, download anything you want and if you get premium for 9.99/month( a little too pricey:/) you can listen to your music without a connection! Definitely worth 15 stars!!"
"on November 8, 2015","Absolutely love this app! So much better than Pandora. You can actually search artists and songs and play individual songs and albums. Definitely worth the download"
"on December 20, 2016","So awesome all the songs I had to pay for I don't now thanks to spotafi"
"on December 12, 2015","Spotify is the best service available. Used MOG until Apple killed it through Beats. This is great.  So far this is the best experience I've had."
"on January 11, 2015","I love spotify!! They have all the new songs I want to listen to. I love that it lets you save songs you listened 2 so when your in the mood you can go back and listen to it. I also love that you can make playlist specific to you."

"on September 11, 2015","Words cannot describe how having access to all my favorite songs have improved my mood. By all means, if you may, get the premium version. Offline storage is definitely worth it."
"on December 19, 2015","Absolutely fantastic . easy to use and navigate. Few suggestions:  1. Based on the type and genre , suggest a list of songs 2. Preview mode"

"on November 7, 2014","Pretty good, better than the free iHeart app. Most times. LAMEST PART; THERE IS NOT ONE REAL TRUE BEATLES SONG, the only thing users have access to is knock off Beatles tribute bands and covers. Uber-lame. Get it cuz it's free though, I guess."

"on October 17, 2017","Love Spotify!"
"on February 25, 2015","Sweet Streaming station. Have always been a fan of Pandora and Slacker. Decided to hear for myself what the big fuss was over Spotify. Great selection of genre type music, but also allows you to make your own playlists."

"on November 22, 2014","It's been said before but this service is f-in amazing. I have five decades of music in my head and whatever I think of- is there. Music is our shared culture, it shouldn't be locked in a vault. It should be available for us to enjoy."
"on May 5, 2015","By far the best music companion you could wish for! The free version is okay but being a student getting the premium for $5 a month is totally worth it. Gives you the power to control music across devices that are on the same account via cellular connection or wifi. Downloading tracks are worth it for road trips or when you're out of the city! Lastly the music library in which you can pull from is always growing and is very solid! Oh and by the way it also syncs with your itunes library as well as shazam! So you get the best of all worlds!"
"on June 26, 2017","Great app!!!"
"on March 8, 2017","Everything I need it to be."

"on January 16, 2015","My music when I want it.....more personal than pandora . You can custom build your own playlist with hand picked songs that u want to hear or you can choose a pre built playlist. I highly recommend this over Pandora any day."

"on April 8, 2015","Better than apps that make stations for you based on an artist or song you like. This app lets you listen to all the songs and artists you really want to hear. Can't think of anything bad to say about that."
"on December 14, 2015","It's a great music app but unless you get premium, you can't listen to the exact song you want, unless you wait until you get to it after other songs."

"on November 26, 2016","Love it but its been kicking me out and not letting me listen to music"
"on October 5, 2015","Excellent app, at least with Spotify Prepmium. Without it, it is a little less great than Pandora, but I think Premium is worth it. All songs, right there on spotify."
"on January 6, 2015","Everything is great and all of that, but the only problem is that I can't listen to my playlist without Wi-Fi that is the only problem if I could listen to my playlist without using my data and my Wi-Fi that would be great.."

"on June 24, 2017","Love it!!"
"on November 1, 2014","So when I first got the app I was like, oh I'll just try it, but it will be like all the other ones. So I down load it an I'm like wow this works great!!! AND ITS FREE!!!! I would recommend this to anybody. Thanks for reading."
"on March 21, 2016","I would give it 5 but it has you watch an ad saying you'll get 30 minutes of ad free music then an ad hits two songs later. -_-"
"on March 28, 2017","I love it's the best app"
"on September 28, 2014","I saw the good reviews and decided to try it out, but I was disappointed. It doesn't allow you to search the music you want, and this is extremely disappointing because I'm into fanmade songs on YouTube, like songs by Joydreamer, Sirhamnet, etc."
"on February 19, 2015","Great app, free version is a must. Customize a playlist and play it on shuffle. Free version does require internet. Cons: paid version is too pricey IMO when compared to other sources like prime music or Pandora"
"on August 9, 2016","Easy to use, extensive library of songs, love that I can play my own playlist of favorite songs"
"on March 28, 2015","You can do shuffle play or just look up a song. You can also see what is popular and listen to that. There is also a browsing section that starts broad and narrows it down if you don't know what to listen to."
"on February 19, 2016","Great selection! I would choose this music app over Pandora, iTunes music, and a lot of other popular music app! Well worth the money!"
"on September 16, 2015","It was good until they updated it so now you have to pay to skip songs unlimeted! Now you can only do shuffle if you haven't played for the premium. Other wise I love it."
"on May 3, 2017","The way they shuffled the songs, its surprising!👌"
"on March 23, 2017","You can listen to what ever type of music you want"
"on March 14, 2017","It has almost every song in here from every singer"

"on December 5, 2016","I love having Spotify on my different devices. The choice is great."
"on November 10, 2014","The sound quality is amazing and there are countless songs, however if you don't have premium, the music is not available without WiFi. You can listen to it with WiFi but it becomes useless when WiFi is unavailable. Pretty good though."
"on May 27, 2016","I have been using Spotify since it was launched in the U.S. I am very happy with how they continue full improve the end user experience."
"on May 16, 2016","I really love this app but it sometimes glitches a little bit other than that the app is AMAZING I love it so much"

"on January 12, 2016","Had this for pc for a few years and it has always served its purpose well. Nearly have 17k songs in my list of music alone id say enough said."

"on October 12, 2015","Easy to use interface. One minor drawback is the inability to add artists to a station. The only way I 've found to do it is by creating a playlist."
"on July 6, 2014","Spotify is amazing I love it especially when I can use it when I travel. And it's doesn't only have music from many famous singers like beyonce ect. It also has music from my favourite youtubers like superwoman and kalin and Myles!!! I love it!!"

"on January 3, 2015","This app is great!!! Should've downloaded a longgggg time ago! I couldnt find anything as far as music until now. The BEST part is that once a song is played, its saved in the catch so you can listen offline!"
"on April 9, 2016","Great app! Plays everything that I want with limited commercials and allows me to replay a song that I like."
"on September 5, 2014","I enjoy the spotify app. It is easy to use and convenient. I use it when my daughter needs distracting or I want to listen to something for myself. I prefer this to pandora right now. It doesn't lag and close as much as pandora does."

"on October 3, 2016","Love Spotify on my desktop, so naturally it's great on My Kindle."
"on March 9, 2015","It's nice to have an app, but the web player seems to work better. Also, on the web I don't have ads due to spotify rewarding me for helping with bug fixes or being member since prebeta, or something. It wasn't really specified as to why I shouldn't have ads with my account, but I still get th on mobile app.  Another issue is that I can't find an option to use better sound quality when on WiFi. I get the crap audio on 4g eating up my data cap, but I have a nice phone and would like better quality music when it's viable through high-speed internet.  The app kinda sucks, and the web player still seems to be the best option across most platforms, but at least they thought of us Amazon users."
"on December 15, 2016","Love listening to a variety of music from Spotify!"

There have only been a few times in the past couple of years when I couldn't find a particular song, but the iTunes didn't have it either. I can listen to Spotify in the car, then come in the house and the same song is playing on my computer. If I want I can turn on my home stereo system and listen to my music throughout the house! I love Spotify and have been a fan for three years. I have a premium membership so pay $9.99 per month. With iTunes, I'd only be able to purchase one or two full albums per month! With Spotify my downloads are limitless!"
"on January 28, 2016","It's so perfect I can get any song for free! And there are a few ads but that's ok because it's free music that is awesome."

"on September 15, 2015","Absolutely love everything about Spotify...the best is the &#34;offline&#34; feature where you can hear anything you have on your saved items."
"on November 3, 2014","I love music of every genre, from the Jesus Music heydays in the 1970s and 80s to classical to American blues. Spotify gives me access legally to a massive range of my favorites and beyond. I have innumerable playlists, making them specific to any event in my home, or activity. For example, I have playlists for 32-minute workouts. I don't remember why, but it made sense at the time.  So to review this, readers need first to distinguish Spotify from the competition, like Pandora. Pandora has its place, but what Spotify allows me to do is choose individual songs (in general). I used to buy more music on iTunes, but no longer do. The only time I buy a CD now is when it is extremely local.  As far as the app is concerned, I use it on a Kindle Fire. Basically, it is one of the few Fire apps that works just as it does on my Android phone. I use the free version for now, without the paid subscription, so I still hear commercials, and, while using it on a mobile device, do not get to hear my playlists in the order in which I intended. I'll live. I'm happy I have this.  Anthony Trendl anthonytrendl.com"

"on March 26, 2016","The music is amazing  I really think you should get this game music app whatever you want to call it"
"on December 30, 2014","Mixed feeling about this one. Because I love Spotify. It's essentially all I listen to when I'm at the desktop so putting it on my tablet seemed a no-brainer. And when it worked it was great. The one thing that annoyed me about the app was, when you played a playlist that was small (Less than 17 songs?), it would start throwing in random songs, as though you'd created a radio station. Which, why? Why the hell would you do that? Occasionally I'll make a playlist with a single song because, well, that's how I roll, but I could not get them to play without the ""suggested"" songs popping up and I could not figure out a work-around. It was pretty disappointing. Other than that though, as far as functionality goes, it seemed fine. My problem was that after several weeks I tried to open it one day and got a message that there wasn't enough storage space on the tablet. Which was a dirty lie. The only thing I use my tablet for is listening to music and surfing porn and how much space does that take? But try as I might all I could get was an error message or a blank screen. In a fit of pique I deleted the app and then downloaded it again. And it was fine. Perfectly functional. For several days and then it did it again. I deleted, reinstalled, rocked out for a couple days and then, boom, same thing again. And after doing this a few times I just gave up and installed Pandora. Possibly the problem is me. Or my tablet, which is neither terribly expensive nor a big-name brand. Or the app could be tragically fatally flawed. I mean, who knows? Regardless though, it's still worth a try. Because when it works, Spotify beats pretty much anything else on the market."

"on April 10, 2017","Spotify is very good. Or I mean amazing but I can't update it. When I turned my updates on, it kept trying to update but it wouldn't. I would love it if I could be able to update it. Other then that it's a five star app and I'm greatly confused why there is less then three stars. Also, If more songs could be added on. Some songs I know are not on Spotify. Like ""Buy the Stars,"" by Marina and the Diamonds. Or maybe I'm not looking hard enough? Either way, it would be nice to have updates and more songs. But still, five stars to you creator's of Spotify!"

"on September 3, 2014","I grew up with a turntable, reel to reel tape and AM radio, then marveled when FM and cassette tapes rocked my world with improved sound and portability. CDs upped the ante. MP3s, portable digital players and satellite radio further extended content and quality. Then something wonderful happened and changed everything: enter Spotify. Spotify’s paid subscription delivers ad-free all you can eat music with every song you can think of and access to every genre old and new. Combine that with phenomenal quality and universal streaming access via any smart device – PC, smart TV, streaming media player, tablet and smartphone – and musical nirvana is mine. In practice, Spotify can be quite daunting. What genre, group, album or song would I like to listen to now or download to my device for later? Spotify makes answering this question easier with options for matching your mood or activity with playlists supplied by Spotify experts and other users as well as searching and browsing tools that deliver clear results with helpful, relevant recommendations. The Spotify experience plays out differently across each of my typical use cases – desktop PC with near-field monitor speakers, tablet with Bluetooth connection to living room home theater sound system and smartphone with Bluetooth connection to car stereo or wireless headphones – but each one delivers exceptional results. Frankly, exploring Spotify on a 24 inch desktop computer display and hearing the results on studio-quality monitors pointed at each ear is thrilling. This is where I can truly grasp even the finest musical nuances and how I can accurately judge Spotify’s streaming media as excellent. Spotify on my 8.9 inch Kindle HD adds a novel musical dimension to sitting on the living room couch or hanging in the kitchen with family and friends, enabling one and all to queue their favorites, contributing background or central focus for conversation. Handing the Bluetooth connected tablet to a newcomer often requires a few moments for instruction on finding and queueing tunes that benefit from my home theater’s surround sound with subwoofer speakers. Recently, I introduced a friend with a room-sized, wall to wall audio collection to Spotify, who said this tablet solution could, should and would replace his shelves and stacks with instant musical gratification. Smartphone Spotify brings an endless mobile musical mix to the gym and in the car. In both cases, I typically rely on a quick search for a favorite group or mood-matching playlist, then get moving. My Bluetooth headset’s controls make it easy to pause, skip or replay tunes playing on the Spotify app without touching my phone. On the road with my smartphone connected to the car stereo via Bluetooth, the Spotify app’s big Shuffle Play button makes moving past less desired tracks effortless while maintaining the spontaneity akin to broadcast radio. While all these options for consuming music are first rate, the most important service feature remains Spotify’s monumental breadth and scope. The collection offered by Spotify fulfills my dual desires for deep diving in my musical past as well as expanding my horizons."

I have NEVER paid for the upgrade or Premium Service of ANY APP before until now. I was lucky enough to get in on a 90 day free trial for Spotify over the holidays and like WOW!! In a few days, my free trial will end and I fully intend to subscribe to the paid Premium Service, not just for me, but my whole family. The free version needs to offer a little more freedom so people can really see how fantastic Spotify really is. If you do a free trial, anything less than a Premium subscription is just a tease and actually depressing."

"on April 27, 2016","Ha.... I'm NOT the one to be rating this app. I'm so bent on preserving cell phone battery power that I find it hard to sit back and enjoy the tunes. In fact I've only used the app once, the day it was downloaded. So far... I've only one band that I've clicked to follow. MUSE. The evening the app was downloaded into my phone I did enjoy the shuffling of the different MUSE songs. The few advertisements played through without me really noticing them. (SORRY Ad Agencies) So it's just kinda like a radio station that plays only one group. hahaha. Though, I'm sure that will change as soon as more groups are listed in my favorites.  There wasn't any stuttering effect or pauses due to band width issues. And sounded pretty good with earphones on. So with my limited knowledge of these things, take this 5 star rating with a grain of salt."

"on January 27, 2016","Spotify blows all the other music streaming apps completely out of the water. With the free version you can listen to a particular artist or genre without having to listen to the recommended songs like on other apps.However, if you subscribe to the premium service you can listen to what you want, when you want and not what they think you will like, no commercials or ads. I am able to listen to anything past or present, I have yet to search an artist that they don't have, believe me, I have tried. If you like going to concerts, Spotify will keep you updated on upcoming concerts near you. I've tried all the rest but since I found Spotify, I'm not going anywhere."

"on April 8, 2015","If it didn't cost so much on your mobile it would be the greatest, they should charge maybe $5-10 a month, but on your tablet it's awesome"

"on September 9, 2015","If you want to get this app, there are a few important things to know: 1.The last I checked, they do not have Taylor Swift songs, so I'm really sorry for all those Taylor Swift fans out there! I was also disappointed with that. 2. You can't play individual songs. Ok so this is how it works, you search a song and you can add it. That song you can now out in a playlist. A playlist is just where you can categorize songs. And when you see the list of all your songs, you can't just play one. You must shuffle play. I WAS REALLY UPSET WITH THIS!! RREEAALLY UPSET! 3. They don't have all songs, but they do have most. 4. I JUST WISH YOU DONT HAVE TO SHUFFLE PPLLAAYY! 5. There is way more to Spotify, like radio and stations and things like that THANKS FOR READING I HOPE YOU CAN EASILY MAKE YOUR DECISION (I hope Spotify reads this and fixes the shuffle play problem. I'm sorry Taylor Swift fans, I don't think Taylor Swift allows Spotify to use her songs, it's a money /business issue.  -thank you-"

I personally don't have premium, but I still use my Spotify at least and hour a day. You can get everything from the original, to remixes, to the live versions of a ton of songs. I have everything from 1D to for King and Country! I love Spotify and think it is epic! Once I got my Spotify, I quit Pandora and eventually deleted the app. Spotify is amazing and I would definitely recommend getting it!!!"

"on August 5, 2016","Awesome but a lot of ads"
"on November 3, 2015","Spotify has changed my life! As a dancer and dj, I have over 100,000 titles on my hard drive, but almost all of them can be found on Spotify as well, and streamed in high definition. They can also be played offline on my laptop so I can take my playlist to any location, whether it has wifi or not. I can share the playlists publicly to my dancers and fellow dj's. I can add to my Local Files the albums it does not have, as long as I have them in my collection on the given computer or network, or purchase them elsewhere. It is user friendly and cost efficient. The artists get paid by the use of their music, per play, which seems fair-ish, at 7/10 of a cent per play: great if you are a superstar, not so great if you are a budding artist, but, hey, I can FIND budding artists on Spotify that I never would never know about if it weren't for their similar artist and radio functions, so all is fair and ethical, as far as I can see. Those artists that stand the test of time get paid ultimately more than those that are a flash in the pan. Hat's off to Spotify!"
"on February 16, 2016","I've never ever had a problem w Spotify like I have other apps"

"on September 16, 2015","Really enjoy this great app. Much better than the &#34;other&#34; music apps"
"on December 6, 2015","I must begin by saying I am your avid music junkie! If one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment I'd be infamous by now.  I began using Spotify per word of mouth when I was overheard verbally destroying Pandora. I paid for whatever Pandora markets their non free service as. It was a waste of hope and money. After a few skips (mind you these skips are more than a free Pandora user) I ran into the same skip limit as if I didn't shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips. The tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot. Nearing the end Spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what I heard I thought GREAT!, and I gave it a shot!  GREAT; because now I have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely, no fuss or gimmicks (this is with Premium, after the fail of Pandora free and paid services, I figured I'd start from the top with Spotify and see if slopes or avalanches downhill) and to me that was BLISS! With a wide variety of music I cannot live without daily ranging from Acoustic UK Pop Bands, to Old School Hip Hop KINGS such as KRS-One, Audio Two, and the legendary Wu-Tang Clan to our Modern Day (I Guess This Is What We Call) Rap Music, to my rock band faves like AFi and Blink 182, to Beyonce and Katy Perry for the softer Pop Music feel for the kids ears and Reggae and 60's & 70's KINGS and Queens of Soul Music, I can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and I LOVE THAT! I even have French rappers and singers songs, Idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention. That's what made Spotify so GREAT to me I have exactly 20 Playlists with over 1700 songs, and I created all the playlists to my liking and ALL available offline for my enjoyment anywhere. I can skip endlessy, I can jump to another playlist whenever I feel the desire and that's how music should be enjoyed! So why the Ehh?...  Ehh; with all the above praise that I will not recant, in fact I can ad more to it, there is a bummer to Spotify. Unbeknownst to me, the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory. Being that at that time I had the app installed on both my iPod and iPhone I never paid attention to it. But after tossing the Pod I noticed with my iPhone that Spotify was using up 4.5 GBs of the allotted 6.3 GBs. There weren't enough photos, games, and apps to remove to clear up space. My resolve was to purchase a tablet I know that has external storage per MicroSD cards. I ended up with the Kindle Fire HDX 8 8 GB and purchased the 32 GB MicroSD card. My plan was to download Spotify move it to the MicroSD and never have to worry about external storage and Spotify clashing again. To my greatest disappointment and I mean grave disappointment at this point, it turned out that SPOTIFY CANNOT BE MOVED TO MY 32 GB MicroSD card! It was infuriating to be casual at the least ok.  Resentment; Spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is! If you cannot afford Premium the app is useless, and that's just based off the experiences I've read over on reviews from Mobile App users. If you do have Premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up. If I only knew Spotify unlike let's say Netflix, cannot be moved to the MicroSD card from my HDX 8 I probably would've gotten a bigger Kindle (external memory wise). What really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after Amazon's preinstalled entities we consumers of the HDX 8 8 GB start off with a mere 5.3 GB!  So how does one cope with the ups and downs of Spotify and external memory clashes? You grab your headphones, scroll your favorite Playlists you created, skip and scroll through your music freely, and be thankful! Why? Because it could always be worse.. (coughs) Pandora (coughs). In writing this review I see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes, may have lead to adverse feelings towards Spotify. But I do have to say this it is a superb application. I have it on my iPhone for on the go, for the home depends on where at home, it can be either the XBOX, the Smart TV, and now the HDX 8. You can't really beat or put a price on that, Spotify however did and it's only $12.99/month. What's that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? Yea I'll pass and will continue to pass the word on about Spotify. Hope you found this helpful, you will enjoy Spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor, Premium is the ONLY way to really get a full grasp on the application and it's features. If you claim to love music you NEED Spotify Premium you can't go wrong."

And may I recommend Vitamin String Quartet, they have HUNDREDS of songs from all genres, all played by a string quartet....for those times at work when you want to rock out to The Foo Fighters, but have to be in a professional setting, Vitamin String Quartet can fill your musical needs! Spotify is my favorite music app of all time! I am the DJ!"

"on January 7, 2016","It's great, but you should create clock alarm with music."
"on January 10, 2016","I subscribe to Spotify premium and I got this app for our Fire TV stick. It was a little misleading though as I thought it was a full app for the TV. I expected it to work much like the app on my tablet or phone where you can see the playlists and all that right within the app. But how this works is that you play your music on another device like your phone or desktop and you can broadcast it over your TV. It works, but I don't like that I need to use a 2nd device to change the songs, etc. Also, sometimes the connection isn't stable even when the internet connection is perfect. For the most part it's ok, but I think app could use some work.  I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews! If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a ""Yes"" vote on my review!"
"on March 13, 2015","No real complaints, love the app!! Much better with a subscription though. Most songs and albums are at your finger tip!!"

"on July 30, 2014","Great song selection. Easy play lists. Easy to share. I don't have a bad thing to say. I have read a couple things here that are simply untrue or out dated. You can play ANY song from your play lists, turn your device to wide screen and you will see the song list. If you would like to listen to your purchased music, use a different app, this is a steaming music service. Couldn't be happier. Unless Spotify breaks itself or goes bankrupt, no more Pandora."

"on February 16, 2016","I love this app but it won't open on my Kindle"
"on September 15, 2014","better than pandora by far"
"on September 11, 2015","It's a simple app but it would be better if you could go off line without premium"
"on February 13, 2015","So far so good has all the newest music plays clearly and is free the upgrade price isn't bad either...Will keep you posted"

"on September 22, 2014","As others have stated, there is nothing wrong with this app and with Spotify itself. My only fault with it is that I waited too long to sign up for it."

"on August 25, 2015","Streaming music is so fast on Spotify. Beats Google music or any of them. It downloads on kindles, androids, iPhones, and other devices. Except Xbox. Which sucks but oh well. I love this app. You pay 9 dollars a month but it's sonworth it. All new music is right on there and you can make playlist. As many as you want. It's so amazing. I love Spotify.

"on November 8, 2014","One of my FAVORITES ! Oh, I can't get enough of this one ! So much MUSIC, How can I find the time to play it ! westshirley43@yahoo.com"
"on November 19, 2014","I first downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation and it worked perfectly. It let me create my own playlists with only my own hand-selected songs and it let me skip as often as I wanted and select whichever song I wanted with only a 30 second commercial interruption every 4 or 5 songs. When I went to install the app on my new 4th generation Kindle Fire HD, Amazon popped up with a message saying that the current version of the app is not compatible, but they have contacted the manufacturer and asked them to correct the problem. When this app works, it's absolutely awesome. For once, Amazon isn't to blame for this because it IS compatible with a lot of devices. I read a lot of complaints about this, but if people are dumb enough to give their credit card info to a company that auto charges after a free trial before they're even sure that the app works, then they shouldn't complain. Spotify gives you a 7-day free trial of their premium service with no credit card info needed. You only have to provide your credit card info when you sign up for the additional 30-day free trial, then it automatically charges you. People should know if this is compatible before they provide that info. Bottom line - it's an awesome app that needs to get its compatibility issues sorted out because it's one of the best music apps out there. There are tons of pre-made playlists, and more importantly - you don't have to listen to a whole lot of music that you don't want to like most radio apps. And though you have to be online and have occasional commercials for the free version, it's still worth it. The premium version is $9.99 a month and you can download songs so you can listen offline and have no ads. Still not a bad price considering all the songs you can get if you want to pay for it.  UPDATE----- Spotify has fixed their compatibility issues with the Kindle Fire 4th generation and the app is working perfectly for me again."

"on November 11, 2014","I would happily say that this app is EXTRAORDINARY it has everything u want and need in music Pros: All the music you LOVE Every single artist ever known (even if they aren't good) Make your own playlists Listen to whatever you want It awesome Keeps u updated on the new songs  Cons: You need premium to listen instead of shuffle play Explicit content (for all u kids out there....what would your parents think)  I recommend this app for everyone they has a kindle and you should download it NO CHARGE!!!"
"on August 14, 2014","I use this on a daily basis. The sound quality is great (not excellent, but still a nice quality sound for most songs). There are very few songs I have not been able to find on Spotify, and I suspect that has something to do with the individual artists' licensing agreements. Unlike other music services, I don't have to listen to any songs I don't want to, and when using the non-mobile version, there are no limits to the number of times I can skip songs. I merely have to listen to a short (around 30 seconds) advertisement after a number of skips and after listening to a number of songs.  The drawbacks are that some songs are not available, and you are limited to the number of skips in an hour on the free version of the mobile app. If you want to use the mobile app, you are better off paying for the membership due to the limits on what is available to listen to on a mobile device, and that even includes iPads and tablets. Still, if you are using a laptop or desktop, it is probably the best free music app available at this time, and you can't beat the price."

"on September 15, 2014","Very great source for music and programming to listen to while you're at home or on the go. I do recommend that you use this only at home since it might run up your limited data plan. The sound quality is above CD quality and the service has a very good library. It beats filling up your phone with songs and ending up running out of space. Spotify does not have everything and sometimes they limit what you can listen to based where you are located because of those copyrights. I have the premium subscription because I hate the commercials in the middle of the listening sessions."

I don't think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app. It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well. Since it is Christmas time, it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums. Very nice. Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now. One thing I don't understand is how this service is available for free. It does have a few commercials, VERY few. It just doesn't make any sense to me, but I'm not complaining. Really nice service or app or whatever you call it. I think it's great!!!"

"on March 1, 2016","Awesome, why didn't I find this sooner."
"on April 23, 2016","Spotify is a great app for listening to your favorite songs. Being able tomake playlists that have songs you already like gives it a slight edge over Pandora. Since both are free and use ads to allow yoyu to not have subscription it really comes down to whether you feel knowing what songs are going to play versus getting introduced to new songs you might like. While Spotify does both, it doesn't really do the latter as often, where Pandora is entirely that. Really it comes down to personal preference and what you are looking for. If you want to know what is going to play based on a playlist you created go with Spotify, but if you want more of a radio deal go Pandora. Both have things they could improve on. Now as for both apps' premium upgrades Spotify, in my opinion, has more bang for your buck. You have the ability to skip and amount of songs,peak and see what is up next, have no ads, and download songs or playlists to your device for offline listening. This means you don't have to have signal nor do you have to use so much data. In my own opinion Spotify and Pandora are great apps for the type of music provider they are. Honestly if you can't choose between them, get both! If you already do and what to go premium on one go with Spotify, because it offers more in my opinion, although it is more expensive than Pandora."

"on June 24, 2017","Good app, lots of music. The ""Premium"" package seems to be a bit pricey, however. At $10 a month, it seems a little steep. Could it be that most people take the free version, so there aren't enough Premium contracts to pay the nut? I'm not an audiophile, so $10 is too rich for my blood."

"on October 29, 2014","This app is amazing. I'm disappointed that I used Pandora and SoundCloud when I could've been using Spotify. You can look up any artist, song, or album, and Spotify will probably have it. There's rarely any adds, and you can save whichever music you like to your personal library. The only downfall is that you need wifi to be able to use it, but if you get premium, you can listen to your personal music whenever, wherever. Overall, it's a great app."

Like every time I attempt to play a certain album or band or whatever, I click on that ""Play List"" & I can't get what I want; it plays the ""RADIO"" it sets up for you.

The music selection is unbelievable, lots of the music I love, many pretty obscure artists I love but didn't find elsewhere (and even some obscure novelty items I never thought I'd hear again). Their system of choosing the music I want to hear, how and when I want to hear it, works really well for me too. The ads are a little abrupt; I might try the $ option, but that's my only complaint (..maybe I can get used to it)."

"on March 2, 2016","I love that amazon has apps to download. The apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"
