3/15/2014,I use to love this app and then it updated and I keep having issues with it. When I am playing offline it keeps stopping and telling me it can't connect to the internet.

It makes it so easy to exercise or walk with, and yet I can relax and read to the music also. The different groups, such as amazon music for walking, update constantly, and I do not have to go to the web site to do it. Makes listening to the music fantastic. My only problem with this is that I can access movies while travelling outside of the US, but not the music, You have to download it. Hurry up and get the musical access also!",amazon

5/8/2015,"*** It should be noted that I wrote this review before Amazon converted this app to the ""cloud player"" so even though this app has the same name as the current one, there may be significant changes in how it works now. ***
 
 You can search, listen to samples, and buy songs with this app. However, there are no user controllable settings and it gives VERY little information about the song or the album while shopping. You also must sync this to your amazon shopping account and enable one-click purchases to make it work.
 
 This is a very basic app, which is a good thing to some degree... that's what keeps it simple. I'm glad it's not trying to be everything under one roof. I don't want it to be a music player and do all sorts of other annoying stuff like iTunes does. However, it is so limited that it's hard to feel like it's easy to use because the limitations require other work-arounds.
 
 ~~~Shopping Experience:~~~
 
 When shopping for songs or albums, there's no description, reviews, or anything else other than the artist, title, and a date (which is not explained--is that the release date or what?).
 
 Being able to listen to song samples so easily is a very nice feature. It's quite easy to search for a song, quickly find it, and listen to a sample before buying. It's great if you're not sure what song you're lookaying for.
 
 There are some strange things about it though. For example, several songs and albums I searched for have two versions of the same song for two different prices. Songs from the same name, artist, and album sometimes show up as two separate listings for $.99 and $.89 with no explanation of the difference. Are they different bit rates or something? Different formats? With no explanation available and no extra detail about the song... who knows what you're getting.
 
 There seems to be no way to put songs in a cart and buy them all in a single purchase. You must activate one-click on your amazon account to use this app. I just started using it so I haven't seen the credit card bill yet, but the way this works makes it seem as though there's going to be a separate $.99 charge on the card for every individual song you buy. This seems a little tedious. I would love to buy several songs at once in a single transaction.
 
 It would also be nice to buy up a credit balance for the phone like a gift card so I could just purchase songs as I discover them and have the cost deducted from my balance without paying for each separately. I don't want to have to share that with my other amazon web shopping however, so I'm not sure if a traditional Amazon gift card would work. It's all pretty poorly explained. If I were going to use this app a lot I would be tempted to create a new amazon account specifically for this app so I wouldn't have to commingle settings with my web shopping.
 
 Also, there seems to be no way to retrieve previously-purchased songs later on if they get lost or deleted. It would be really nice if it would put the song in a queue to download next time you sign in from your computer so you can easily use it there too. Currently I copy them from my phone to the computer... so why not just buy them on the computer and copy them to the phone? That's not any harder or easier so it contributes to my point that while the app is easy in itself, it requires a bunch of extra work to get the full value out of your music purchase thereby negating the so-called convenience of the apps simplicity.
 
 ~~~App Experience:~~~
 
 Because there are no user controls, you can't specify what folder the songs get put into or where it is located. Neither of the music players on my phone are able to find the amazon mp3 folder on their own (even after refreshing the media list) and therefore are unable to show and play the new music. So I had to install a file manager app, and each time I buy a song I have to copy the it to my normal music folder.
 
 Finally, the documentation for this app sucks. Actually working the app itself is pretty easy and self-explanatory (mostly because it has no features other than searching for songs and pressing the buy button), but it requires a whole bunch of coordination with your amazon account and its settings and the implications of all the little things you do are not at all evident. Everything is very poorly explained, if at all. You have to fumble through all the steps until you figure things out on your own. Then for the few topics they offer help with, it's takes you to a web page for an explanation... but comically, it's not a mobile-friendly web page so you have to zoom in and scroll left and right to read the lines. Seriously? These are web pages written specifically relating to a mobile phone app, ostensibly to be read primarily on a mobile phone, yet they're not in a mobile friendly format. Big fail.
 
 ~~Summary:~~~
 
 As powerful a site as amazon.com is, I'm a little surprised at how incredibly basic this app is. The way it works now, I find it much easier to just buy the songs from the amazon web site with a computer, and transfer them to the phone manually. The only time I envision using this app is when I'm away from my computer and desperately want a song right away.",amazon

9/11/2016,"The Amazon Music App for Android use to be pretty cool. Recently I have found it to lock up after playing just one song and giving me an error #182. I use to love this app and streaming music that I purchased from Amazon. Since others are having this same issue, I am concerned that Amazon may have lost site of the need to play songs that I buy from them. I have sent many reports from the error screen. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted..you name it and I have done it. The install itself seems very glitch and not smooth like prior versions. All of this has been going on for a month.",amazon
11/24/2015,"Excellent, I love Gospel and this really help me through my day! I have not listen to nothing else yet.",amazon

11/6/2015,love all the options for sure,amazon
7/22/2016,"I was hoping that this Prime service would replace a lot of other services I was using through the Google Play market. At the time of this review, I am currently using a Prime membership trial. I was hoping that Prime membership could help me alleviate some other services by using it. For instance, I love Netflix but prime instant video seems to have everything I need. The free shipping options with Prime in the market also make it a good purchase decision. I use google play music now and for one flat rate I can listen to as many songs or albums from as many artists as I want without having to download or buy individual songs or albums and I can play and stream them directly from the Play service cloud. I can make as many playlists as I want too. When I checked through this Amazon music app, most of the music I wanted to listen to has to be purchased individually and most of the albums have to be done the same as well. I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on music. I will just stick with Google play music on this one. I believe they have it right. Still thinking of keeping Prime though. Just the shipping, Instant Video, and free bookay collection makes Prime worth it.",amazon

9/13/2015,"I love absolutely LOVE it because it's NOT i Tunes. I hate having to buy music threw a company that will only let me listen to it on their devices (without jumping threw hoops to download it).
 
 Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).
 
 Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.
 
 Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one. That also means no more, ""which device is that song on?""!
 
 I LOVE IT!",amazon

6/22/2015,"Wanted to love this, I really did. I love all things Amazon and the music selection and service with prime are good so I was excited to try the music unlimited. Unfortunately, the app itself skips constantly. I literally can't get through one single song without a skip. These are downloaded songs on TWO different phones, a Galaxy S3 and S5 so it's a streaming/connection issue either. App updates, cache clearing and restarts have not fixed it. It happens on both phones so it must be a problem with the app itself since it's the only faulty media experience on either. It makes the listening experience unbearable so I will be cancelling the free trial and lookaying elsewhere. It's a real shame they can't make this product work correctly.",amazon

9/6/2014,"I absolutely LOVE Amazon Music! As a PRIME member, I have access to a boatload of music that I can listen to at any time, for free!
 I can create my own playlists, or save some awesome playlists that have already been created by Amazon.
 If you can think of a genre, Amazon Music has it.
 
 True, you can't download songs, but if you want to do that, you should pay for those songs.
 
 I also love the fact that many of the songs have lyrics, so (unfortunately for my family), I can belt out tunes to almost any song.
 
 And if you have Fire TV...instant karaokaye! The lyrics appear on your tv! Love, love, love!",amazon

I like buying singles alot better than the whole album cause sometimes I only want one song.. Downloading is fast. Another great amazon product. I love amazon! I never shop anywhere else cause it has everything and at wonderful prices. Just recently joined Amazon Prime and since I do alot of shopping with Amazon the money I have saved as already paid for my yearly membership. Come on people 2 day shipping at no cost! What could be better. Should also say that if you lose your music you can always go to your amazon music and download it for free!",amazon
1/4/2014,Love the amazon mp3 idea. I put 12k of my mp3s into the cloud. This software needs more work ..getting there though ...,amazon
1/29/2012,"I love how it works and the ease of use, however it doesn't have the variety I would like to see. I am pleased with the service overall and my husband recently became a prime member just for prime music. I love that I can use it on any computer/tablet that I can log into my Amazon account on without having to download anything. There is a smartphone/tablet app that I use because it takes me to straight to prime music without going in though my account. I have had other music programs in the past that I couldn't use at work because they required me to download a program to use on my work computer. That is not the case here and I really like that.",amazon
7/15/2016,"Love Amazon. Absolutely love the new Prime Music. But why oh why can I not access music in my digital music library from my HTC phone like I used to before this new app tookay over? I shelled out $30 for the larger storage space and was enjoying it constantly until one day a bunch of my music was gone. Even worse, songs I've since imported into my cloud library and songs I've purchased from Amazon on my pc are not accessible on my HTC via the new app. Until this is fixed, Amazon has lost my digital download business. So sad.",amazon
7/5/2014,"Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums from the Prime library. I'm not sure if there is a way to download them onto my phone and play them through the app that way, but it's not a big deal.
 
 Reason I gave it four stars is due to layout and navigation. I should be able to click on the artist's name from any song and see all albums/songs by that artist. Also, sometimes the buttons get stuck below the display area of my phone (3.5"" phone). I also see that it runs a bit sluggish (1 ghz phone).
 
 Again, pretty good app and I'm happy with it. Hopefully we'll see some improvements and make this a truly outstanding app/service.",amazon
10/23/2014,"This crap will not install! Tried numerous times, read tons of reviews of others with the same problem. Amazon tech can't get it to work either. This app is junk and amazon prime delivery is terrible also, they're consistently late but they're late taking my hundred bucks. They blame it on the UPS, USPS AND OTHER CARRIERS. ALL THIS IS AMAZONS MISMANAGEMENT!!! Love to see Amazon bankrupt",amazon
9/28/2016,"I rally want to love this app, and I did for the first couple of days - it has two odd the features I want in a music player: good lock screen and it remembers the last song that played even if it was closed for days.
 and then I tried the shuffle button on the songs list, it showed me 0 out of 0 songs and when I tried to get out of there it crashed. since I dint want to create a play list for shuffling over all my songs, this is more or less a deal breaker.
 I would also love to have the option of uploading songs to the cloud
 This review is for the galaxy s2 on Sprint",amazon
2/21/2012,"I love that the music purchased from this app lets me choose what device I want to play it on. Other e-music publishers, will only let you play their music on their devices. However, I can purchase a song on my android, play it on my windows PC, and load it onto my iPod to listen to whenever I want. Also, I am always able to stream the music (when data connected) from the Amazon Cloud.
 
 Keep it up Amazon, this is what purchasing all online media should be like!",amazon
12/16/2013,"Haven't used this app as much on my tablet as I do on my work computer, but so far I love it. I love that when I click the thumbs down button, it automatically goes to the next song. Though it has played the song again when I'm on a different ""station"" on occasion. Is really like it if amazon could fix that. The only other issue I have so far, is trying to close the app entirely from full screen mode. Other than that, I'm really liking this whole service and app!",amazon
5/16/2016,"I absolutely LOVE this feature! This app is AMAZING! I really don't know how i listened to music before this! If you have Prime, or your thinking about getting Prime, get this app. You wont regret it!",amazon
6/8/2016,I can't get enough of Amazon prime music. The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app. The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone.,amazon
6/18/2016,Works great and I love that the songs I purchased are on there. Plus all the other channels that are available. I just wish phone company's didn't hammer us with usage charges,amazon
6/23/2017,Love this player when I am not on a computer. I can listen to music anytime I want with headphone or ear plugs!,amazon
6/13/2017,I have been using this app for a year on my android phone (Verizon droid razr). I uploaded all of the music I own (aprox 15gb) to my cloud drive and use the amazon mp3 app in place of the music app provided by android. I love that it lets me play music on my phone or in my cloud from anywhere or purchase music and play it without having to download. A few glitches here and there but the features and ease of use far outweigh any drawbacks for me.,amazon

You can also load other music to the cloud and listen to it on your phone. It's great!",amazon

5/18/2011,I love to use this app. The downside for me is going to be whether or not I resubscribe to Prime when it comes due. I am not sure I can justify $99 for this privilege. It will be cheaper in the long run to simply buy the music.,amazon

Ever since the last update it randomly ""stutters"" when playing a song or stops competely. I can't get it to clear off my phone after I turn it off. It has also become a pain to navigate.

10/29/2014,dont waste your time. this app stinks. I love free things but the app is free because all of the songs coast money.,amazon
3/2/2012,"This service has been atrocious. Only iTunes is worse. Although iTunes can handle more than 40k songs...... I am a person who has a huge audio collection, and I own an echo, so I'm forced to use Amazon Music for my server to upload my music so I can listen to it on my echo's. This has been a cluster since I was in the beta.... every time they upgrade, it gets worse and worse. After this last update, when I open it, I get an error message that says there is no disk in the drive, and It wont go away, and Amazon Music locks up..... can't use it at all. I've uninstalled and re-installed, and it does the same. About six months ago I called in for support, and they said it could not handle over 40K songs, but I was only at 33K. Still they said it was due to high song amount. I pay amazon so that I'm supposed to be able to upload up to 250K songs. That is not even the worst. I have a compilation set with 4 albums, and Amazon made a different album for each song. It is fraught with issues all the way through, and I have been telling amazon for almost a year about these issues, and it just keeps getting worse. I hope they fix it someday, as I love the Echo... but can't stand this program.",amazon
12/30/2016,Use this app almost daily. Love that we can create our own stations to listen to. Totally like there are no commercials to listen to. But there are 2 complaints I have though. If you put a song in twice by mistake it won't let you delete one of them unless it deletes both from the app. There needs to be a way to just delete a copy. Also when I travel I may be listening to directions and turn it off . As soon as I restart my car starts it comes on / even if I don't turn it on. And if I turn it off and make a phone call it will automatically cone back on. There is just a glitch were it comes on without turning it on that could be fixed. But I love the music and so do my grandchildren. We all have our favorite stations. Highly recommend this Amazon App!,amazon
6/8/2017,"For the most part I am enjoying Prime music--both my library and streaming. Prior to Amazon Prime Music, I mainly used Pandora and Spotify. It is quite obvious that Amazon Prime Music caters to the white, middle-class, mom demographic with the layout and the selection of music. As a millennial I am definitely more drawn to Spotifiy's playlists and classifications for genres. I have a feeling I will grow to love Amazon Prime during my 1-year subscription. However, I was turned off by my initial observation of the main demographic to which Amazon caters.
 So far, I am thoroughly enjoying no ads and the option to download playlists, albums, and songs to my library to listen to offline. That is a big deal for me since I have a small data plan and limited access to Wifi. I'm definitely willing to tryout as much as I can on Prime during my first year of paid access. At this point in time as a business woman and a graduate student, I feel that the $50/year student membership fee is not worth it and most definitely not the regular membership fee.",amazon
3/16/2016,While I love the music the app on my Samsung Note 3 is terrible. It fails repeatedly. It give me a message with a code and tells me to contact customer service. Why does the app not send this report itself? Once the error starts it is hard to even clear as it just keeps retrying the function and errors out again. Today I was just trying to edit a playlist. I have to reboot the phone after I add or delete 3 or 4'songs as the errors start. I don't want to call customer service. Oddly now as I pokaye around it seems picking up the phone is my only option. Nowhere is the online chat support? Send a text or email?,amazon
12/1/2015,I love Amazon and I love love Amazon prime music. I feel like there is actually another person on the other end who knows all the music I love and they just pick the best songs all day!!!it's crazy to find a Mac dre station. I also heard on the news recently that Amazon has spent around 100 million on letting their prime members stream music and movies add free and I just want to say thank you Amazon for being legit! I love this company and everything about it.,amazon
9/22/2015,"Amazon needs to make some major improvements to their Amazon Music App on the Kindle Fire series. It does not work well offline (appears the buffer memory is way too small). Besides not working well offline, you have to actually tell the Kindle Fire device to work offline and then tell it again to work online... How stupid is that? Can't Amazon's own app on it's own name brand device figure out if it is connected to WiFi or not and function accordingly? I love the Amazon Music service concept, but the Amazon Music App currently is so sub-par. In addition, when the Amazon Music App crashes, you literally have to reboot by turning off the Fire and then turning it back on again. On both my Apple and other Android-based devices, in the rare instance that an app does crash, you can wait a few seconds and then just re-launch it. Not so with Amazon Music. To shame!
 
 Also, it appears that the Amazon Music App has functionality issues with reading/writing music files on large memory cards. I have had Amazon Music crash and then my Fire HD 8 suddenly can't read my name-brand 64GB SDHC card after the Amazon Music App crashed. I've had this behavior happen many times... Then it takes a series of reboots to get it to properly read the memory card (and apps loaded on it which are all grayed out on the screen) again. And then the Fire HD 8 and all apps and media on the memory card will work just fine for days, usually as long as Amazon Music App doesn't crash out again!!! So that tells me it's not a bad memory card at all... Somethings wrong with Amazon's app / device.
 
 Overall, the Fire HD 8 Tablet seems to be an excellent low-priced tablet, but the Amazon Music App and phantom memory card error issues are killing it for me. Amazon, you're better than this, right? Get your device and app teams to fix this or I'm moving to Spotify and likely never coming back!",amazon
12/1/2016,"Mediocre at best. The prime music stations are utterly lacking in descriptive information. You are forced to try one-- and if it's absolutely horrible to you? Too bad-- the stupid app thinks you *liked* it, even if you only listened to the first few seconds of each song, before clicking ""no"".. and after 3 or 5? You realize that station is not for you.
 
 But. The app *now* thinks you LIKE that sort of crap-- and offers more of the same dreck! Horrible!
 
 A simple description under each station is too much to ask? Or even just a category label? No? As if I'm supposed to recognize these people (after which the station is named... right)?
 
 I'd love to learn about new artists-- but not at the risk of opening a station that absolutely sets my teeth on edge (i.e. ""cow hard country""... makes me ill).
 
 Where is a FILTER for the prime stations? I don't care what is popular! I just wish to eliminate musical styles I find objectionable-- but there is no way to do this in this app.
 
 One star, all but useless.",amazon
2/24/2016,"I really want to love this app. I really do. Having legally free music is appealing and having good recommendations made has certainly increased the library of music I'm playing.
 
 But this app is absolute garbage. It was designed by someone that never has used a music app before. Maybe it's my phone? I have some spare cell phones, I'll try this on to see if I experience the same issues and update my review.
 
 For reference, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (t-mobile variation) and I'll be testing it on my Nexus 5 (old model) and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus (T-mobile variation) and a Samsung Galaxy S3 if it powers up.
 
 So here are the huge glaring issues with this app and service:
 
 1) You can only upload 250 songs to the cloud. That's pitiful. Amazon is the damn king for cloud computing. I refuse to believe they can't easily and at low cost up that number. Google play music (which I was using before) let's you upload 50,000 songs. A 250 limit severely restricts us and I refuse to rebuy my music catalog from amazon mp3.
 
 2) If you add more music to your playlists from your computer, and you hit download on your app instead of it just downloading the new tracks you added onto the same playlist (ie Favorites) it creates a new playlist (Favorites 01) it doesn't redownload everything, but it's a nuisance. In a year what will I be at? Favorites 69?
 
 3) Why can't think app sync with the music app on my Amazon Fire Tv? With google play music I can connect to google play on my chromecast and play my music on my surround system, I want to do that on here as well so I don't have to constantly skip tracks I've already heard recently.
 
 4) This is the by far the biggest frustrating issue for me.....and related to # 3. This app has never once played a playlist all the way through. And it is INFURIATING. What's the point of having a 800 song playlist if it keeps restarting!?! I listen to music on the way to work and I'll get to track 8 of 800 and when I drive home in the afternoon I should be able to resume on track 9 of 800. But it doesn't. It. Keeps. Restarting. So I spend most of time skipping tracks, because ""i just heard that this morning, heard that yesterday."" Google Play Music never once had this issue.
 
 I want to hear a playlist all the way through. I want to get home, sync the app to amazon fire tv and listen to music as I wash dishes, then go to the gym and continue my playlist. And I want to not have the playlist keep starting over again every time I open the app.
 
 I switched from Google Play Music because of the allure of all that free prime music, and it has introduced me to some really great stuff I'd never heard before. But the app is currently a brokayen mess.",amazon
5/26/2016,"Have on phone and tablet. Love I can play from device or cloud. Downloads very easy to SD card with help from mover app. I have play lists on each that work for the device I'm using. Love that purchases automatically added. I am very happy with a great tool.....app. One request ...please add back the ability to add more play lists to currently playing. Thank you.
 Update****** So unhappy, this had been a favorite app of almost all my apps, I now hate it with a purple passion. Please please fix this. I can no longer see what I have added or purchsed in my music loaded to my device. There for, I just purchased a song and it take for ever, FOREVER to add it to playlists. I use playlists all the time. I would go to the play list, and to the purchsed and add the new songs, no can do now., or go to the purchased and the new song and add it to the playlists Now I can only do it through songs, albums, etc. It takes forever and is no longer fun to do. Music must be easy and fun, it is not about work, but bringing joy, happiness, relief, healing etc to my life, NOT STRESS. Please Please make it fun and easy and stress free again, make it the best again, instead of the worst app I have. Thank you. I am so sad to have had to write this. Was 5 stars, now 1. Please let me put it back up to 5 stars.",amazon
3/11/2014,"I used to love this app (when it was still an orange icon). The latest update ruined what was better than iTunes. I have this on my iPhone because I used to like it better than iTunes. It was much easier to navigate while driving. The latest update ruined that. It is now so complicated and counter-intuitive that I can't even really use it while I'm driving. Since I spend about 20-30 hours on the road every week, that's a problem.
 
 This latest update didn't even fix what has been the biggest problem with the app since I have used it. It treats compilation albums as though each artist is a separate albums. So instead of one Christmas album with 14 songs, in the albums list, you have 14 albums, each one song in length because of the different artists. Ridiculous!
 
 Other issues I have had since the update include losing individual songs from albums that were uploaded from CDs. Jumper from my Third Eye Blind album just vanished from the middle of the album. No other songs, just the one song. Go figure. What's worse, is that albums that I purchased from Amazon disappeared altogether. For example, I had purchased the full version of Maroon 5 (the Animals album) along with the lyrics bookay. Since there is a ""Prime"" version of this, all of a sudden, I had the prime version with no lyrics bookay. I was able to re-download the version I had purchased but it still sucked to discover that on a three hour drive and no time to pull over and figure out what the hell was going on. Because it was the prime version, it wasn't in my normal list of offline albums. So initially it lookayed like it vanished altogether.
 
 The controls are my biggest issue with this new update. What used to be simple, straight forward controls are now ""fancied up"" to the point where they are almost as dangerous as texting to try to used while driving, especially trying to switch between albums. The menu defaults to settings instead of just sticking to my offline albums list.
 
 UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I just clicked the app to double check what I am saying here and all of my albums are gone. Literally all of my music, except, oddly the one song that I have purchased from iTunes recently. THAT song is still there. Everything else is literally wiped out. I'm done. I'm going back to iTunes. Amazon, someone needs to be fired for overthinking, over-engineering and just throwing a bunch of bells and whistles at this app, instead of fixing the actual problems with it.",amazon
11/18/2016,"I don't understand how this app doesn't have all 5 star ratings. There is nothing it could possibly do better. I've stopped using Pandora altogether. Absolutely a must download for any Prime member.
 
 UPDATE: After using this app for several months now, I am still in love with it. The navigation is pretty simple and doesn't require re-thinking all the time. Lyrics display if you want them to, which is a cool feature I've not seen anywhere else. Album art, great selection, the same stuff doesn't play over and over again, it's just great. Also, I haven't noticed an abundance of live albums which always bugged me on Pandora. I don't want to listen to live recordings, I want the studio release! If you love live music and hate studio stuff, I suppose that's an issue.
 
 I continue to add to my library constantly and this is just the #1 music app in my opinion. I don't believe it has the ability to identify a song that is playing on the radio or anything like that, which is an improvement I would like to see. I currently use Google's widget for song identifying, then add it to my amazon library.",amazon
3/19/2016,"I love this app! Being a prime member has so many benefits, I recommend to all my family and friends. I can set up different playlists easily. It is the most uncomplicated music app to use!! I get many free songs that are currently popular and they also have many older songs from all genres. The only thing I wish Amazon would add is a way for me to stream the music through my playstation 4!! Thanks so much Amazon!",amazon
7/31/2015,"Updated 11/16/16 - I updated all of the drivers on my Dell laptop and now this app is working. I was having issues with my laptop waking up when I moved it to and from the docking station. Updating my drivers fixed that problem and appears to have fixed the issues with this app too. I also un/reinstalled it several times. Upon opening it for the first time this time, I didn't dismiss the banner for signing up for Amazon Music. I don't know if that is why it's working or if it truly is the driver update. I wanted to add this though in case it will help anyone else. :)
 **********************
 I used to love this app. My work won't let us have iTunes and now that it's been updated, it barely works at all. It freezes then fast shuffles through my playlist without actually playing any of the music. I have uninstalled/reinstalled three times to no avail. Also, it's messing with other programs on my computer now. I thought maybe it was something that happened to my playlist but I can't play anything. Opening/closing doesn't help, creating a new playlist (if I can get it to work long enough) doesn't work. Streaming from Prime doesn't work. It's causing me to waste a lot more time at work than I really have but I can't work without my music! This is all stuff I've purchased too so it's not like I am trying to get something for free or streaming pirated music or anything like that. I buy all of my music from Amazon. This is soooooooooo disappointing. Help! Isn't anyone reading these reviews that can fix it?",amazon
11/10/2016,"I did not know this was a feature of Amazon Prime! Pleasantly surprised to discover this amazing option. I love classic country from the 60's through the 80's and there is a great selection available! One thing I find slightly annoying about Prime is that you pay a premium for the service. Then Amazon gives you what appears to be a partial service with an ""upgrade"" available for another few dollars a month in subscription services. Don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with the Prime product, but the ""upsale"" attempts are annoying and make me feel as though I've been played by Amazon. Maybe it's just me, but this is not the way I would market the service.",amazon
7/18/2017,"I love this app. Well, I LOVED this app. After one update, and then another, it's less and less helpful. All the music I own is through Amazon, plus I'm a PRIME member, so I should be able to play all the PRIME music for free. But it's not working out. Music I've bought and paid for is downloaded onto my phone and then immediately deleted without my permission. PRIME music won't play. And other songs that I've deleted from my phone keep re-downloading - again, without my permission. And other songs that do play when tap on them individually, won't play in a playlist. It's very frustrating. I've deleted and re-downloaded this app several times, but nothing helps. And every update makes things worse.

 I no longer have to go to YouTube and listen to less quality music while keeping my phone open so YouTube works. Every song I want is in this.
 The annual fee isn't bad at all for not having to worry about paying every month, or not finding your song, or listening to ads. It's really a small price.
 Plus, I didn't find that they removed songs or at least that many songs from their prime anyway.
 I honestly don't know what people are so irate about.
 After all, you get what you pay for. You don't think $99 per year would get you free 2 day shipping, free choices of movies and videos, and unlimited music?

5/12/2017,"I love this app. I have registered both iPhones with Amazon and with each prime album I have purchased for free I've been able to down load to iPhones,and both of my kindle fires. My album collection stored in my cloud really got a whole lot bigger. Thanks to Amazon prime .",amazon
7/24/2014,"I wanted to chime in on Amazon Prime Music. I have been using this service for about a year and a half now. I absolutely love the easy access to my music collection whether I am on the internet at work, out in the world with my phone, chilling with my tablet, or enjoying music through the home surround sound Prime Music is ready to go and streams well!
 
 However! I am a serious music collector and I adore having my collection labeled correctly, correct album art, and organised by year of release. Not too much to ask, these are STANDARD music program features since the first Windows Media Player and iTunes....
 
 Well you can not change your album art in Amazon Prime Music! In the year 2015 and after years of complaints in the forums you still cannot do this. Yes, there are bogus work arounds like finding the artwork cache on your PC and pasting new arrowroot in there with the same file name as the bad artwork. However this only affects your PC amazon music player, it does not change on your tablet, phone, website etc. Then there is the method of downloading your album back to your PC, adding it to a better music player, using that music players artwork change feature, and then import it back to Amazon Prime Music which may or may not take it or just paste the wrong artwork on it again! Either way this is ridiculous and for a serious music collection this will take YEARS to correct my collection to my standards. So yeah, this is a MAJOR issue for me that really bugs me. Albums will have the wrong artwork, sometimes 3 albums in a row have the same wrong artwork, and many just don't have artwork at all.
 
 You also are very limited in how you can view your music, no option for sorting or display release years which is another big issue for me. The program also displays your music very literally by artist instead of album artist. What does this mean? Well instead of displaying lets say all of Beyonce's music under one artist heading of Beyonce, Amazon will have 30+ Beyonce artists, one for every Feat she has ever done. The only way to condense this is to change the artist to Beyonce and lose the information on who she is singing with. This is soooooo frustrating!!
 
 When it really comes down to it if i had a better option i would absolutely ditch Prime Music because it is just far too simplistic and limited for my tastes but when you already have a Prime account the price is just too sweet to ignore along with Amazon's fantastic storage limit and bonus features etc. and like i said before, having all your music everywhere and anywhere is pretty awesome! Overall i do like the service but there are just unacceptable issues that frustrate on a daily basis and after over 3 years of this program existing im just left scratching my head at how a giant like Amazon does not fix these issues.... I want to love it Amazon! And it is so easy to fix it so just do it already! I will only hang on so much longer that's for sure!",amazon
7/17/2015,I love whole prime option. I am a disabled veteran that is home bound. I love music so the music part I really love. I have not got into the movie part yet but I plan to very soon. I bought a good blue tooth speaker that makes the music sound awesome. I wish this was all a little easier to work and learn. I have about 3500 songs but I know there are a lot of doubles. It would be nice to be able to have the app identify doubles and ask before before you down loaded it again. It seems like this might be something you want to control on your PC. I lookay forward to the movie part. I use prime to make purchases and I really like that part. Help to make the music more user friendly. Thanks,amazon

It's great for listening to purchased music, and with Amazon Prime there are tons and tons of great music to listen to for free (not really free because you pay for a prime membership) but it's a wonderful perk and if used enough you get your money worth!!

1/26/2017,"Adding my voice here. Currently using up 3.52 GB of my usable 4.94 GB. Refuses to be relegated to SD card storage. Read about some app that will let you move your purchased music to SD but won't move prime music. I guess prime just has to be streamed if you want to use it. Lookay amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone. You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected. You don't need to hog my internal memory. I guess you are only for top end phone users. I can't afford you.
 
 Listen from the cloud you say? Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and don't let the phone display go dark, the music stops. I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.
 
 So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what? It tookay the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone. Music that I use other apps to play since those apps don't stop every 15 seconds. Amazon, I love you. But I hate your music app.",amazon
6/10/2015,"I love Prime music, but the delivery system (download/streaming) could be greatly improved. There seems to be way too many hiccups. Songs start and stop very frequently. Play button is still activated, but shutting it off and starting it back on doesn't resolve the stoppage. So... you skip to the next song. This is really the last thing any of us want to do: micro-manage our streaming music player instead of listening to music and doing other things while we listen (novel concept). I think the song rotation is better than I-Tunes but the stability of the player... not so much. Three stars might be a bit optimistic.",amazon
8/15/2015,"Absolutely love this service!!! Probably one of the main reasons I continue my prime membership. I have XM radio and this service way out performs XM radio. I listen to Amazon Prime Music way more than XM now. I can pick my own songs and play it from my library or chose from the Prime library.
 
 The only CON I can think of right now is Amazon Prime Music needs a COMEDY channel, that is the only reason I still have XM radio.

9/3/2016,"I used to LOVE Amazon's Music App, but with the recent change they eliminated a lot of features that I used and turned the app into something that is to me completely useless.
 
 CONS
 
 0) It's just slow, and laggy, and freezes all the time. While I'm uploading or it decides to download something (completely outside of my control) it can not be used.
 
 EDIT***
 
 Since the time of my originally posting this review amazon has introduced several updates that have incremementally begun to address my problem and I am so thankful for that. I had started using another music player but it is so much easier to have the program that i use to download my music also play it and it's great to see that a company as big as Amazon can listen to complaints and improve on products. I STILL want it to be a lot easier to remove music from my computer directly from the ap but they added the ""see file on computer"" option back again so if I really want to I guess I can use that. Thanks Amazon.
 
 1) On the new app they have this extensive list/filtering system which is mostly redundant and yet so complicated I hardly ever know what subset of my music I am listening to. Is it my OFFLINE music, on the CLOUD, filtered by download date... or is it the ALBUMS section with ALL MUSIC, yet only purchased songs ordered by upload date? There is NOTHING smart about this set-up and it only serves to obscure the next point
 
 2) I CAN'T STOP IT FROM DOWNLOADING EVERYTHING! I like to try out new albums/songs and support artists.. So I buy the album and keep it on the cloud and download my favorite songs for easy listening even without internet (yaknow if I wind up in the stone ages or something..) Maybe somewhere along the line I accidentally hit dl everything, although I don't believe that I did- but even so I can not find any setting that would be able to help me change that! furthermore they tookay away the ability to click on a song and find it on my computer which I could have potentially used to delete unwanted songs from my computer. AND NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO DELETE A SONG INSTEAD OF GIVING ME THE OPTION TO DELETE IT FROM THE COMPUTER OR THE CLOUD IT ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT THE CLOUD.
 
 3) It's now more difficult than ever to donload or upload songs when I want to... having me drag and drop songs onto the words, upload or download is totally unintuitive especially since I usually like to deal in multiple songs.. which leads me to the INABILITY TO HIGHLIGHT MULTIPLE SONGS. That is a completely necessary/useful option that I don't understand the logic behind taking out.
 
 4) When I click ""make a playlist"" from this song- nothing happens... I probably just do not understand what I was supposed to do maybe? But I am fairly computer literate and a programmer myself so if I can not understand it I assume that most are quite perplexed.
 
 PROS
 
 The color scheme is nicer... the icon lookays good?
 
 I originally was going to give this app a 2 star rating becuse I think the aesthetics really were an upgrade... but honestly there is such a downgrade in functionality this app is terrible now.. If there were any other way to easily download and listen to my music that I buy from Amazon I would be there right now..",amazon

4/19/2017,"UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.
 
 Original Review:
 No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)
 
 What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.
 
 Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.
 
 Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.
 
 As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.
 
 Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional.",amazon
4/26/2012,"Wake up Amazon. You do a lot of great things, this app is not one of them. If you want to compete with Spotify etc. you need to at least meet if not exceed their functionality.

To listen to anywhere & anytime I choose. Thank You Amazon & All of the Awesome Musicians that share there musical talent & gift with the rest of us out here.",amazon
3/15/2015,I've finally cut the ties with all Apple devices and no longer have any need for iTunes. I especially love this app on my Galaxy S4 while driving in my car using blutooth. The only problem I have is sometimes albums are split into multiple folders. I was amazed to find that all the mp3's that I've ever purchased from Amazon showed up on my device as available to stream!,amazon
5/18/2014,"As much as I love Amazon, this app is atrocious. The MP3s that I upload have solid, complete tags with album art embedded and without fail, Amazon Music continues to split albums and ignore my embedded album art. I can understand occasional hiccups with such a vast repository, but this Amazon Music library system is well beyond buggy.
 
 If I had to guess, I'd say the app is actually working as intended, but the database and index system that exist in the cloud is so anemic and antiquated, that it can't handle the simple and fundamental functions that I've come to expect from a music library application.
 
 Please review and consider an overhaul, Amazon. I love Prime, love my FireTV and love Echo, but this music system doesn't deserve to be included in that list. Sorry.",amazon
7/1/2015,"I love the prime music. I have put together a mix of music to listen to during my work day. Anyone that knows me knows how much I love music. Since my Ipod is on the outs I have used Amazon Prime music nearly every day. I listen to it while I am mowing, doing my walk in the evenings, at work and in my truck. Great benefit to having Prime.",amazon
9/20/2016,I used to love this app recently it stops playing music after one song. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the same problem is occurring. I also do not like the fact that the app starts on startup & permissions cannot be changed. I have amazon prime but the music app is lacking.,amazon
7/6/2016,"First impressions after a week of use: Love it! Coming from Pandora I am almost overwhelmed with what to listen to next. I love Pandora, but it is not like this. I'm not sure I will like the price once the reduced cost trial ends. And I still need to figure out if I can make it work with my Yamaha surround system.",amazon
7/18/2017,"Love just about everything about this app. I can share my music easily on all my devices, computer, tablet and phone. It's easy to access and it shows how many songs and how long my playlist will last. Makes it easy to plan my listening day.",amazon
7/18/2017,"Dear Amazon,
 
 Can you please add a Music Visualizer to this app? pretty please? I'd love to play my Prime Music playlists through the tv box on my projector when i have guests (who are usually inpressed by the app's sophistication and music variety) but no one wants to stare at the prime music menu pg all evening. Putting on the app then having ppl witness as I go back to start up a seperate visualizer kinda... undermines the app's quality....
 
 IF you ALREADY have Amazon prime because you like 2-day shipping and knowing your getting a great deal without sacrificing peace of mind.... then there literally is ZERO reason to forgo free access to thousands of (downloadable) songs available on Prime Music.....Unless, of course, you're from some bizarro universe, in the multiverse, where in 2016, people still pay for music you can access on for free w/ pandora, spotify, etc.
 
 Meant as a call to action rather than an insult, if u have Prime, do yourself a favor and check out prime music..... maybe also try moving away from your ""aol.com"" email address, if u still have one? Digital literacy is no longer luxury, but necesity. It includes trying out new things because you may find you like said new things.
 
 Last but not least, to those of you who are complaining about the app downloading ur ENTIRE library to ur device... its time to tinker with ur in-app settings, because this app is rather light and agile for the range of functionality it has (and will def be the best once they add a visualuzer to the app, providing seamless engagement opportunities across user devices)",amazon
5/30/2016,"I use Amazon Music all day everyday. It's my source of music. I utilize Alexa in my apartment and the Amazon Music app while mobile with my Pixel XL. I love it! Today I noticed Alexa was integrated with the app. This has been a feature I've desired for awhile now, however, you have to tap the Alexa icon in the Amazon Music app to activate the voice commands. I know it was probably no small feat to integrate Alexa into the app so I'm even considering my three stars a bit harsh. For the sake of experience I'm giving this three stars because of the Alexa integration. Hopefully this critizisam encourages even more innovation. The experience would be even more perfection if when the app was open I could use voice commands with Alexa when my phone was locked or unlocked without having to touch any GUI. It would make my experience with the app even more delightful if I could do that while walking my dogs or jogging. Hands free Alexa while mobile...now that would be amazing! ??",amazon
10/1/2017,I love Amazon prime music I haven't listened to music like this sense my 20'S and 30'S they make it so easy I have 6 different Playlist so easy to add too. I love even the stations no advertising just music any way to many perks to even try to list them all,amazon
6/22/2016,"I love the radio stations and playlists, and love being able to put my own collection up there. I listen at work all day.",amazon
4/8/2017,"Love the app. I like that I can turn off my screen and still listen on my Android. Also, I like that I can add a play list online with Prime which I think is easier on the computer. Can swipe down or hit the screen on for pause option. Nice!",amazon
7/31/2017,"I am able to hear music selections from albums that I wouldn't have heard unless I used a torrent site and download the whole album. As far as I am concerned this is the best perk to Amazon prime.The best thing for me is when in NYC subway, my phone has no signal between stations, but yet Prime Music works 90% of the time. Meaning it will play the next song in the in your queue with no signal. I don't know how it does it but I love it.",amazon
2/1/2016,"The Amazon Music app has become my app of choice for accessing the library of music on my phone and also music in my Amazon cloud storage. What I love about this app is it also provides access to TONS of Prime music, which is free to those with Prime accounts. I love the stations and playlists. I use them when working out or when I'm out for a bike ride. I select a station or playlist, and I'm on my way. Amazon selects a very nice collection of music to keep me company. The stations gear musical selections around the sensibility of the artist chosen. So the Jimi Hendrix station, for example, plays artists who are in the same general musical family as Hendrix. Amazon also tosses in a few Hendrix pieces too. There are hundreds--possibly thousands--of stations and playlists to choose from
 
 My only criticism relates to getting a feel for how the app works. It tookay me a little while to figure out how to access the library on my phone and how to flip between my device music and my cloud music. Be careful of this! If you've saved your music to your phone and want to listen to it on your phone, be sure you've selected Device! If not, it'll go to the cloud to stream. You'll eat up data doing that. I've made this mistake a few times.
 
 Very much recommended!",amazon
7/17/2015,"I absolutely LOVE Amazon Prime Music! The choices are endless and 90% of the music I am lookaying for is included in my membership. I downloaded the app on my phone and have replaced my previous streaming music with it! I love how you can have your own library of you favorites, but choose a station to listen to when you feel like something different. They have channels to suit any mood and you can set up different playlists from your library. The best part, is when you hear a song that is streaming that you like, you just hit the plus sign and it adds it to your library and then provides you with alternatives you might like as well.",amazon
6/24/2015,"I was really excited at first. As a Prime customer I was thrilled to see I had access to 1 million songs. And a lot of the songs on offer are right up my alley. The first day I added over 200 songs to my library.
 
 But the Android App is now nearly unusable. It was great before but now is just horrible. I've been able to listen to maybe five of these songs in the last week as this app is so buggy. It won't load. It crashes frequently. The song pauses every few seconds due to poor, slow streaming quality. The app is also an enormous resource hog. It takes up most of the RAM and drains the battery. My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all. I love that it remains ""running"" when it doesn't even work.
 
 The desktop program is tolerable. It was annoying trying to install flash in chrome and tookay a long time to set it up but I can live with that. I cannot tolerate the phone app. If things don't improve soon I will uninstall it and will also not renew my Prime Membership.",amazon
6/26/2014,"I never even finished installing this bit of spyware, there's no reason they need access to my browser history or my bookaymarks. I pay enough for prime and my music that Amazon doesn't need to be trying to make money from my private info, too. If they ever trim the list down to the things they actually need, I may try again. But as we all know, big companies don't care at all about our privacy or the fact that we're human beings, not ""consumers"", so that won't happen. If you love the idea of this company keeping track of every little thing you do, then go ahead and install it!
 
  Since I cannot use music purchased through Amazon the way I wish, I really need to rethink where I'm spending my money. Very disappointed in Amazon as a whole, my privacy matters.",amazon
3/11/2015,"My newest addiction is amazon prime music. I use the app primarily on my phone. I love the pre-made playlists. Very easy for an indecisive music fan. Just pick what type of music I'm in the mood for, or a band I like, and Amazon does the rest. I stream this in the car, in the office, and in the gym. Tons of free music available through prime. No complaints from me. I've tried Milk music, Pandora, and other similar apps. I like Amazon music the best.",amazon
2/19/2016,"I love the Cloud Drive and Cloud Player. Frankly I had this app frozen on my rooted Droid 2 until Amazon came out with Cloud Player. Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.
 
 The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio bookays. Everytime I close the program for a second (hit the home key or switch tasks) I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I (many times) have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.
 
 UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now (especially for Amazon, who doesn't have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song) and there are so many competitors (Google Play Music, for instance) I can't justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs (which tookay almost a day!) then deleted. You've lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage.",amazon
5/3/2011,have alexa and I am always playing amazon stations and music on her love it nice to have when doing work around the house. Found this when I got a pair of blue tooth ear buds and I wanted to play music when I go to gym. Have not used music in a very long time when working out forgot how much easier it is to do. Love this because of all the radio different stations and individual playlist that you can make it is fantastic.Sure wish I would have done this sooner. Thanks Amazon,amazon
7/27/2016,"I love this service. It could use some tweaking as far as getting to know my tastes, but I think maybe I need to use it more. The only reason it's not 5 star is because they don't have a whole lot of new using available to listen to for Prime memebers. Otherwise in an are where I have internet, the service works seamlessly and the sound is pretty good.",amazon
8/12/2015,I have used other options for my music. Amazon music is the best so far! I love that I get digital copies of my purchases immediately and can enjoy the music before I recieve my actual CD. I live that with Prime I can share my Amazon options with my household!! I just love Amazon! I used to be an eBay customer but Prime offers so many benefits that the competition can't compare. Having Amazon music on top of all the other great Amazon products just makes it sweeter!,amazon
7/1/2016,Forced new update is a complete disaster. Horrible interface that take more time/work to get anything done. Tons of music I never uploaded to the app is now there that I have to go through to make my playlists. I love that if I contact Amazon to complain and ask to go back to the old app their only answer is that you can't once you've installed it. That's nice except for I didn't install it. I'll have to see if I can get my music onto my echo with some other program or through it in the trash where it belongs now that this garbage has been forced on me.,amazon
10/13/2016,"I used to love Amazon Music and would recommend it to everyone; not anymore.This app has become so buggy it's almost unusable. It will just stay running in the background for hours despite closing it multiple times.
 
 With Android Auto... OH My GOD it's awful! I can only access Recently Played, Recommended Stations, and a couple of other avenues that Amazon tries to force feed me. I have no way to browse the THOUSANDS of songs I purchased THROUGH AMAZON. I can't access My Playlists, nothing. If I unplug the phone, go to the playlist, artist, or song I want and then start playing it, I can then plug it into my car and listen to that, and ONLY that selection. Obviously, that's not ideal when you're trying to drive.

5/23/2017,It great piece to have tons of music to choose from! Loving it!,amazon
5/4/2017,Lots of product but I just didn't use it enough to justify spending over a $100 dollars a year on this. Plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can't pay monthly which sucks. Maybe if they started charging monthly I'd sign up again. The free 2 days shipping on products was goo thought. But I never watched a movie or listened to a song on Amazon.,amazon

5/29/2017,"In addition to the ridiculous list of things it wants access to, this app would not let me log in to my own Prime profile. It kept logging me in under my mother, even when I put my own email and password in multiple times. She doesn't have Amazon Prime or any of my music, so all the music I just saved to my library apparently is now worthless. I guess I just go back to Spotify. At least that's a lot easier to use and lets me log in to my own profile.",amazon

6/15/2014,"For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment. First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality. This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you. Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time. Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am positive that you could develop whatever you want. I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with. Very dissapointed. Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else. Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy. Good luck with your new fire products. Lookays like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever.

6/25/2016,"Although, I must admit the number of albums seems quite astonishing, I'm not satisfied for a few reasons. First and foremost: their marketing and cheap gimmick tactics to increase member subscriptions. Signing up for a free trial membership is usually something I'm wary about, but I tookay the bait this time and low and behold, after one month of use, I was charged a YEAR subscription renewal fee! Most companies will just charge for the next month and that seems reasonable, but surely this is a ploy to increase revenues and artificially inflate membership while skirting customer satisfaction because at the end of the day they bank on folks like myself simply forgetting to cancel their 'free' trial membership. Numero dos: while the music I've listened to has been great, and I enjoy their offline access to albums, they do not have any of the simple user-friendly displays like some other music counterparts (Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc. etc.). If you're listening on a web browser, it's constantly being opened into new tabs and nothing is intuitive. Also, with no filter to search prime music (when clicking on other music that might interest you) could lead to folks accidentally purchasing products they thought were free. Number three: after resigning to the fact that I purchased this membership, I tried to watch some programs on my tablet and low and behold! Does not work with most Android products. Or Chromecast (to my knowledge). Now that I've purchased the year subscription, I'll certainly give this a shot. But fool me once Amazon, shame on you. You have one year to win me back.",amazon

Got a new phone, and I downloaded the new Amazon Music app. What it shows as 'Cloud' music is only about 1% of the music I store on Amazon's cloud servers. I can't really review any other feature of the app, because my music is not accessible. I called Amazon, and was told they were working on it.

 Just make sure you are on wifi when you hit a pocket of awesome tunes.",amazon
4/28/2016,One of the best music channels out there!!! Thank you Amazon!!,amazon
4/29/2017,I don't understand the negative comments. There is a ton of free music for Prime members. Easy to access and easy to play. And I am a grandma :),amazon
1/29/2016,I wish I could download purchased music directly to my phone. Instead I have to go through this disgusting app Amazon is stuffing down my throat.,amazon
10/19/2015,"The music / mantras that I like to listen to are on Amazon Unlimited of which I have to pay for. It's o $2 less than Google Music which isn't much of a difference so decided to keep Google Music. Mainly, I don't want to have to go through and reset playlists also.",amazon

3/15/2017,Solid app for music streaming and downloading. The best part is that there are constant updated virtual stations and playlist that are spot on. One of my most used apps.,amazon
9/25/2016,It asked me when I first tried to download where I want music stored. I chose sd card and that's where they're being stored. Anyone having difficulties may be using an earlier version. May want to uninstall and reinstall to see if that will help.,amazon
1/31/2016,Huge 3dg and staind fan! From the second I listened to it I could hear bits and pieces of them but this is not those bands! This is much harder than 3dg and more composed then staind. I haven't bought an album in 5 years...this was worthy enough to buy and it's been on repeat since I got it! Incredible band and I'm stokayed on their music! If you like hard rock with small amounts of metal and insanely good lyrics...buy this album!,amazon
9/5/2015,Great its part of Prime,amazon
4/29/2017,"I loved this at first. I was excites thinking FINALLY something better than Pandora! But day one songs stopped half way through to load like there was a connection issue each time I left home. I was using 4G so I don't get that. since then, it's happening more and more frequently. Whether I'm home or not, on Wi-Fi or 4G. Still keeps stopping mid-song to either load or the app just crashes altogether. It has potential but I'm disappointed I had to go back to Pandora.",amazon

6/18/2016,"This was a forced update that if you uninstall it, it removes your amazon app completely. I lost all of my playlists, and there are a lot more steps to get to the song or album you want. Too many drop down menus, and too may ads. And I don't know if this has anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen has changed and now I have multiple pages to move thru to find what I want. Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it.",amazon
6/18/2014,"This is my favorite music app and I have it on my Fire TV, Fire Tablet and Android Phone. Recent updates to this app on my Android Phone had me wondering why some of my music was missing, particularly music that I purchased and songs selected for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App updates did not negatively affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discovered that it was Google Play and not Amazon that changed my playlists and eliminated some of my favorite songs. I had to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app, so it could only be downloaded from the Amazon web site. There were many negative reviews of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it is because of the changes that Google Play makes to the app on installation and updates. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when downloaded by Google Play. When I installed this app again from the Amazon web site, it was perfect in form and function. No stalling and stopping and no missing songs.",amazon

10/14/2016,"I should have know Amazon Prime (Music/Kindle/Video) was too good to be true! Like Netflix, RedBox and any of the others like it, there are always loopholes/limitations. Every movie, song, bookay I've tried to download, it wasn't included in the Prime package. I can just as easily wait for the bookay to come out at my local library and read it for free. The same applies to music/videos. Lookays like the only thing that I'm going to benefit from by purchasing Prime is the free shipping for my Christmas shopping.",amazon
3/30/2015,"We have tried using this on several different devices thinking that maybe that the app was just not working with the device (yes, we know only 1 device at time). However, the shuffle doesn't really 'shuffle', the music will just stop without notice, and the Prime music to the computer and the Prime music to the device do not sync.
 
 Since this is still a new feature, we will be holding out to see how it adapts.",amazon

10/26/2016,"I rate Amazon Music app higher than its two top-rated competitors' apps -- Google Play Music and Audials. Brilliantly designed user interface that is easy to use and navigate. Immense library of music. Also, Amazon Music app works great on Fire tablets and real Android devices, such as Samsung mobile devices. Amazon nailed it dead-on with its music app. Woot, Woot, Woot for Amazon!",amazon

10/28/2017,Since the last update I can't get the app to work on my PC at all. The app slows to a death march speed. I have removed it from my system.,amazon
1/6/2017,"It is doesn't have every song of every musician out there which kind of sucks. However, I do like the prime station and I like that I can add a song to make my own playlist. The other down side to this though is that when you listen to a prime station you can't go back to see what the previous songs and artist are.",amazon
9/24/2016,"If I could give this app negative stars, I would.
 
 I have been a longtime Amazon customer (since the '90's). When the Amazon MP3 app came out, it was great. There were free daily MP3's, and I bought quite a bit of music from my phone. Then in updates it would become sluggish, but then you'd get a new (Android) phone and it would be okayay. But then there was the change to Amazon Music, and the authentication scheme Amazon came up with for this would then break my login in other Amazon apps (Shopping and Kindle). It became unusable on my last phone. When I got my current phone I tried it again, and it worked for maybe a month, before it suddenly decided that my phone had been registered to someone else and I could not access my cloud library or Prime Music.
 
 Amazon Customer Support for this is pretty much non-existent--they will only talk to you on the phone, and then they'll tell you to wipe your phone and start over reinstalling EVERYTHING, which is ridiculous.
 
 I recently tried the app again, and it was miraculously working for no obvious reason (though the Kindle app would then keep asking me to re-login), but with this most recent update it is now once again brokayen for me--it gives me a network error, so I tried reverting to my backup of the previous version, and guess what, it now says that my phone was registered to someone else and I can't access my cloud library or Prime Music.
 
 So, I give up Amazon. I've bought a ton of crap from you, and I would probably buy a lot more music from you if I could buy it on my phone and be an even happier Prime customer if I could listen to Prime Music on my phone, but this app is a total disaster and the biggest black mark on my otherwise sterling opinion of your company. The shopping and Kindle apps work great, Music works great on my iPad (and Kindle Fire and Fire TV), so I don't know what your problem is.",amazon
4/13/2016,"It's a great app and with Prime Music it became even better.
 I really wish if I could get access to Prime Music even when I'm not in the US,
 that's definitely would make it the best music streaming app ever.
 
 I contacted Amazon Customers Service and asked them about playing music through Prime Music outside the US.They told me that I must have a credit card issued in the USA in my Amazon account to be able to listen to Prime Music even when not in the US.
 
 I have deleted the US credit card and that what caused the problem.",amazon

6/22/2016,"1) When you but a digital album you should be able to download in 1 or 2 clicks. Amazon forces you to load the app, wait for the library to update (which takes some time), find it in the library, then download it. If the internet were ubiquitous, I would not need to download. But since it isn't I download first. Please don't make this so hard.
 
 2) Each time I buy something, I am prompted to download the app (with a pop us that really pushes you to download the app). I already have the app, so quit confusing me.",amazon

4/6/2016,"The Good: prime members get a lot of free music, buying song is easy, the quality is also very good, like the addition of the lyrics.
 
 The Bad: sometimes it crashes, I can't edit playlist without interrupting the music, and I saw that the app drains a lot of battery comparing with other music players. And is a little confusing at first when trying to organize your music.

7/7/2016,"the worst app for moving music i have ever seen, im fan of amazon and using alexa with amazon echo a lot, but this app is something out of ordinary, you realy have to make an effort to design app so poor.
 what i think most people will use this all with their amazon prime subscription is upload music and then listen to echo when needed... but whole process is so slow and complicated, its not even worth using it. after few hours of trying to upload, i only managed to made my Echo play 10-20 of my music, out of 100s i tried to upload.
 whole process is designed to be worst possible user friendly one. i think only person who will understand whats going is the guy who wrote the program.
 realy hoped that thery will change interface of do something with this app. but 5 months passed and nothing.
 
 realy disappointed with amazon.... as said in the beguiling im real fan and admirer of whole amazon chain but this is just CRAP!!!",amazon
12/25/2016,"I like what Amazon is planning on doing with Prime Music, however the selection is still scarce. Secondly it feels like, with Prime Music, they (Amazon) still want you to purchase music. If you like buying albums of a whole artist go you'll like this, but if you like to pick and choose go with Spotify instead. Also, if you like finding obscure, less known or independent artists on Amazon you're going to run into problems. Seriously, at $10 dollars a month ( $5 for students first time) Spotify is a far superior product.",amazon
8/18/2014,"It was nice having a large selection of free music with my Prime membership, but latest update seems to have taken a lot of that away.

12/29/2016,"I'm a Spotify user, having used Rhapsody for years before that. I don't buy my music to listen to. Given that, let's just say that Amazon Prime's new music addition is really next to worthless. As most of us Prime members have come to realize, the number of products covered by the Prime membership increasingly smaller and is always in flux, at its best. In some cases, it's almost laughable. Now Amazon want to tell us they've added value to the membership by featuring these incidental cuts from a tiny minority of albums that one can hear for ""free."" Not to mention one needs their Amazon Music with Prime Music app! This is largely a piece of trash. Try getting it off your device once you've installed it! Surprise, it's part and parcel of the increasingly restrictive OS of the Kindle Fire now (don't know about others). What's more, there's no way to opt out of its constantly being loaded into memory.
 
 Come on Amazon, isn't it time that you give your Prime customers some credit for choosing Prime? MUST we make _exclusive_ use of every product you offer us as members? It's becoming much more an indentured servitude than a perks membership. Even more, with every product you become more restrictive than before. Do you consider us mindless fools? Really? Gee thanks.",amazon

I waited all day for a call back, no help. She told me to contact my anti-virus company, I have AVG, and I have allowed adobe and importer to download.

6/25/2016,"CLUNKY! Yes, it does the trick, but sometimes I get confused as to where to lookay for things. Want to see albums by a certain artist? okay, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!
 
 It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.
 
 Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.
 
 The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is).",amazon

10/25/2015,"Nice to have on the phone, but it doesn't work with the Samsung Multiroom app unless you buy songs for your library - at least so far I didn't find a way to use it with my bluetooth speaker at home.",amazon
3/13/2017,"The search function could be more user friendly, and it would be awesome if you could organize your library by genre, so if you want to hear only a specific type of music, you ould do that. I understand that there are playlists for this, but the amount of songs you can add to each list is limited to like 60. Its better suited to ppl who dont have as much music on it.",amazon
1/9/2016,Totally Great,amazon

6/17/2015,"I listen to music, as I take my daily walk. I chose this product, because the FM radio app was non-functional, and at times Pandora is unreliable. The Amazon MP3 app is amazing. It's always there! I like that I can create customized playlists--never had one before. The fact that music I buy from Amazon is downloadable to my electronic devices is truly slick. I purchasedd an MP3 player for one of my grandchildren, but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me. I'm not too savvy with apps anyway, but I am regularly discovering some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon, for making this free app available to your customers.",amazon
4/12/2013,really great selection & gteat to have all in 1 place.,amazon
6/8/2016,"On my Samsung Galaxy S4; this app will not play songs from Prime Music. Before the upgrade, I used this app extensively, and liked it. It now either freezes, crashes, or freezes and crashes every time I try to play any of the Prime Music songs. The songs in my library before the upgrade wokay fine. So essentially, Prime music has added zero songs for my enjoyment, and the app upgrade has brokayen the app. Well played!",amazon
6/16/2014,"Unable to use or get use out of it. All of Amazon Prime was so totally non-user friendly that I gave up for the second time and got my money back (again).

6/6/2016,A great service and well worth it. You can find most any kind of music with the exception of some older songs. Some great movies to watch though I haven't gotten a chance to watch a lot of them. Orders placed with prime arrived on time and no problems. I would recommend to anyone who likes to watch movies or listen to music and wants to get your orders in a couple of days.,amazon
12/2/2015,"This new update will not play music if no cell or Wi-Fi is available. My music is on my device and all I get is the rotating circle lookaying for service. However, I can play music through Google player, or the device's music player.
 
 I didn't even know about the lack of storage on my SD card. Every so often, I get a glitch and need to reset my phone. I should not have to re-download all my music. Before, I would pull my SD card, reset phone, and re-mount the SD card continue listening to music.

So, very frustrated I gave up and just went about my day and two hours later I get two emails one saying I used my reward and another charging me 98 cents.

I deleted the playlist and went back to Pandora which is dummy proof.",amazon

 USA is an international country with people speaking on more than 6 most common languages. Android (thanks to Google folks) kind of thought of this, so Android system is adjustable for any of more than 50 languages. I do not have any problems with &#34;ONLY ENGLISH&#34; programs working just fine on my &#34;RUSSIAN&#34; phone, but somehow in order to listen to Amazon MUSIC I need to change my phone's language to English... How music is related to language? Will Amazon Music program try to speak with me? Am I suspected not fluent in English if my phone is on different language settings? C'mon, Amazon, make yourself not limited to English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Chinese if you want to promote selling stuff like music - your competitor Google Music does not have such problems. Until this will be fixed, I would stay with Google.",amazon
1/29/2015,"I am unable to download purchased music to my phone/tablet. The only way to access is through the internet. I like to use my purchase music as ringtones and things.

I can purchase the album and download it that way.",amazon

5/5/2017,I did not think I would have to give more money to hear the music when I want to.,amazon
11/2/2017,Not overly user friendly. Lacks any serious interactive functions. Your downloaded music for offline listening has to be individually added to Playlist. There seems to be no way to modify the properties of the individual audio files to identify a song as a genre that you think it more closely resembles.,amazon
7/5/2016,This is an easy to use site. It provides a cloud for your music and also puts in all cds that you had previously purchased in the cloud which was great for my husband's phone. Thank you Amazon for another great service.,amazon
3/4/2014,I think it's great! Better than Pandora.,amazon
7/18/2017,Does what it says on the tin.,amazon
7/19/2017,"I'll vote in the mediocre as ""okay"" because that's all it deserves. The main drive for purchasing an Amazon Prime account was for the vast variety of bookays I can purchase and borrow for my Kindle. Otherwise, the Music app is below par. Clunky download/upload application and the service doesn't have access to thousands of old songs from certain labels. It's good for when playing/streaming music from my PC at home and that's about it.",amazon
2/6/2015,LOVE!!!!amazing,amazon
7/18/2017,"While this new version of Amazon Music holds mostly all of my music, it's not nearly as user friendly as the previous version.",amazon
10/25/2016,"Service seriously lacking many popular songs and artists that are available on other services. The stations are not varied enough and they don't sufficiently adapt to your thumbs ups/downs. App is weak as well. It's worth using since I already have Prime, but I wouldn't pay extra for this.",amazon
8/24/2016,The selection is incredible. The quality is top notch. Classical bundle varieties very educational.,amazon
3/30/2016,my biggest problem with this app is that it continually puts me on a screen wanting me to choose PRIME music. WHY IS THERE NOT AN OPTION TO SAY NO??? I don't have the access to internet that it would need to run it. Some of us don't live in a city where it's everywhere. I live in a rural area and my satellite internet is so much data per month. That's it. So PLEASE give an option to opt out of that without continually being routed back to that screen.,amazon
12/31/2014,"This used to be a great app. Now it sucks to use on a computer. It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music (my play list and stations or other playlists). Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point. I would've given it a 1, but I like that I can download my favorites playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle.",amazon
12/16/2016,"I'm so glad they brought back the lyrics. I thought they were gone after the most recent update but then there they were. Although I wish like with Google music, when listening to a station, you could see the list of song as they are about to play to customize better.",amazon

9/29/2016,Huge number of songs and type of music,amazon
4/5/2017,"As a long time Amazon Prime customer I cannot think of a time I have been more upset and hindered by a product in my life. I wokaye up today to find my cell phone off, once I powered it up I was greeted by rapid fire crash reports showing that prime music had crashed.

2/11/2017,"I have tried many music players like this in the past, and this is by far one of the most impressive ones.

All in all I am quite impressed with this product.",amazon
3/24/2016,"I really like the idea of unlimited music. The problem: it's not unlimited. For the annual fee, I expected to be able to stream any music I wanted. There are limits to the free music. Even older genres must be purchased. The ability to rewind and replay songs is excellent and a definite plus over regular streaming apps like Pandora, Milk, etc., but the complete freedom of free streaming apps is a plus over Amazon music.",amazon
4/17/2015,"I installed this app on my Kindle fire tablet and thought it would be something nice to have when I wanted to listen to some mp3 songs. It started to sync inmediately, and downloading songs. At first I thought they were some sample songs that normally come with new apps and services, but imagine my surprise when I found out that those songs belonged to CD's I had puchased in Amazon several years ago!! I didn't see anything during the app presentation before installing it that would tell me this was to happen, so this was a very pleasant surprise to me. Thank you Amazon !!",amazon

So, I've written this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly, but not the phone.

6/24/2014,"I think it's the best way to buy music these days. You have a selection of what you're lookaying for, then you get immediate delivery via download, house can burn your copy and then save the purchase unopened, if you want.

In most corporate setting employees are not given the choice of browsers they use or what programs they may install, which in this case means I can no longer listen to my purchased music at work. The compatibility with only the latest IE browsers or installing non-IE browsers in an imposibility. I understand Amazon is in the money-making business but some of the recent changes make me think customer service is no longera priority.",amazon

 Only recently acquired Amazzon Prime but wish I had got it a long time ago. Can also download music on my phone or tablet to listen offline.",amazon
12/8/2016,"The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate, and it does what it should. Performance though is a problem. I've used this on my HTC One M7, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S5.all of them have terrible performance. On wifi, it is just barely acceptable. Over 3g or even 4g, it takes an almost obscene amount of time to start streaming. This may be expected when on lower bandwidth connections, but it isn't just that it is buffering. It takes up 90 percent cpu time, impacting anything else I am doing. Seeing the same behavior on 2 M7s, plus the tablet and the S5,indicates it is an app problem. Initially I thought it was a side effect of the initial synching, but the problem continues days later.
 
 On the positive side, being able to download so you can listen offline is great. As I said, the app itself is easy and intuitive for the most part. If the performance can be addressed it will be a great app. As it is, it is relegated to occasional use.",amazon
6/1/2015,"I have HTC Rezound, and I don't know why, but this app does not work. I've updated it, reinstalled it completely and it still will not show my songs. If I flip back and forth (with the buttons) between store and music player/cloud, it will flash the song for half a second (I can see the album art), but there's no way to play it. My music just doesn't show up in the app. My husband also played with it, trying to get it to work, and had no more success than I.",amazon
11/6/2013,"After downloading the mobile app, and signing in to my Prime account, I attempted to stream music to my phone (Android). I was disappointed. It allowed me to download and play one album for free. However, two or three successive attempts to download albums in the Prime library failed, with only small samples being played before I was offered the opportunity to purchase.
 
 Admittedly, I didn't mess with it for long, since the moment called for music (streaming to a Bluetooth speaker) and I didn't want to take the time. So I went immediately to my Sirius Internet account, which worked perfectly. I'm sure that Pandora would also have worked easily, since it always has in the past.
 
 If I wasn't doing something properly, I would say that the site is not intuitive or user-friendly (at least for this Prime member).",amazon

6/14/2017,"This app hasn't blown me away or anything, but it does what it is supposed to. I ended up deleting it off my phone, but that wasn't because it was a bad app. My phone just doesn't have a lot of storage so if I find an app that I do not use often, I quickly delete them.",amazon
12/16/2012,i have always loved Amazon Music and used it on my Kindle every day for years. I have bought thousands of songs through it and now it's NOT COMPATIBLE with my Kindle or Amazon TV Stick. What's the point of having Amazon Prime if I can't even use it on my Amazon devices.,amazon

5/2/2017,"Great app. Just a small problem with offline music - online music that I download to listen to offline sometimes doesn't actually ""download"". Even though it's check-marked as downloaded, it won't let me play it and it gives me that annoying ""Internet connection required"". It's happened on my Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and an LG phone. Sometimes the lyrics are not on sync as well, or the art cover gets stuck for one song and the app 'freezes' (it keeps playing music but I cannot tap anything) a bit, then displays it correctly",amazon
11/14/2016,"I'm ticked. Amazon refuses to release an Amazon instant video app for other Android devices. Amazon is more than happy to take and use Android source, but refuses to support those of us that want to use a device that does more than just consume Amazon content. There are very few choices when it comes to video streaming sites and Amazon needs to get its head straight and start listening.",amazon
6/5/2014,I use Amazon Music with my Prime membership. I'm very happy with all of the ad free music available. One of the best features is the ability to download music to your device for offline playing. Amazon Music has a good variety of music available.,amazon
12/21/2016,"I have had this app for about 3 weeks and it continues to disappoint. Below are my major complaints.
 
 Won't shut off - if I pause the music, ope my recent apps and click the &#34;x&#34; button to close the app 9/10 times the music player opens itself back up, i have to do this 3 or 4 times to get it to close.
 
 Downloading music - it is great that you can download the Prime music, that is an awesome feature, however, if you only want certain songs from an album and you stop the other songs from downloading, the downloadet pops up everytime you use the app. It says the downloads are paused even though i have canceled the dow loads 12 times. I do not have unlimited data and do not want every song from the albums in question. On the topic of downloading songs, if you search for albums or songs and download them to your phone, often times it will not show them as in your library when you search again, so you can end up downloading several copies of the same song/album. There is not consistency between the music store and your local library.
 
 Glitchy - the app will often glitch when opening or closing and will not respond to commands. I have attempted two reinstalls and still no luck.
 
 Amazon really needs to get their heads together and fix this app, it has a lot of potential, but sucks the big one right now.",amazon
12/22/2014,"I'm listening to ""Hamilton"" the Broadway musical now. What more could I want? My daughters are grown and gone. Can't depend on them to keep me up to date in the music department. Amazon music will fill the bill! Great selection. Thanks Amazon Prime. ;-)",amazon

 The app is great, but since it is android and not BB, there is a hiccup once in a while that causes it to crash.

1/7/2017,"Considering the cost of a Prime Membership it would be nice to see more mp3 downloads for ""offline"" listening.

6/6/2017,"I was one of the early Prime subscribers, and generally am more than pleased by Amazon, their products and services, and usually have nothing bad to say about Amazon....
 However, that having been said, while I do enjoy Amazon Prime Music (APM) I am forced to uninstall it. It is a HUGE, space-consuming app! Let me elaborate: I've had this smart phone for just barely over a year. I don't download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l. APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly, in one of the folders within APM, I found numerous folders with names such as [500] and [47] and [200], etc. Within EACH of these numerous folders, I found the EXACT same images of album covers, (many/most of which I never played, viewed, downloaded, etc. - most were from the &#34;Recommended for you&#34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon, and the other suggestions, etc.,made by Amazon) Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images & data, there's apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary (space-destroying!) data! Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images & data, the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96[GIGABYTES!] -let me make this perfectly clear here, that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes, NOT Megabytes!! WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS & PLAYS MUSIC &#60;need&#62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!? This is absolutely RIDICULOUS, I *HOPE* someone at Amazon is reading this and lookaying into this...
 With APM installed, I was constantly receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work. That was correct, I missed phone calls, could not receive texts, etc., and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed. This includes my Android system OS, obviously, and virus/malware protection updates, ... and, just to be clear, this overwhelming space-consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files, and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!! Completely unacceptable, thus it gone, uninstalled. When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones (which are NOT huge space-storage devices, to begin with!), I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!",amazon

 I don't really use the video stream as I have Netflix - which the same thing - the netflix app is easier to use and more recent choices.

It proved to be better understood if being installed on the device that you intend to use it with. While I still have some questions about the use of this App, I like it because it allows me to play my music I have stored on the Amazon Cloud Drive without taking up the limited storage space on both devices. An imporvement in the instructions would be to state that you need to down load the App with the device on which you intend to use it. So far it is working well without too much difficulity.",amazon

4/6/2015,"I've had Prime since it was first offered years ago, simply because it seems I order everything from Amazon and, well, like to receive things as quickly as possible. I appreciated the Video's that came later included for members, but to be perfectly honest, the selection seemed limited and unexciting so I rarely use it. I noticed in passing, this new Prime Music and imagined it would also be woefully deficient so never bothered to try it. Until a friend mentioned it enthusiastically to me, so I just this week put the app on my Android. Who knew! I still haven't done a thorough testing after just a few days, but have been extremely impressed by the artists represented. Considering the price of pay music services, this alone covers the cost of Prime. Now, I would keep Prime and did have it long before any of the added offerings were tacked on due to the volume of things I order every year. But if your hesitating, or think this Music service might be a bare bones lame offering, do not hesitate. Loving it! What a nice added bonus to a service I already loved! (No, I don't work for Amazon! Just an honest and frankly unexpected appraisal.)",amazon

8/10/2016,"I'm a loyal Amazon customer, and have been for years. I was really excited when I learned that my Prime subscription included the music service. I was even more excited to use the new Amazon Prime Stations feature. I thought it would be great to no longer use Pandora's ad-laden app. Well, beyond the intrusive nature that Amazon apps have evolved into (seriously, Bezos, what's up with the lack of privacy?) that some others have commented on, the music app needs some help in its basic functionality. It's cumbersome to navigate the search feature (you have to be in just the right sub-area of the app to find what you're lookaying for). The stations would be great if there were a way at all to search or organize them. As it is now, there are so many stations (100's) and as far as I'm able to tell, they are not really organized in any way, rendering them much less useful. I'm not sure why there isn't a way to search the stations or at least save your favorite ones.
 
 Come on, Amazon! Step up your game with your app design!",amazon

8/30/2017,"Amazon Music gets 1 star for two reasons. First, because it seems I can no longer download MY music to the SD card on my phone. If I want to download music, it has to be directly to the phone. In the FAQ's in the app, it says that this option is available only on some phones that run lipop and KitKat. I just got a new phone that's running Marshmallow, so the option to download music to the SD card is grayed out. I don't choose to clog my phone up with music downloads, or alternatively use up my data streaming it. What is the problem, Amazon? Fix this.
 
 Another issue is that it no longer works with the current version of Ford Sync. There's an option in the app settings that lets Sync control the app through voice activation. If you check that box, Amazon Music crashes. Every single time. I contacted Amazon about this but got no response.",amazon

Try to play prime music automatically says I have to use this app and takes me a screen that just has a lovely little circle rotating and rotating ( an hour so far) and nothing. No music .

 Amazon- please go back to letting us download to our devices so we can use only 1 playlist!",amazon
7/4/2014,It is so easy and so many song to choose from that are free,amazon
7/30/2017,This app (on a Samsung G4) is very poorly designed. I still can't figure out how to close the app after I start it. There is an option (in the app) to clear the cache and this stops the player. But...why isn't there an option to close. Also (as others have mentioned) the songs are never actually downloaded. They stay in the cloud so you will use your data minutes every time you run it.,amazon
3/31/2015,I had this app & my phone sent me an update so I did it however after the update the app went away & I purchased a lot of music from you all through this app & now I have no way of retrieving it are you able to help with my issue,amazon
9/19/2016,Lack of music,amazon
6/6/2016,"The cool thing about the MP3 app is the Cloud service and the store has some of the music I listen to, is relatively cheaper than iTunes. Cloud service is cool. I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)
 
 Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix.",amazon
8/10/2011,It's kinda cool. It has feature like pre loaded Playlist based on artist or genre. I'm taking off one star because the random with the same style of artist isn't very good. Odd combination of artists and not keeping the same vibe sing after song... As an add-on to prime it's excellent.,amazon
4/25/2016,"I wish there were a way it would help me build playlists from my own music collection but aside from that, I like the service as a Prime member. I wouldn't pay the $10/month for a subscription service since I don't listen to that much music.",amazon

I paid for the upgrade to storage space, but it is not allowing me to upload my music from home. It worked for the bit that was on my laptop but it is just not an intuitive system at this point. As I paid for extra music storage space I am hopeful this is resolved soon, it could be a great way for me to store and listen to my music!",amazon

While both user interfaces are sluggish, Amazon MP3 player is by far the worse of the two....to the point of being unusable on my EVO 3d. There are extremely long pauses while browsing my collection and frequent force closes. I really would prefer the functionality and layout of Amazon's app, but the horrible lag in browsing the UI is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this app for large music collections. Instead, lookay at Google Music or Audiogalaxy (the latter only if you can leave your music collection pc on all day).

I do like the sample songs, but you have to keep pressing the new song when one is over, they don't just play, one after the other.

 It's on Rokayu for easy connection to a home surround system.
 
 You can add your own non-Amazon purchased mp3s and download the files to your drive of choice for further use.
 
 The player can be loaded onto multiple devices that all access your material.
 
 To sum up, this is a highly flexible and functional player. Recommend!",amazon
3/12/2013,"Prime Music is heaven for a music lover, and streaming through the website on my PC is easy.
 
 But the Android app is a thief. It keeps self-starting day & night, without authorization, using battery, running in the background no matter how often I ""Force Stop"" it or report it. I have a huge music library on microSD & flash drives & on my PC as well as in Amazon's cloud library.
 
 I can stream it through my Sony BluRay player to my with screen mirroring from my tablet - but I have to keep the tablet plugged in to keep playing for multiple hours. I don't bother from my phone, except for streaming music during dental work when I can connect, or on my phone during longish drives, plugged into the car charger.

2/16/2016,"I like the Amazon music service and the new Prime Music seems like a great idea, but when I discover new music and want to download it so I can listen to it without being connected it doesn't always work and is very frustrating.

I miss the old player so I use the standard player that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3",amazon

The site has been fairly easy to navigate even for a 50-something guy like me. Give it a try, I think everyone would find something they like on here.",amazon
8/17/2014,"Great product. We have had this for months now on our laptop and phones. It has kind of replaced iTunes and Pandora for us. Although my wife still listens to Pandora every once in a while.

8/1/2014,"I have enjoyed Prime Music's access to any hit I want anytime I want it. I have perused new music, classics--lots of genres. The one and only hitch I see is that it's not always easy to pull up older music. Simple to get new stuff though, and since it's usable on lots of devices it's quite handy.",amazon
2/4/2016,"I thought I loved you Amazon, but it turns out you're just like all the others...
 
 No, really, I liked Amazon because it delivered clean MP3's to my phone that I could transfer to my computer using simple drag and drop from the phone/pc directories. This is EXACTLY why I gave up my IPhone and went to Android, to then find out I had to boycott Google Play too, who, as it turns out, is even more insidious at highjacking your music.
 
 I just want to buy music and be in control of it. I want to be able to manipulate it. I don't want to use a third party cloud storage system. I trust my own ability to keep my music safely backed up,
 
 One last thing - Amazon was awesome too because it didn't conflict with my car's Bluetooth. My car would switch to voice control and back to music seamlessly which Google play never did but the Samsung music player did. Now Amazon, this messes that up again because now I have to get a 3rd party app to unencrypt all of my music on Amazon AGAIN and transfer it to my PC AGAIN, then move it back to my phone to use the stock music player so it works properly in my car.
 
 Yep, I'm divorcing you. So disappointed.",amazon
12/21/2016,Puts songs directly onto device storage. Needs an option for putting music directly onto the SD card. I've been downloading a few songs at a time and transferring them - a slow process. As for Prime music - it seems to hide it on the device storage with no way of moving to the CD card - My phone was running out of storage until I realized this.,amazon

1/11/2016,At this point and time I have to give it a bad review. The app worked great until an update would only play songs I had purchased from other apps none of the amazon prime songs would play! So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and now it comes up with a message that states my device cannot be authenticated! App won't even open now!,amazon
9/8/2015,Great app. Was able to easily get and download the albums I bought on Amazon. The app was automatically updated once I purchased the album and when I opened the app I could easily download the albums to my phone and tablet.,amazon

7/21/2015,"While I am a huge fan of Amazon music unlimited, i learned something by accident that I believe people need to know about! If you somehow log off the app or get logged off, all of your downloaded music goes away and you're forced to re-download it all, and like a previous reviewer said, there is no ""download all"" option so you need to download them individually. Amazon needs to warn people about this policy, or change it!",amazon
6/7/2017,"Aside from the free delivery, the movies that are presented are way outdated. And I already have Rhapsody, so I have no use for

10/19/2016,I am not able to get my Android device to play anything on Amazon Prime Music. My PC does fine though,amazon
8/15/2016,"the latest update (last week or so) destroyed my use of this app in the car.
 in the now playing screen, you used to ge able to swipe to go to next song, previous song.
 this latest update has that functionality, but when you swipe it pops up a context menu. WTF.
 then you have to click out of that to close it, and then swipe to get to next song.
 
 super lousy bug. that alone is causing me to lookay for another player.",amazon
6/21/2014,"Very complicated app to use, not user friendly. I use it anyway to get the free music included with prime, but it could be SO much better.
 -It's difficult to create and add music to playlists. Also it doesn't allow you to have the same song duplicate times on a playlist, so you can listen to it over and over again.(iTunes does, for example.)
 -Search function is crap. Many times I have typed the name of a song, album, or artist into the search bar, and it can't find what I'm lookaying for. But if I click and scroll around to find it, it's RIGHT THERE!
 -&#34;Repeat&#34; button doesn't work. It skips to the next song instead of playing it again.
 -Downloading music is weird... I always have to go back to the prime music store to double check to see if it downloaded. Sometimes it just doesn't show up under my device's music.
 There's probably more issues than what I've mentioned. PLEASE redesign your app, Amazon. I buy a lot of things off Amazon.com and I also use audible. With the amount of money I spend here, I should be getting a better app. And so should everyone else over here.",amazon
12/4/2015,Don't so much care that they are lookaying for the monthly fee for streaming now. That makes me rather sad. Miss it just being a part of my Prime. This doubles the cost of my Prime on an annual basis. Disappointing.,amazon
11/29/2016,"This new version has totally mixed my music covers, songs, titles and artist! I've done everything the has been recommended and nothing fixes it and you can't roll back to previous version! Unhappy with this App!",amazon
11/25/2016,still learning about it and is a great addition to my music.,amazon
9/24/2015,"I was disappointed at the effort required to get the music play on my phone. Difficult to get back to it as well. Perhaps I dont have the hang of it, but I do have other sites that I use without a problem.",amazon
1/31/2017,The phone app won't sync up with my account and keeps telling me to RE-BUY my prime membership.,amazon
9/2/2016,Just because they're isn't a zero star.,amazon
3/14/2017,Works better than I thought it would.....,amazon
3/14/2016,"Decent application, but does not have the selection of many of the other music streaming apps.
 Sound quality is good.
 Apparently, I was mistaken. There is comedy on amazon prime, but there is no way to search for it by genre. I find it irritating that I can only find comedians by searching for them by name. This needs to be improved.",amazon
8/5/2015,It's great I my taste in music is much different than most great fringe bands that what I like from metal to country if it's not on the radio it's for me. And when I search my favorite band there that are. Best music app around,amazon
1/30/2017,"I can understand how everyone want to make money off of things.
 
 But the whole splintering of things, just gets to the point of being annoying. Go to Itunes for this, Amazon for that, who knows whoever is going to come with the next new service. Same for video, Warner Brothers apparently pulling videos from Netflix, to form their own service.
 
 If they're going to ""DRM"" things, then there should be the equivalent of a DRM clearing house. If I ""buy"" an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I'm using online to listen to it. (Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?).
 
 Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.
 
 And of course speakers on phones suck.
 
 So, Music?
 
 I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another ""source"" of music.
 
 I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service. And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface (downloading), it worked okayay. But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.
 
 I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.
 
 So so so....
 
 If you use it, more power to you.",amazon
7/5/2013,I really enjoy listening to various songs that I downloaded.,amazon

6/20/2014,"I AM A CD MAN AND WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT MP3 MUSIC IN THE CLOUD. BUT, I AM
 GLAD AMAZON PROMPTED ME TO GIVE IT A TRY.
 THE SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL WITH BOTH MY
 BOSE BLUETOOTH AND SONY BLUTOOTH SPEAKER SYSTEMS. I HEAR NO DISTORTION IN
 MY MUSIC. AND IT MAKES CARRYING A WEEKS WORTH 60 HRS. OF MUSIC EASY & LIGHT!
 YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A COMPUTER WIZ TO USE THIS SERVICE. AMAZON'S CRACK CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ARE THERE IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.",amazon
1/28/2014,"I downloaded this app mainly for my kindle hd fire to begin with, I found it to be so easy to navigate and download my music purchases to my computer, now I find that I listen to my music on my kindle when I am out and about and on my computer at home hardly ever using my stereo now. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants music all in the one place both at home and when out and about .................",amazon
9/16/2014,"I like this app better than Google Play Music.
 
 Easy to use with a simple interface. This app runs perfectly on the Acer Iconia Tab A110-07g08u 7-Inch 8 GB Tablet (Gray).",amazon
6/21/2013,"Great but wish I could figure out how to play the different genres as a shuffle, since I like to listen to a mix of music. If I could figure out how to play Modern County, Top Hip Hop and Latin Pop would give 5stars.",amazon
8/1/2015,"Update 4/20/2015: Amazon listened. I can now listen to my music and I can say that the app is now pretty awesome.
 
 Unable to listen to any music-neither Prime or purchased. I have been currently (as I type) trying to listen to my music. It's been 15 minutes and no sound. It's still trying to load. I'd rather pay for an app and it work than to get it for free and it not. I don't hate Amazon or its service, only this app.",amazon
7/19/2014,Great music selection and everything runs without any issues,amazon
1/10/2017,Who doesn't like free!!! I got this digital bookay and so excited to read and show my kids the beautiful picture that comes with it. I use it as a supplementary material for there world history. It is easy to read and understand. Thank you so much for this opportunity to try your product.,amazon
1/28/2016,"I have only recently discovered Amazon Music, but the early indicators are that it is just what I was lookaying for. Quite a selection, at least as good as Pandora, and without the commercials. What a nice perk for having Amazon Prime. Which by itself has been money well spent.",amazon
3/10/2016,This app sucks. What's the point of prime music of the app constantly stops working 1/4 of the way through the first song! Forget about listening to any music you haven't purchased. Forget about listening to a different song after the first one stops working. I have to restart my phone to get a song to play after one freezes just to have a song freeze again!,amazon
4/15/2015,I am able to find almost any song I can think of and I am able to listen to the music on any of my devices. I just start at one song and let it play from there,amazon
5/15/2017,If I put none I would have,amazon
5/24/2017,Prime music was great when I first got it several months ago. But now it stops playing at least once during every song. I have uninstalled and rebooted it several times with no improvement. I have AT&T as my carrier and am not sure if they have slowed my data speed. I am NOT happy with Amazon Prime Music!,amazon
6/16/2016,No longer compatible with my device so I can't give it anymore than one star. Was awesome when it worked though.,amazon
10/21/2014,Used now for a few weeks. Seems to be a good quality app for music. User friendly,amazon
12/24/2015,"The only thing this needs is the ability to 'go back' and change a rating for a song. IE: If I ""thumb down"" a track, it'll remove it from play. So, if you accidentally hit the 'thumbs down,' you're potentially removing a song you don't mind or even like from being played indefinitely, with no way of retrieving it.
 
 I sent a message to Amazon in this regard and received a ""we'll send your concern on to the development team,"" but never received a follow-up.
 
 Otherwise, it works great! Good selections, convenient to use the 'cloud' to play on different devices.
 
 My wife wishes we could share playlists/accounts. And it'd be great if you had a ""family"" Prime where each member could access the added features of Amazon Prime Music, Instant Video, etc.",amazon
1/29/2016,Every song you can think of.,amazon
8/2/2017,"UPDATE:
 I got a new Samsung S3 and it seems to work really well on this phone, not sure if it was an update to the app or if it just works better on my new phone but the app didn't work before on my Evo 3D
 
 I don't know what they've done to it, but now on my htc evo 3d 4g the widget will not go on the screen, even if the home screen is empty it says there is not enough space. The shortcut in the menu disappears so if you don't make a shortcut on one of your home screens you will be unable to open the app unless you open it from the appstore. It used to work decently, now its completely non functioning. How can I use the app when I can't even use a widget or shortcut to open it? If they at least fix that I'd at least raise it back to like 4 stars.",amazon
1/7/2014,Best music program out there. Not only can I upload all of my own music and listen to it anywhere prime ha's more music than I could ever listen to. I can also utilize up to 10 devices. Play what you want when you want. No restrictions and to me it's free because I'm gonna pay for prime no matter what so it's a win win! !!,amazon
9/1/2015,delivers most of the music I like for free and its getting a lot easier to manage your music for play back and its more fun to ask Echo (alexa) to play an album or certain single song provided its in my library.,amazon
8/8/2015,"It might just be me, but the app will take some getting used to. It's a great product, though!",amazon
3/12/2015,I have this on my Galaxy Note 4 and it is great. I especially like it because it gives me the ability to use my GPS tracking app when doing my walk or Bike ride and still listen to music without haveing to carry a second device.,amazon
9/7/2016,needs to get some music little faster availability but still great selection of songs and artists,amazon
1/16/2017,"If you purchase the music, it immediately downloads directly into your specific Playlist of choice. But, if you use the free Prime option, the songs download to ""Never Land"" & you can't retrieve them easily. It's a debacle!",amazon
6/1/2015,"Well-intentioned but definitely seems to be in a beta version if you will. Could use a car mode, voice commands, and compatibility with S-voice and/or car mode on Samsung Galaxy for optimum usefulness. Thankful for this arm of the Amazon Prime experience!",amazon
5/22/2016,"The good: It installed easily and doesn't crash my Android 2.3 phone (LG MyTouch Q).
 
 The not-so-good: Mediocre variety and selection of music, at best. No obvious way to use Amazon.com MP3 credits. No idea what happened to the song I selected and thought I downloaded.",amazon
9/6/2012,"App works well. Prime Music itself is great. Cloud access on any device. Only complaint is that there's some stuff unavailable on Prime unless you pay extra, but I guess that's just how Amazon does it.",amazon
9/1/2017,"Will not update, keeps kicking out of the update with an 505 error, otherwise, this is my go to app for my music.",amazon
6/17/2016,"This streaming music service is perfect for all of our listening needs -- from the patio to the car and everywhere in between. Once in a great while there will be a hiccup, but for my money it can't be beat.",amazon
11/21/2016,"This used to be a serviceable option for those of us not in iPhones, but now with their new streaming music service Amazon seems to be rapidly abandoning the non-streaming portion part of their music service. They're making it hard to upload your own music and their phone app is draining my battery at an alarming rate even when I don't use it. Time to start migrating to another service before their service crashes all together and you can't even get your music from it anymore.",amazon
11/21/2016,"I tried repeatedly to use this service but when I went to pay for the product it wouldn't allow the payment stating that it couldn't complete the transaction.
 Finally I got tired of trying to deal through Amazon and went and bought the music through another retailor without the slightest issue.",amazon
11/23/2015,I just joined Prime and so far it is great. I wish that there was a way to randomly sort music that is loaded.,amazon
6/24/2016,Won't work on my country. Only cheap covers.,amazon
1/5/2017,I downloaded one album and it doesn't work right. Constantly skipping and pausing and jumping around. Very annoying. I deleted it almost immediately from my kindle.,amazon
12/20/2013,Great music selection and easy to locate any sing in lookaying for. Amazon is a great service and I receive it free thru Amazon Prime.,amazon
6/26/2016,A little bit strained getting to what you want to listen to on the Amazon Echo.........but overall I like it.,amazon
6/26/2016,I replaced Pandora with Amazon Music and the selections are much better and the quality of the audio is superior.,amazon
6/13/2016,"It would be a lot better, if more songs fell under the umbrella of Prime Music. Instead of having to resort to Unlimited music",amazon
7/26/2017,"The newly updated music app for Amazon is pretty good. If you are a Prime member/subscriber, you get access to a good amount of free music. All you have to do is update the app and then you get access to ""Add"" songs to your library for free. Then, you can listen to the songs in the order you want and how you want. No ads and no skip limits! Not all new songs are available yet, but the selection is pretty good. Also, the app has settings that let you decide what quality of music file or streaming you want to use (to save on data if you are using your phone's plan). You also get the option to download the songs over WiFi and listen to them later without using up your data plan.
 
 A nice feature is the option to listen to preset playlists based on type of music or mood that you are in. The songs from the playlists are free (if you have Prime).
 
 App works well, and it is great if you have Prime! I would recommend it.",amazon
6/12/2014,The stations are great and stays on track a lot better than other music apps I've tried.,amazon
4/28/2017,if I can do it anyone can doit,amazon
11/10/2016,Too limited and disorganized on the site,amazon
6/7/2017,Amazon Music is super and very user-friendly. I am extremely pleased with it. Use it all the time.,amazon
4/28/2017,"The mobile app is pretty good. The site and the desktop app ui needs some work; very beta feeling. Also ran across some music that was encoded at poor quality. The download feature is really nice since I have a limited data plan and free with my prime membership is pretty cool. Lookays like the business model is to give you just enough free music to get you to use it, but with holes in collections to get you to purchase more.
 
 They do alow you to upload some of your music, but we still have yet to find the one app/service that will have everything. I currently use 5 now...",amazon
12/2/2015,It's great! No commercials. Outstanding sound quality. Numerous choices for songs and playlists.,amazon
4/16/2015,I found it a bit confusing to use at first.,amazon
8/1/2017,"This takes a little time to figure out how to use on my cellphone. It was a little confusing.
 
 After I finally got the app to work (on my cell) I was listening to music on my PC and then tried to listen to the same stuff on my cell. I got a notice saying you can only listen to one at a time.
 
 For some reason I had a little trouble setting it all up, but I think I now have it.
 
 I like the idea that I can choose from a huge list of music and then transfer it to my phone. HOWEVER, I wish these were MP3's so I could put them on a CD. That would rate this as a 5.",amazon
6/20/2014,It would be nice to be able to mix all of the music up together instead of just country or just rock or just 80's or just 90's,amazon
4/16/2017,It's nice that I can download some of the music and listen when I don't have WIFI.,amazon
4/22/2015,"This is great, my only question is why is every-time I Iisten there is a loud squelch in the speakers about 30 - 60 seconds into the first song? To save your hearing my advice is to start the app, play a song, wait a minute then put in your headphones.",amazon
5/21/2016,App only works about half the time. It likes to refuse to play downloaded music. Glad I'm not paying extra for it.,amazon
6/6/2016,"1 ) App used to lookay good, now it's an eyesore.
 2 ) When I updated to the new version, it decided to automatically load all of my music files from the HD even though I had this turned off on the old version. An hour after launching the program, it came up, indexing the thousands of wav files I use for music production. Great. Unchecked the load from windows media player again, the library was back to normal. Now today, it decided to load the entire WMP library again because it felt like it. This program isn't worth it anymore.",amazon
12/4/2016,I was so excited to find this app so i could enjoy my prime music on the go but sadly it sucks. Yes i can download music on the go but it doesnt help when the music wont play or starts buffering and never recovers. I sure hope it will be better in the future,amazon
4/27/2016,I enjoyed having music I purchased on amazon on my prime music,amazon
9/7/2015,"I never used the app, I thought I could listen to the music in my car like I do on my computer. But I'm not gonna pay an extra monthly charge for it, I'll just stick with my xm radio.",amazon
6/3/2017,Constantly autostart with no ability to stop it from happening. Minimal music sorting features. Errors downloading large music collections and have to restart download.,amazon
9/29/2017,"Didn't like having to side load the Amazon App Store in order to get Music. App navigation takes some getting used to. Prime surprised me by having some less mainstream material available. However, some of the more mainstream artists I like are not currently available on Prime. That's the biggest reason for the mediocre rating.",amazon
6/16/2014,"NO COMMERCIALS!
 Download this, spend a little time searching for your favorite music and if you are a member of Amazon prime there is a good bit you can save to the cloud for FREE and play anytime WITHOUT COMMERCIALS! the more music and wider variety you add, the more suggestions for new music you will get. Even has a setting so the only items you will see are FREE with prime. This app is perfect.
 Thank you, Amazon.",amazon
6/12/2014,"The app I hate the most. Terrible user interface. Would not let me play music I downloaded to my phone from Amazon Music without signing in with my e-mail address and password. HUH?! This was finally fixed in an update, but still horrible, tiny menus that can not be read at a slight distance (I.E. used in a car) and are completely un-intuitive. The app will ALWAYS try to play Prime Music streaming instead of music on your phone. Hello wasted data $$$. Some artists/songs that I purchased do not show up in different views (title/genre/artist/album). The original app was fine, when Prime Music was added they ruined it.",amazon
2/21/2015,"The prime music service is great. However the app needs improvements. It's clunky, many links into deeper pages are text only when a button would be nicer. You cannot add items to your library without tapping them first, where a long press should be able to give that option.",amazon
6/12/2014,"Impresive benefit as Prime member. Playlist simplicity, HD quality. Truly enjoyed endlessly with no commercials.",amazon
4/20/2015,I can't get the app to install from Google play or Amazon app,amazon
11/23/2016,I am unable to download to my Android phone. No help available.,amazon
9/30/2017,"Easy to use, tremendous library!",amazon
6/12/2017,No adds lots of music just doesn't have all the bands i lookay for or it would be 5 star,amazon
6/9/2017,"Good Music, Good Selection, Always on point when I need it (mobile offline or online).",amazon
10/1/2017,"This player is awesome. I tried about 3 other players before deciding on this one. Amazon's player allows me the feeatures I like. It opens to my library, which some other player don't do. I really like that it defaults to my library because I don't use the player for radio.",amazon
2/1/2016,use it every day!!,amazon
5/15/2017,found it difficult to download my music as there were no clear instructions as to how to download them and not knowing that i needed an internet connection to access my purchased music infuriated me,amazon
12/14/2016,Enjoy playing music with this app,amazon
4/15/2016,All you need for prime,amazon
9/8/2017,It needs more variety. Of music. And mix music too.,amazon
4/28/2017,"Music when I want it, great! ??",amazon
9/21/2017,"Lots of good music, some free, some not. I like that I can listen to any music that I had purchased, even when bought on CD. Amazon automatically provides a digital copy of any music you buy. Only three stars as the app is not that easy to navigate. But overall pretty cool.",amazon
2/9/2016,Didn't work in Portugal,amazon
6/24/2017,"I had a galaxy note 3 and had a playlist, however I got a new phone and not one song from the playlists that i spent hours creating appear on the new phone.",amazon
1/7/2016,You most certainly get your money's worth as a Prime customer! Forgetting to cancel my 30 day free trial is one of the best things I have ever done. :),amazon
5/3/2017,Amazon has a great selection to choose from. Much easier to use than most music Apps! I highly recommend!! :),amazon
6/12/2016,"I like the idea, and I used to praise the app. Recently however Amazon apps have become hogs of data and battery. I don't know why. But I don't see any good reason for Amazon Music to be running at all after a complete reboot, much less becoming the highest user of data and battery!!!
 
 A recent update seems to have calmed it down a bit, so I'm giving it another chance.",amazon
11/28/2014,"I've really enjoyed exploring new music and being able to download it to my device, I don't think it has the volume button skip capability even the screen is off that I enjoy as part of Google Play, it also will just turn off occasionally forcing me to reopen the app which is annoying and is dangerous/should not be done when driving. (Note 4)",amazon
5/12/2015,"Really like so far, way better than Pandora...
 I would ask that they give the stations a way to play clean versions of the song ..",amazon
6/13/2017,"Simple, it doesn't work. I paid for music and cannot play it. Only works upon reboot but the problem eventually returns. Tried all different parameters; WiFi on/off, Bluetooth on/off, problem persists. Used to work just five until update so I know this is Amazon's fault.",amazon
12/15/2014,"Easy to use, let the good times roll...",amazon
7/18/2017,I only gave it 3 stars because I was hoping my grandson would be able to replace his spotify account with it and save me $10 a month. He tried it and said it is like the prime movie choices. Limited to what is free and the rest you have to pay for. I have to agree there so it really don't quite hit the mark.,amazon
9/16/2015,"None better that I have discovered. Hassle free, straight up MP3 downloads, now with prime, much of it free as well.
 Any other site you are going to pay for
 every tune you select. Although things are
 beginning to change as I recently discovered when my music library was
 destroyed by nasty gov.agency...one
 wonders who would that be with some
 initials like ASN? Could that be asinine?",amazon
7/19/2014,Excellent selection.,amazon
7/23/2017,"I have not even dented this service, but so far, it is pretty darn cool. After adding Prime, it got even better. It is so good, I purchased a tablet, just to store and listen when not at home.",amazon
2/5/2017,Good but not as good as pandora or YouTube Music.,amazon
8/7/2017,all my music on my phone! very convenient and easy to use and so on and so forth and here's more words to make up the 14 more required.,amazon
4/19/2014,Interface is easy to use. There is a pretty good selection of music with the prime membership.,amazon
9/2/2017,Amazing!!! There is an assortment of music right at your fingertips. I can even go back and play my favorite songs again and again and again! I'm loving that! Good bye Pandora! I've found a new Music App to call Home!awesome,amazon
9/7/2016,Amazon has a very easy to use and an extensive library. They do a fantastic job at making the artists and generas easy to find and download. With cloud there is no way to run out of space. Customer service is top notch.,amazon
9/7/2016,Best music app since the last update with stations for ios.,amazon
5/25/2015,I have just begun mining the huge collection Prime can associate with one's musical interests- in my case classical and ancient music. If Amazon can do that surely a more modern assortment must be vast.,amazon
8/6/2015,This works so good on my weekend workouts at the gym. Great playlists when you don't know what to listen to. huge library so if you know what you like you can accumulate. I didn't know this was a feature of prime till after I got prime. Sooo this will make sure I stay a prime member for a long time.,amazon
10/17/2015,With the membership...BEST MUSIC ON THE INNERWEB....????awesome I just got out of the hospital after a heart transplant and it was great to listen to music. .what i wanted ..not like that other station i not mention...thanks again?,amazon
8/4/2016,"Amazon prime is great, as I buy a ton if stuff off of amazon. The prime instant video selections is not too good. I wish there was a way to filter what is paid and what comes free with prime. Prime music is nice, but the playlists are so small. My favorite part is free 2 day shipping, that's super nice and handy. Makes buying easier",amazon

10/29/2017,"Dear Amazon, maybe this will get your attention... If I can't store music on my SD card on my phone, I can't buy any more music, because I can't store it all, and can't stream on a plane... I'm a dedicated prime member.... PLEASE CHANGE THIS PROGRAM TO STORE MUSIC ON THE SD CARD. I just bought a 64 gb card from amazon to store all my music and it sits there empty.
 Very, Very Disappointed by this.",amazon
8/26/2014,"it plays music well, selection seems to be pretty good, and eventually you can find what you want, but the dark and crowded navigation screens are hard to use in the car/bus/train. it also takes too many clicks to get to where you want to be.
 
 suggestions:
 - completely mute (or pause) the music when a text or other notification comes in, or when the GPS tries to talk - right now i can't hear most text notification sounds over the music, and can just barely hear the GPS directions (google maps) over the music.
 - add optional light/dark themes to fit different peoples' tastes and environments
 - add a FAVORITES section so i can have all my stations, playlists, tracks, etc in one place instead of scattered all over. more than once i've had to really search around for a station i had listened to a while ago, that was no longer listed in ""recents"".
 - add a CAR MODE with bigger buttons/text so it's easier to use - this would be especially useful for those of us with android car stereo units like this one: HIZPO Quad Core Android 5.1 Car DVD GPS for Toyota RAV4 2006-2012 with 1024x600 Capacitive Touchscreen support Steer Wheel Control Screen Mirror OBD2 TV DVR Stereo Bluetooth SD USB Radio Player",amazon

It also searches Amazon for information about each MP3 as they are being uploaded. And I'm sure they covered every file type know. Amazon again keeps you up to date with the latest tech. It's ease of operation is quite simple. If you want things more complicated here, lookay elsewhere. It's perfect for everyone from 8 to 80. Excellent product.",amazon

However, it provides all the same features as it's largest competitor, do if you haven't already invested a significant amount of time creating an online music collection elsewhere, then I highly recommend thinking about this service.",amazon

7/15/2015,App works fine. No problems after many months.,amazon
2/16/2017,"I like Prime Music, especially the prime stations. So much ""free"" music (with your $99/year membership). I like the app, on my Windows desktop. I don't like the app on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) for 3 reasons. First, because you can only listen to three sources: Amazon Prime Music, your Amazon Cloud music, or music in your device storage. If you have a lot of MP3s, you either have to forget about them, add them to the cloud for a fee, or try to find them in Prime Music. If I had the ability to access music from a uSD card, I'd give the app at least 4 stars. As it is, it barely qualifies for 3. Second, you can't stream from the app to a wifi stereo receiver like with iTunes Airplay, and Chromecast is not available like it is for so many other apps. Third, the prime stations are absent from the Android (and the Rokayu) app. What's up with that? One of the best things about the Windows app is absent from the Android app? I've purchased a lot of songs from both iTunes and Amazon MP3, and even a few from Billboard and other sources. The Amazon purchases are available, the iTunes and others are not. I don't want to pay a second fee for cloud storage of all my music on top of the Prime membership just to listen to something I purchased elsewhere. I'm only able to access about half of my music with this app. Make it so I can have all my music on a uSD card and play it through this app, and I'll revisit my score.",amazon
7/19/2015,Can't get anything out pop,amazon
5/4/2017,"Very disappointed in this ""Unlimited Music"" plan. I have been an Amazon Prime member for years and really liked ""Prime Music."" When The new plan came out my choices of free music seemed to be greatly reduced, now I have to buy everything I want to add, not to mention the dropping off of songs I have already saved unless I want to purchase them. So I decided to try the ""Unlimited Music"" plan. So far it seems the songs I want are not FREE but have to be purchased. So how can this be Unlimited Free Music? I have read I can pay 10$ a month or 120$ per year and find a new music source. With Amazon Prime I pay 100$ and an added 80$ for ??? Add that together with the fact that many of the items I have been purchasing through Prime are more expensive than from other sellers on the internet I think I am about done with Amazon. Wish it wasn't so.",amazon
5/11/2017,I was dissapointed that the sound quality of the recording was extremely poor. This was probably associated with creating the mp3 recording. Amazon did refund the money but I would question if there is any quality control an if this problem will happen again. I will probably stick to cds.,amazon
11/21/2015,Takes a while to learn how to navigate through Prime Music which makes it difficult to use. You have to work at it to understand it but all in all I am starting to use it more since I downloaded the app for my phone.,amazon
9/5/2016,Preinstalled on my new HTC One M9 on VZW. App began crashing before right after I signed in and never stopped.

7/4/2016,"A great add on for prime users, have found most (not all) the music I have been lookaying for. It was obscure tracks either. The interface could be a bit easier.

3/29/2016,"For Version 4.0.4 - App gets the job done, and handily let's you access all content. However, player seems too simplistic to me, and more importantly, there is no option to deactivate the app's checking for cloud songs every ten minutes. This deficiency causes the app to monopolize mobile data.
 
 Recommend adding an option to toggle off the constant cloud checks, and improving player interface.",amazon
7/24/2014,"I enjoy listening while I work. Only one issue but, it might be with my Surface and not necessarily with Amazon Music. It takes a while for the music to stream. I have to repeatedly select before it starts loading. Once it starts, it's good all day!",amazon

6/14/2016,"This is a great App to keep all the music you've purchased with Amazon together. I live overseas, so it's even more important that I can use this in an offline mode without a network. I was able to download my playlist to be used when I wasn't on wifi. I just got back from a month traveling, and it was great to have my favorite music on planes, trains and subways no matter what I was up to.
 
 After I downloaded the app it grabbed all the music I've purchased over the years on Amazon. I didn't have to go lookaying for them, I can play by artist, or album, but usually I shuffle through my entire library. The app also doesn't drain your battery while playing music which is nice. It's been working beautifully.
 
 I am using the app on a Nexus 5 phone",amazon

12/18/2016,"Having the ability to stream music on your phone directly from the cloud is convenient. It eliminates the need to manually transfer mp3 files from your computer to your phone. I have an aux input jack that I use to connect my phone to my car stereo, and the audio quality is better than that of Pandora. I have a JBL audio system I installed aftermarket, and so I can hear the difference between a high quality stream and one that has been compressed to save bandwidth. While not CD quality, the audio quality is still excellent.
 
 Caution: the app does use mobile data, so if you have a limited data plan, that is something you might want to watch out for. The app does remind you every time you use it unless you disable the notification. If you're like me, you probably have because you don't want to have to click okay every time you open the app.",amazon

I wish you could download your cloud playlists independent of the songs, but I suppose that's a moot point, unless... If they could make it so that anytime you are playing something from the Cloud, if it would automatically play the next song in the queue from your device if it's on your device, and then switch back to the Cloud for whatever isn't on the device, now that would be cool.

Really?
 I'm sorry Amazon, but you need to do better than that to be considered a full-fledged music service.

 Second, it's hard to find a specific album... let's say the Doobies Greatest hits and get it to save to your device. Next time, the danged app kicks up a recommendation instead and gives you ""playlists"" of groups similar to the Doobies.

10/25/2016,"This app is great. You can find any music you want. It's not free for every song, but a lot are. You can also stream stations of genres of music you like, which is fun. Cool extra to having a prime membership.",amazon
7/28/2016,Basically iTunes for Android. I prefer the music player over the one the phone came with or any that I have downloaded.,amazon
7/3/2013,"Not that easy to use. Crashes my samsung android phone. Player won't work properly on my Surface tablet. But, I actually do like having access to the music I have purchased as CDs as digital media. I also enjoy having access to some of the music Prime has available for no extra purchase. It works best on my PC.",amazon
6/8/2015,"So far the selection of music is pretty good, lots of 50's and 60's Jazz. There are some issues between the my phone and Amazon music player but my other devices don't seem to have the same problem(s), otherwise I would have given Amazon five stars.",amazon
2/27/2016,"Great app. I can't believe all the songs you can download for free. I have 389 songs and their all stored in Amazon's cloud so no matter how many I download, I'm not using any space on my device. It's worth every penny for $99.00 a year.",amazon
4/22/2016,Works great no complaints so far.,amazon
6/2/2017,"I've used Pandora, Iheart radio, and Google Play.

I like that I can get channels with my Prime membership, but this app does not have a way to save favorite channels. It shows recently played channels, but that only gets in the way when you are experimenting. It really needs ""Favorites""",amazon
5/17/2015,"Great app, allows loading to my Note 4 seamlessly, because Apple has made it an incredible nuisance to transfer files from a Mac to Android phone.

6/6/2016,Works great but there isn't a very large selection of music or artist. If just listening to the mainstream artist and songs is good enough for you than so is this. The good thing about this is that there isn't a buffer or annoying load time between or beginning of songs,amazon

Then about 6 hours after I first got the &#34;Prime&#34; song I tried to play it again and the app said it was no longer available, then removed it from my list. Lame!

 The only way I was able to recover was by recreating those playlists from scratch.
 Note to engineering, need to test your product with new OS releases ahead of the release.
 I'm guessing this problem will be resolved in future Android updates. Nonetheless, that's a bit of a dissapointment.",amazon
1/14/2014,The app doesn't allow you to play a Prime playlist without first copying it into your library. The only thing you can do with one without copying it into you library is listen to samples. I'd much rather listen to the whole thing (perhaps skipping songs) and then copy it to my library if I like it. There are too many steps and too many delays in the current implementation.,amazon

6/16/2014,"This is all about David Bowie right now.
 
 Amazon did a great service in making sure Black Star was listenable for free. I'll grant that. They didn't have to, and that's a credit to them.
 
 But given that he'd just died, maybe for a few days you could have put his Greatest Hits up for free? Because honestly it feels like a cash grab otherwise. If I now want to listen to Bowie I've got to buy it from you? Yes I know music is commercial, but this is a free music service we're talking about here.
 
 I'll gladly shell out for Bowie's greatest hits - a day or two or a week from now. Right now? Might you not have just done a service to fans and put some stuff up for free? For a few days, and then ended it? Wouldn't that have been the high minded thing to do?",amazon

3/12/2015,This is a Great benefit of Prime! I like Country music and there is a lot of country music to choose from. Of course there is also Many other types/genres to choose from. Much of the music can be downloaded to listen to.,amazon
3/14/2016,"I really wasn't sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it's just okay since the app is not all that bad (lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet) and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I'd have to stay with 3 stars.
 
 Issue #1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I couldn't move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can't play any prime music, but that's okay because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.
 
 Issue #2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that didn't make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I'm sure there are many more. Disappointing.",amazon

Upon attempting to download 10 files from Amazon Cloud, I was presented with a message ""Linux only allows one file to be downloaded at a time. Please checkmark only 1 file and try again.""
 
 Does that mean my entire Amazon Cloud library must be downloaded to my Nexus 7 one file at a time? How Neanderthal! I know I can stream Amazon Cloud music files, but streaming is not available when traveling the subways.",amazon
8/3/2012,Way better than iTunes. Switched to amazon almost 10 years ago and I have bought my music exclusively from them ever since. I have an iphone and I use amazon music player never itunes,amazon
8/10/2016,It is skipping/stuttering music that has been downloaded to my device. It spins continuously instead of actually playing music streamed from the cloud. It quickly consumes resources on the device to the point that I have to restart the device to gain back control.,amazon
7/29/2014,"Did not ask for it and do not know who authorized purchase. Only thing good was it was free. If it was automatic due to 30 day free trial of Prime, then it should say so. This way, people do not think their account has been breached.",amazon

6/14/2016,Lookays like a great Product !,amazon
6/4/2015,As a prime user it has a lot of music to choose from. I've always found what I'm lookaying for. I also like the fact that I can listen to a huge Playlist offline.,amazon
11/10/2016,"App lookays great and seems intuitive. Why 3 stars? No option to move cached prime music (downloaded for offline listening) to external SD card. Instead the app fills up valuable space on your internal device storage with encrypted media files. I'm not sure why they do this. It can't be for copy protection since anyone can easily copy the cached music (m4a files). The files are encrypted and useless without playing them through the app as designed.
 
 Other major problems:
 - no automatic volume normalization. Who wants to constantly turn the volume up and down with every song?
 - ""preview album"" function for listening to music I would potentially buy doesn't work reliably. I have to amazon.com through a browser and preview there.
 - Cannot read reviews of songs/albums. It shows how many stars and how many reviews, but does not take you to any reviews if you try to click on them",amazon

7/29/2016,"Simply amazing. Ive been a prime member for years but finally switched from a KF HDX to a samsung tab as the fire tablets after the 3rd gen HDX became low cost budget tablets more so then they were.
 The app though offers a lot for prime music members and is very user friendly. Works perfectly on any device. Its even slightly easier to navigate then the inherent music app on the kindle devices themselves, due to an update on those devices that makes it more difficult to switch from online to offline downloaded songs. Great app!
 P.s - I still have my hdx, but mainly use it for music, as the sound is still better on my 3rd gen hdx than my newest galaxy tab s2, even through headphones",amazon

9/11/2016,I am not a misic junkie. I Dont have spotify or itunes and stuff...I use Google's all access...its better for me. This service would be great if it offered the same volume of songs as Google. I use Google to pick up current songs to play as I write fiction. My most inspirational songs are all free on Google. Out of 86 Amazon had 10 free. Not worth it honestly.,amazon
6/17/2014,"The old version worked great, and I could move between songs without having to open the album song list. On this one, there are buttons all over the place on my phone that SAY I can move forward or backward between songs [lock screen, a swipe on my lock screen, the notice screen, and even the ""now playing"" screen inside the app], but they don't work, either on the phone itself or while using it through Bluetooth. The only way I can change songs is to open the song list, but if I want to listen to my current song again, I have to change songs first. This is beyond annoying! And having to open a song list while operating a car is not only dangerous, but ILLEGAL in my state. I also cannot turn off the music by using the pause button on the lock screen of my phone as I previously was able to do. This is a basic loss of functionality that surely should have been tested for before releasing it to the public. It makes me regret downloading the update.",amazon
6/18/2014,"I really like Amazon Music w/ Prime, if for no other reason than I can take my phone in the car and play music I like, instead of relying on my old factory installed radio, .

4/29/2016,Met all expectations,amazon
9/29/2016,Nice Prime music selection and nice pre-made playlist but the app is terribly slow. I like the lyrics part and the radio with unlimited skips as well as the radio stations. I like the option to be able to download playlist to use offline. But the player doesn't work when I turn off all my radios. How do I know it's really offline music then? After listening to music for a random period of time the music will just stop playing. I'll pause it and play it again for it to work for only another few minutes till I have to completely close and re-open the app. Not really sure what this BlackBerry/Amazon deal was but it sure was more in Amazon's favor then BlackBerry users. Amazon tookay over BlackBerry music and video services but brought slow faulty ported apps to in place of it all.,amazon
6/26/2015,With all the good music services out there - this is a weak contender. You can't download and save and it takes up WAY too much memory on a phone for just being a player. It gets one star rather than zero since Prime members get it free. The download process from the Amazon store for Android has too many steps. It's easier from the Google store.,amazon

9/29/2016,"My wife and I started having problems this past Sunday with Amazon Music Store, which she has been using for a month. On Monday, I replaced her old Moto X with a new Moto X, same gen, installed Music Store again, and started downloading all her music. Downloads were slow and practically overwhelmed my wifi with upstream requests. On Tuesday, all the downloaded (Offline) music files on her phone, about 700, were corrupted. On Wednesday, all the downloaded music files on my phone, about 300, were corrupted. On Thursday, tech support helped me figure out how to download the files again, because up to that point, Music store wouldn't let me download music files again. On Friday, my wife and I were driving 14 hours to Seattle. We verified that, even though we were playing only offline content, the app was still burning through my Verizon data plan. Her phone went through my entire monthly allotment in less than half a day. So I turned off data plan data. Amazon acknowledged the problem, said it's working on a fix, but has not yet offered any fixes. On Saturday, all the free content on both our phones was corrupted again, along with some of the paid content. For literally days worth of trouble, Amazon offered a $5 coupon. It's now Tuesday, eight days later, and this review won't change unless I hear from Amazon. If you're traveling somewhere and want to take your music with you, DON'T depend on this app.
 It's now Thursday, 10 days later, and the latest attempt to download music resulted in nothing but corrupted files. Interestingly enough, all the files I paid for are good this time, but all the prime free content is corrupted.
 So far so good. A new update installed, as of July 10, and we've gone two days without losing prime music. And just in case I didn't make this clear, the last two times the downloads were corrupted, only Prime music was affected, not the purchased music.
 I take it back. All the ""free"" music that I downloaded from Amazon for my wife is corrupted again. Am I paranoid to suspect that Amazon doesn't want its Prime members downloading and listening to free music. Why is it that only the Prime music downloads get corrupted, while the albums I bought remain playable. What is the point of offering free music if you then take it away after two or three days?",amazon
7/7/2015,Seems to work well. I have used it often..,amazon

3/13/2017,Downloaded the app to listen to music under my Amazon Prime account and it will not play anything. Search an artist and try to play a song and all it does is prompt me to pay $9.99 a month. Click on one of the offered stations. And I get promptes to pay $9.99 a month. The phone is an S7. So I deleted it and went back to the competition. Also considering if this Amazon Prime is even worth it when it does not live up to all it claims to be. I would give a zero star rating if possible,amazon
5/3/2017,Enjoy!,amazon
11/1/2016,"The Amazon MP3 app came as 'bloat-ware' on my Moto Defy so I've been ignoring it for months.

11/23/2014,I enjoy Amazon music... The station choices are excellent and I like having free music available to add to my listening library.,amazon
12/31/2016,I think its nice. It downloads quickly for u. U can pick singles or the albums. U can even go by the artist if u want. Its a pretty cool little app.,amazon
9/27/2016,"Another Excellent benefit of being a Prime member. No commercials, outstanding choices available, just wish I could get the app for my Visio smart TV.",amazon
9/10/2016,"Easy to use, excellent quality. This is one heck of a product! I have recommended it to ALL of my family and friends and have absolutely NO HESITATION recommending to anyone",amazon
5/31/2016,After i purchased songs they wouldn't play kept skipping or wouldnt play without internet service. I wasted money,amazon
9/10/2017,"Amazon music is better then other app out there. The fact that no commercials or interruptions on stations is great. Lots of options when choosing playlist, and music of choice.",amazon
5/25/2016,I couldn't try because you dont accept saudi credit card,amazon
5/29/2017,Works well on Pixel,amazon
8/28/2017,Great music veriety,amazon
9/17/2017,I listen to my Amazon music more than iTunes.,amazon
6/7/2016,"So many albums and playlists to choose from in all genres, and all for free as a member! I use both video and music-a really good deal for less than $10 a month now, in my first year.",amazon
4/28/2016,I like it a lot compared to other apps. Wish I could add whole albums to playlist.,amazon
6/25/2017,"Clearly presented, a large variety, and easy access to historical music and legendary artist??????",amazon
4/28/2017,"I would like to hear more obscure songs instead of the most popular ones. Otherwise, pretty good.",amazon
7/18/2017,"I really like this, better than Pandora because you can choose music. I dont use spotify, but it seems like a similar service and it was free with my amazon prime!",amazon
7/11/2016,I would give 5 stars but you don't provide enough smooth jazz artists.,amazon
7/19/2017,why it so hard to get music,amazon
8/4/2016,"I'm just starting to use this app, so far so good, but not convinced it's better than Pandora",amazon
12/26/2015,"Free music, sometime selection is limited",amazon
6/19/2016,"All the features available exceeded my expectations -- from lyrics, to instant downloads (after a purchase of physical copies of music) to the display and layout of the music library.",amazon
4/26/2016,Not enough access to oldies for us older guys.,amazon
6/2/2016,"Commercial free Radio. Skip any number of times. Many different genres to choose from. Amazon Music is better than Pandora, better than Spotify, and better than Sound Cloud.",amazon
5/25/2016,"Tons of songs, albums and artists. Easy to navigate.....hardly uses any data on my mobile. Commercial free and I can skip songs as many times as I want. This app was worth paying for prime by itself, not to mention the other perks!",amazon
10/7/2015,"Pros: plays DRM-free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store.
 Cons: long, frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large (18K song) music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service won't allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and doesn't handle changes to playlists well.",amazon
11/12/2011,"Sluggish and halting. It does not allow for personalized sorting of music. Well, that is not exactly true, you can organize your music which the application will completely forget the next time you start it. The app is the only way to enjoy the free prime content, so it pretty much sucks.",amazon
1/23/2015,"Overall this app is competitive with Spotify and Play Music, and definitely blows Napster (Formerly Rhapsody) out of the proverbial water. It does have its pitfalls however. The biggest of which is the fact that MP3s you've already downloaded will be miscategorized. Also I've found that although the option does exist to download play lists the songs will not show up in the ""Downloaded"" section. Secondly, the music you purchase is not transferable across other platforms. Simply put, of I purchase a song outright I feel it is my right to download said song in a universal format such as .MP3. User interface is easy to navigate, and I have yet to come across an artist that is not in the ""Unlimited"" category. Anyway, I gave it a try for 1 week and have decided to switch back to Spotify premium. In my opinion the extra $2 per month is worth it.",amazon
12/23/2016,I like the amount of genres selection.,amazon
6/27/2016,"how crazy is that?
 I bet Kindle Fire owners version 1 will never get new version.
 
 A pioneer with arrows in his back!!!!
 I have 3 version 1 kindles. Loyal customer???",amazon
6/15/2014,"I bought a Zune MP3 player years ago, and I hate how they demand that you pay $150 a year for the service. I didn't remember to get online and order new songs every month, and wasted my money.
 I am SO happy with this app. Now I can listen to my favorite music anytime, and I don't have to pay a ridiculous amount (or anything at all) to use this service.",amazon
4/19/2014,easily accessible to music with extensive categories making obtaining desired music and purchasing completely stress free. Loves me some amazon prime music,amazon

6/13/2016,We enjoy being able to listen to our downloaded/purchased songs via Bluetooth in the car! Lets me choose what songs my kids can listen to.,amazon
7/21/2015,"My last CD order was damaged (CD case only). Amazon is currently refunding $12.96 but I decided to keep CD because I like it and found another case for it. Please keep the $12.96! I could not find a way to ""cancel"" my ""cancel"". Thank you!",amazon
6/18/2015,"Not easy to search.
 Limited selection",amazon
8/7/2017,"Found all the old CD's I purchased from Amazon over the last 15 years and loaded all.
 Excellent as I forgot about some of them.
 Amazon did not, even though Amazon Music player did not exist in the way back.",amazon
12/2/2015,"The only complaint I have is at times it lags & the buffering wheel just inherently spins... waiting for that hamster to croak. The other complaints have nothing to do with the app or Amazon. There are a lot of obscure groups that I listen to, most of which are not in the library. some of the groups I like aren't allowing their material to be offered to stream. Therefore, THEY, groups like Metallica, can pucker up and... well, let's keep this age appropriate & kid friendly.
 Be prepared for music streaming to suck up some data. I use this while at work with my Bluetooth & it keeps the OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD voices in the office masked. I use it while mowing the lawn with my Beats which makes that 1 1/2 hour go by REALLY fast. This app is well worth the time to install and the music you can find from your favorite artists is worth searching for. Once you build your streaming library, it's an awesome tool to have for those ""I NEED SOME METAL TO SHUT THIS @$$&%$ UP"" moments.",amazon
6/22/2016,"Not quite as good as I expected. I expected more, if not all ""free"" music. I would think my $99 per year would allow me to also download free music. There are many music players out there with free streaming, and some (Tunee) with free downloads.",amazon
6/20/2014,"With prime I can download every song I want to listen to, no ads, not a limited number of skips every hour. Everything from old school to modern music. Wish this would have come out earlier. Iheartradio and definitely Pandora you're slacking.",amazon
8/15/2015,I enjoy listening to my music when near WIFI,amazon
6/3/2016,Amazon only work with music you have previously downloaded or installed in your phone..I was lookaying for a particular artist and when I searched him amazon kept coming up but the songs I was lookaying for was not on amazon at all..,amazon
10/8/2015,"So far I like it, the lyrics are a bit off but that's no big deal I know most of the lyrics to the songs I like the repeat feature because sometimes I get interrupted and only catch part of the song.",amazon
2/9/2016,"Easy to use but requires some improvements:
 - Exit option. Application still running all the time.
 - Usage of SD card storage. Currently the application use device storage to keep offline music. A few albums will full device space. Offline files are DRM protected. They could be stored in SD without any problem.
 - Clear SD space. After removing offline music the application does not remove files from storage.
 - Optimize memory consumption. I own a Samsung S4. This application use more memory than similar applications, reaching almost 100% memory usage.
 
 I hope Amazon implement these improvements soon.",amazon

8/28/2017,We Listen to the Music all the time!,amazon
6/25/2016,Make this app movable to sd card storage! Make songs downloadable to sd card storage! Will be deleting until I see this app fixed. No more mp3 shopping from amazon until then.,amazon
3/18/2015,"I'm sure it would work wonderfully if I had unlimited data or maybe if I was using an amazon device. But for my galaxy, I find that it consumes too much memory and streams away my data. I uninstalled for this reason.",amazon
5/1/2015,"A great way to music to a broader audience. I've discovered lots of new entertainers through the ""Recommendations"".",amazon
2/1/2017,Amazon prime music app still needs to be polished up. It is not very intuitive. It does not always do what I was expecting. Also I would like to make a station a favorite but wasn't clear if that can be done. Once again not a well thought out app.,amazon
7/18/2015,Keeps telling me &#34;currently unavailable&#34; when I try to download this. I am a prime member and have been a loyal Amazon user for a very long time. Please fix this issue so I can have my music!!!,amazon
12/23/2015,"this app needs work, especially if you use the Echo app with it, they get confused and sometimes the Amazon Music app will fail to work. The only fix I've found is to reboot the phone, simply killing the app and restarting doesn't work. This is on a Moto X running Android.",amazon
3/26/2015,good service just not enough in prime,amazon
6/20/2016,Never got to use it yet fully!!!,amazon
7/7/2016,This app has really changed the way I listen to music. So many choices and so little time! For the first few days I spent more time lookaying through all the music that was available than I did listening to the music. Definitely one of the things that makes Amazon Prime a good deal.,amazon
4/7/2015,not available in my country,amazon
7/30/2017,Great selection and easy to use. I have been wanting something like this to listen to music for a while now. This fits the bill perfectly. There are no ads to deal with like other apps I have tried.,amazon
1/23/2016,Better than iTunes. I had iTunes and they were limited and you had to buy a lot of albums or songs.. MUSIC has a good variety,amazon
12/4/2016,Copy the user interface and functionality of Slacker and I'll be happier.,amazon
2/17/2016,I purchased PRIME for the music and video. When these were separated I lost interest. I have a used Alexa for sale now!,amazon

4/2/2016,Great Prime feature for hours of music.,amazon
9/4/2017,Prime Music is the best thing I am getting other than free shipping with my Prime memberships. The playlists are way better than Iheart or Panndora on top of that all the awesome free albums from so many categories including even Christian music and Latino. It has become my only music app.,amazon
12/24/2014,This is awesome. NO MORE PANDORA COMMERCIALS!!!!! I am so happy to be an amazon prime member - great benefits and this is one of them.,amazon
7/22/2015,"I am using a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 tablet and a Samsung Galaxy S4 and the volume on both keeps decreasing to zero. Both devices? I think a bug fix is in order. As a reminder, this is not a free service.",amazon
1/2/2016,"this app SUCKS!!!!! You can;t upload anything- it just circles and circles and circles. You can't figure out how to download a new version, it just takes you to this stupid page where you can add it to your cart!! Just put a damn manual upload button on the page for God's sake!!! whoever designed this app should be fired immediately!!!!! For all the money they have, they surely have crappy software engineers!",amazon
5/21/2017,Really like this so far. Not quite as intuitive as pandora but no commercials and ability to skip multiple songs makes this worth it.,amazon
7/25/2015,I have just gotten started with my Prime membership and I am simply stunned at all the available offers that come with this subscription. I am so thankful that to be a Prime member and can't wait to fully utilize my membership.,amazon
9/28/2015,This app crashes every time I try to play music from Amazon Prime.,amazon
7/31/2014,Way too much time buffering if your trying to stream. Also takes forever to build a playlist off of a desktop or laptop computer. Three times faster to do the same actions from a smart phone.,amazon

8/5/2015,I downloaded app and it doesnt show up on my phone. Where is my music. Its a new phone but should come up.,amazon
9/7/2017,Has better music and more stations,amazon
6/22/2016,"This might be free to download, but I have to say it probably costs me more money to keep it just for the simple fact that it's too easy to buy songs with it. Over all its great because I can access my purchased songs, there are no adds, and finding songs are just as easy. Maybe one day they can add it a song finder where the app listens, and finds the song?",amazon
2/1/2014,Excellent selection of music.,amazon
1/3/2017,"Alot of music, free to prime members.",amazon
6/11/2016,"Would have been better if the Prime membership has all of the benefits for all in the same house holdi think they give it to 3 household members which is fine, but the free music is only for the member.",amazon
1/7/2016,The site is a little difficult to use. Could be a little More user friendly.,amazon
4/28/2017,Prime music does not play on my Samsung Galaxy tab 4! I simply can not understand why? I tried almost everything but still it wont play. I downloaded Android version but no avail. My iMac and Mac bookay pro retina play beautifully but not on Samsung tab 4. I gave up.,amazon
4/13/2015,Listening Now. It was fast to download and has a ton of music to choose from. So glad I downloaded today.,amazon
9/27/2017,Great selection of music that can be saved to the cloud or a device. Very good,amazon
1/19/2016,Since the most recent update this app has become unusable and useless. As soon as you open the app it freezes and causes a forced close. It is so bad that it makes Google's MP3 music player lookay like geniuses created it. Please fix this payer or make the previous version available until you fix this horrible app.,amazon
9/1/2014,Uses to use Pandora but now on all my rides (Motorcycle) I listen to Prime Music. It plays all the tracks I've asked it too and adds some really good tracks that compliment my list as opposed to other apps that just toss them in.,amazon
9/14/2015,Being a member has great advantages,amazon
6/14/2016,This doesn't work at all.,amazon
7/17/2016,"Amazon cloud where all your music is stored with unlimited space was supposed to be free with my Kindle Fire. plus I'm already paying $70 a year for Amazon Prime! The Google Music Manager still has unlimited space for free (or when you purchase music from them). that's where I will be headed when Amazon says my time is up, rather than getting nickled and dimed to death and having to choose and upload those 25 songs. Bah bye, Amazon. my next tablet won't be a Kindle.",amazon
8/2/2012,Better than Spotify of course no ads.,amazon
6/7/2016,Enjoying it as an extra form of entertainment while driving in my car or home.,amazon

6/13/2016,Thousands of songs to download on your cloud and play anywhere. Multiple genres and all the functions of iTunes. Make your own playlists.so easy and best of all is free with your Prime membership. Makes the $90 a year a little easier to accept.,amazon
7/9/2015,"It still let's me queue up music to download, and indicates that it is doing so, but attempting to play things that have been &#34;downloaded&#34; just causes the app to crash.

3/23/2016,A great extra to being a prime member!,amazon
6/2/2016,"This service is... not good.
 
 At the current rate, it will never compete with pandora, spotify, iheart, or any other music service. Not much of the music I want to hear, without buying it specifically through amazon. I'll pass.",amazon

7/15/2016,So easy and I create all my different play list.,amazon
9/28/2017,I was really excited about getting more music through Amazon because i have prime. But all I'm getting is a bunch of disappointment. This useless app sends me a crash notice about every 2 hours and constantly froze when i did try and use it. Lookays like ill keep using apple.,amazon
2/24/2015,Pretty good. Wish there was more music available for free with prime though.,amazon
6/6/2017,"This is one of the best amazon apps out there. You have the option of storing music in the cloud or on your phone. And now with prime, you can get many free albums or songs for free. Such an amazing addition to an amazing online shopping website. Music doesn't skip or buffer when stored in the cloud. Sound quality is amazing.",amazon
6/25/2014,"Not nearly enough songs available as Rhapsody and you can only download to your computer if you purchase them, also unlike Rhapsody. Many songs you purchase do not include an accurate description. I won't be renewing my subscription at the end of my year. I will be going back to Rhapsody.",amazon

12/7/2016,"If you have 8 gb total on the internal storage and 32 gb of external storage (sd), you want to put large files, like music, on the external card. When I ran out of internal storage I checked the apps using the most storage: Amazon music, Amazon Kindle and the Amazon app were the top 3 and none have the option to move storage to the external sd, that I found. I uninstalled all three and all is good. It's a shame, but Amazon sure seems out of touch with what customers want and need for large file storage.",amazon
12/16/2014,Lots of free options with a tremendous variety.,amazon

12/9/2016,"I am actually disappointed with Amazon Prime Music, which is odd because everything else Amazon has touched is basically gold. The app crashes and the buffering time is awful. I am waiting for some sort of update or fix.",amazon
10/9/2015,"Not only is the app itself difficult to navigate and completely the opposite of intuitive, now it has started crashing as soon as it opens. I switched from Slacker and started paying for a Prime membership to avoid the lags and crashing issues with Slacker, so I'm extremely irritated with this.",amazon

 Tank you, Yamil.
 Have a nice night.",amazon
8/10/2015,"Is nice that i can download any MP3 purchase directly to my Android Tablet, instead of having to hookayup the USB cable and transfer it that way.

Nice App.",amazon
3/25/2014,Well i defently liked the service in the beginning but when i got a new phone i can not figure out how to load my 500 or so songs that i paid for onto my new phone.

12/28/2016,Prime would be great if the encrypted files would download to the card instead. My phone stays constantly full and I have to delete music to add any more. I already buy so much music that I wanted prime so I could check out what I haven't heard but what a hassle,amazon
4/10/2015,"great streaming option for desktops. I have not tried the mobile phone streaming app yet, but if it works as slickly as the desktop streaming this will be a nice option.
 
 Only thing I don't like is there is a pause between songs. Might be nice if it matched up so one song blended into the next for sound continuity.",amazon
6/22/2014,Sorry you ran me away from purchasing music. It is interesting that this dept really wants the site to fail. Your customers should not have to go through crap to spend their hard earned money with you or enjoy a service that you offered. It was not brokayen WHY DID YOU TRY TO FIX IT!!!!,amazon

3/29/2015,What's not to like? Free music streaming. You can't beat it with a stick.,amazon
8/3/2017,"This app used to work great about 3 updates back, but now it is terrible! Shuffle just plays the same set of songs over and over despite adding new music to the library. If you skip a song, the app thinks you are still on the old song and plays the previous track from cache as the track you just skipped to. The interface is so so. I'm lookaying for a different app to play my music from. This one just sucks.",amazon

 And as others have written, you can't download any of this music onto an SD card to put into your tablet or phone. I don't know about you, but I prefer to store photos & music on an SD card so as to not fill up the device's memory unnecessarily. Personally, I don't like to tote a laptop around just to listen to music, and I have an awesome stereo in the house, so unless I can use this on my tablet, why bother????
 So this is now a 100% useless service I am paying for. Besides raising the annual fee $20 a year, it's just another reason to not renew my Amazon Prime membership.",amazon
6/17/2014,Finally was able to get my husband up and running with something simple to play music from his phone. Works great and he is feeling quite smart and a bit more caught up with the times. There is music for any kind of taste or mood you might find yourself in!,amazon

4/16/2017,"Got Prime? Gotta have this. It's great not having to rely on a browser, and all the resources they can eat up. It's pretty lightweight, cross-platform (Windows and Android - GET ON LINUX!), and is a pretty solid, if basic, player even without Amazon music.",amazon
4/28/2015,"This used to be my main MP3 player on Android. It was never great, but it worked. Most recent updates have made it annoying to use as just a player.

 Amazon now lets me for free, in my mind because of the overall value of my Prime membership.",amazon
8/17/2015,Limited inventory and dated UX.,amazon
6/9/2016,It sux. Does not work!,amazon
7/8/2016,"My phone is Android Chinese, does not work, I change it for another - a cell phone or do not work, I used to buy at Amazon mp3 does not work, do not feel happy, I hope to correct as soon as possible",amazon
10/28/2014,What an AWESOME collection of music for Amazon Prime Members to enjoy for free.,amazon
7/18/2015,It is the best music app! You can listen to your music offline. I think that is the best part! You can get the music you like for free! You put the app on several devices too!,amazon
3/29/2016,"This app makes getting my music so easy! AND!!! You cannot beat Prime music for their selections. Love,love,love!",amazon
7/6/2015,"First the selection of artist and music is very limited unless you like Billy Joel or some of the other artist who show up everywhere.Second when i try to down load to my kindle fire it says it's not compatible.
  So for me 1 star",amazon
6/16/2014,"I always find with Chvrches that it take a few listens to really get into each song, but once I do and all the smaller details start to become apparent, well... they arent my favorite band for nothing! Awesome album!",amazon
10/7/2015,Good musiv variety although they make it very difficult to put app on Android and am not able to get it working at all on Kindle which is very surprising as uts an amazon product.,amazon
3/10/2016,Best app to use for music when you have the subscription,amazon
6/9/2017,The sound quality is lit fam,amazon
6/16/2016,"A bargain no matter what your download preferences are. Sure, there are artists that I would like to see on the free side, but at the price of Prime membership.....Enough said.",amazon
3/22/2016,"Dial up the music you like. Not all music is available, but there is enough to make you happy. No commercials.",amazon
1/25/2017,"I don't understand why I can get Prime stations on my HTC One A9 phone, but not on my Kindle Fire HD, which is manufactured by Amazon. Fix this, and this app will get 5 stars.",amazon
3/22/2016,Haven't got to explore much yet but like the lyrics option on most songs. I like that I could download it on my windows computer as well so I could connect to my TV.,amazon
5/10/2016,Worth the price of Prime alone.,amazon
6/5/2016,"This App rocks! I have it on my S5, my 2 in 1 Dell Laptop, my Kindle Fire, my work computer, I have never had a problem with this App (knock on wood) Awesome Job Amazon!!!! <3",amazon
3/8/2016,Great variety with no ads!,amazon
6/21/2016,"I was hoping Prime music was going to be the answer to what service I should use since I was already paying for Prime, but it won't work with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 android tablet. Very disappointed. Will probably have to go with Spotify.",amazon
6/10/2015,User friendly and intuitive.,amazon
6/14/2016,"No problems with downloading any music. Creating ""playlist"" is a breeze. Downloaded the ""Amazon Music"" app for my Galaxy S5 and can play my music any where at any time. I use Media Monkey on my PC but this is my go-to app when I'm away from my desktop.",amazon
2/20/2015,Selection of free songs is very limited. Couldn't find any of my music. I'd have to buy them. I'll be sticking with Google Play for all my music.,amazon
7/31/2016,So much better than iTunes!!!,amazon
6/10/2016,If this app came on your phone only your carrier can decide if you can remove it or not. Sprint did not preload this app on my phone. I chose to download and use it. I found I could move the app to the SD card on my phone. It works just fine there. I play music stored on my SD card far more than the stuff on my cloud drive. I like this app. I don't like reviews that rate apps down for issues caused by choices made by carriers.,amazon
1/6/2013,Wouldn't download. It just kept saying install pending.,amazon
11/10/2017,"This is the best. Since I have Amazon Prime, I get thousands of song free! I wish I had been using this sooner.",amazon
2/10/2017,"Better than Pandora (I'm with Pandora since they started) because you can listen to any song you want, fast forward, go back while the song is playing, repeat a song that you like (as many times as you want) and you can even make your own playlists.",amazon
5/12/2015,I like that I can preview a song before purchasing it. I wish that the app would not be deleted every time samsung does an up grade.,amazon
9/17/2016,All I can do is see that I have purchased the app and cannot download to my android device! No directions are given and it is not an automatic download! What a crappy app!,amazon
4/10/2016,"It's okay as an app - it does what it sets out to do, and I appreciate having some rather large albums in the cloud, rather than taking up space on my device, but: the app only opens in portrait mode, and I usually use my tablet in landscape mode. It's great to be able to listen to music while working, but it's super annoying when typing, editing spreadsheets, or doing other work (or even playing games!) to have everything in landscape EXCEPT for Amazon Music - I either have to turn my head sideways (not really comfortable) or turn the whole tablet/case/keyboard sideways (really inconvenient!).",amazon
6/17/2014,"it would not download my music without paying for what I have purchased in the past with the regular cloud player
 I was not lookaying to upgrade since I just received a new phone. all I would like to do is download the music I have already purchased.",amazon
5/15/2015,"Lousy app. Buggy, freezes, and now has deleted my playlists on my device. I still have the songs, but have to rebuild playlists. Can we even import playlists from Cloud to device? Last I tried that was a no-go. I'm a major Amazon fan, have Prime, and buy most everything through Amazon. This app is lousy.",amazon
7/31/2014,Anything you can find it here,amazon
6/4/2016,I use this app constantly on my computer it is so much nicer than having to spend the computer memory space on iTunes!,amazon
5/22/2013,"I'm having a very difficult, most times impossible, time downloading the songs, so I can listen when out of range of wifi. I have not contacted Amazon.com yet so I still may be able to fix this problem. If I get it fixed I will give it a 5 star rating.",amazon
4/17/2015,"I wasn't sure I wanted to watch it, but got hookayed after the 1st episode and finished both seasons. Lookaying forward to season 3.",amazon
10/5/2016,"Great Music selections, huge variety, and easy to use!",amazon
9/14/2017,Amazon music doesn't have a large variety of music. The app freezes a lot and the Jazz selection is very thin.,amazon
1/24/2017,Short on new music. Used to be able to download to my PC now it won't and I have to listen through my browser.,amazon
1/23/2017,I like it so far. Have not had a chance to figure it out yet. I do like that I finally have music on my phone.,amazon
9/7/2017,Still crashes constantly. I really enjoy the playlist I've gathered in the app... but that does me no good if the app is unable to run correctly.,amazon
7/25/2016,As far as current and top hits are concerned you have access to EVERYONE. The app itself is smooth doesn't lag and play music seamlessly.,amazon
10/3/2016,"Complicated, confusing, advertises downloads when they do not download, impossible to find a human being to assist you, a waste of money.",amazon
8/27/2016,"does not work in Latin America, other platforms like spotify works well in Colombia, please include amazon music as soon as possible, I probably cancel my prime subscription because amazon music and video does not work in my country",amazon
7/21/2015,Has a lot of music I want,amazon
6/19/2016,The quantity of music available in the genre(s) of music i like (punk/heavy metal/hardcore/speed metal) is awesome. Far exceeds their competition!,amazon
7/19/2016,Just started using this but so far great,amazon
10/15/2017,Just another extra from prime. Couldn't be happier with my purchase,amazon
4/29/2017,Lots music to choose from.,amazon
6/14/2016,"Free service that comes with Prime. A great addition, although I don't use it as much as I use other music streaming apps/services.",amazon
9/18/2016,"I really like amazon's prime music. If I could add one thing, it would be the option to have prime create stations based on an artist. I could enter an artist name and prime could custom create a station of similar music.",amazon
9/2/2015,Best value going if you are currently a prime member.,amazon
7/24/2017,works as specified ...,amazon
1/29/2015,Great selection of music! Free Prime Music give the opportunity to download some albums and artists before your make a major investment.,amazon
8/26/2016,Excellent music selection,amazon
6/15/2016,Gives me a nice selection of music and comedy. I use a Bluetooth speaker and I have tunes wherever I'm working around the house,amazon
10/3/2016,"Great selection, great prices, great listening app plus the flexibility of MP3 format.",amazon
4/7/2015,There's nothing like it!,amazon
6/17/2016,"I say its okay because the app does stream music but,
 very slow down load
 I cant find all the songs that I want
 and there's no adequate playlist program
 In other words you need to be as good as or better than Spotify",amazon
7/6/2015,"I'm learning how to use the features, might give it a better rating after I try it for a while",amazon
8/2/2017,It has a pretty decent collection of music and the variety is great. I particularity like the stations that allow you to explore music you are interested in with unlimited skips and ad free. It has definitely become an everyday app,amazon
7/18/2015,This is a must have. You can have it on your phone or your PC and this works very well. I cannot live without this.,amazon
11/13/2016,GREAT GREAT GREAT !!!!!,amazon
6/20/2016,This was the first player I didn't have issues with losing a signal and they have music options for everyone,amazon
1/5/2017,Searching music is not that easy for Latin music. It would be nice if you searched one band that it tells you lookay at these others that are the same type of music.,amazon
5/1/2016,"Prime Music is great! I have loads of albums in my library, and I just started using the stations streaming music from my phone through my car stereo. It's commercial free and the music choices are endless. Thank you!",amazon
9/13/2015,the cloud player is a great feature on the app. i like that feature a lot and the music plays nice,amazon
7/6/2013,No need of a review. Last one posted said I didn't follow the guidelines with a charger for a camera. Here you think I'll see if this makes it...,amazon
4/26/2015,This process was very simple and easy to use to get my songs at a good price. Credit amazon with a great music store.,amazon
8/4/2015,"It's a little confusing on picking and downloading the music.
 Also, I don't know how to turn it off other than to restart my phone. Help!",amazon
7/18/2016,"The Amazon mp3 player is very good I like the ability to be able to access my music anywhere.
 The player plays nice even tone music. It sounds great. As a bonus any music that you purchase from amazon DOESN'T GO AGAINST YOUR STORAGE. This provides a nice incentive to purchase music from Amazon. All in all if you like music and like to buy music this the player to get. For a low cost you can incrase your storage",amazon
1/8/2013,"This app is great. I can listen to music without having to pay for it, and the channels are great as well. Also, if I skip songs, there isn't a limit like there are on some other apps.",amazon
1/18/2016,Good amount of music.selection is good. Hope they add more song. Not a fan of the navigation. It's not easy to navigate.,amazon
10/20/2016,Huge variety of music,amazon
6/22/2016,180 days to activate a transfer total bull I logout to use a different account to order a few songs then changed back to mine now I got to wait so I can listen to it you really suck,amazon
2/7/2016,"This app changed my data settings. Normally my phone is set to download over WiFi only. After this app installed , I checked my download settings and it changed to download via data.
 Not a very nice surprise.",amazon
8/2/2014,Selection is fantastic.,amazon
6/14/2016,Will not upload my autorip purchase,amazon
5/5/2016,"Downloaded app x1, bought wonderful music (Portguese Fado Guitar), deleted app again because I suspected ample data usage. Downloaded app again because I wanted to hear the music I paid for, but I deleted the app again: it devours my data! Feel cheated, but that's how it goes.",amazon
12/8/2014,"Amazon Music is awesome and easy to use.
 I encourage anyone that reads this to get Prime....you will not regret this awesome feature.
 
 Herman",amazon
5/23/2016,Best music option for phones and tablets. Upload your own music and playlists or select music and playlists and stations from thousands of artists. Just another great perk to being a Prime member.,amazon
12/3/2015,"It works but the sound quality coming from a phone isn't that great. I guess I would use music on my phone in the car if driving through an area where radio reception isn't so good. Seems easier to just turn on the car radio or play a CD. I know people listen to music on their phones wearing headphones while jogging, commuting etc.",amazon
3/28/2014,"Only listened to a couple of albums and I have to say ""I'm impressed that it is packaged with Amazon prime."" I don't have to wait for the songs I want to hear. This is very important to me.",amazon
11/20/2015,"The Mac version of Amazon Music Player is garbage, pure and simple. I can't speak for the Windows version, but the Mac version frequently (read: almost always) hangs for LONG periods of time before showing tracks in any section of the player. It also appears to use a lot of resources - I see system-wide issues while using Music Player, but when I completely close out of it, OS X goes back to behaving like it should. Now that we're forced to use this player to download any music we've added to Amazon Music, I've gone from merely irritated to absolutely angry. It is AWFUL software, and after several years dealing with quirks and outright problems with Amazon Music, I really wonder if Amazon will EVER get this working correctly.
 
 Other ""fun"" issues:
 
 Badly matched songs (completely the wrong recordings - we're talking live songs being replaced by studio versions!) You can attempt to correct the match, but I have yet to get this to work well.
 
 MISSING songs! Inexplicably, some songs are just GONE from my library. Totally random - most albums are fine, others are missing this or that song, or maybe a couple. Infuriating.
 
 Tag editor destroys existing ID3 tags: if you dare edit any info in the file(s) you've uploaded, you will be rewarded with a downloadable version that has completely stripped out ALL tags. You won't know what song is what. ALL tags are empty, so there will be no artist to go by, no track name, no track number, no album name. NOTHING. This sounds completely unacceptable were it not for the need to rarely do this, but what makes it truly completely unacceptable is the fact that tracks in your library may randomly have their ID3 tags altered by either the uploader, whatever software runs on Amazon's servers, or the Music Player. And you're screwed at that point.
 
 Other than that, it's GREAT.",amazon
10/19/2014,Best album by them yet,amazon
6/16/2016,"Havent fully explored everything it has to offer but, so far i am very happy to have purchased Prime on Amazon. Plus there is so much more with the Prime membership it's well worth tha cost.. Very happy customer !!!",amazon
9/13/2015,Can't play prime music on my fire tablet !,amazon
4/10/2016,I liked the idea of this app....but something feels kinda unstable about it. It always crashes and suddenly closes when I try to use it on my Samsung Android phone. It is quite annoying to be listening to music and it suddenly stops mid song.,amazon
5/18/2015,Meets my satisfaction,amazon
6/19/2016,So nice to pick the movies you love!,amazon
10/29/2015,"Great app, but way too limited in its music collection when you compare it to Google Play. I hope the library grows.",amazon
8/1/2015,"Great app. The UI is excellently designed and well thought out. Store, Library and Player navigation in excellent. I would give it a perfect 5/5 stars but for one fundamental flaw. Why the heck should I have to submit my credit card details when I'm already logged into my Amazon account. All my payment details are already saved on my account, aren't they?",amazon
12/1/2013,"The old Amazon MP3 always worked - and was usually my de facto music player on my phone. It was replaced with this slow, unweildy monstrosity that almost always crashes.",amazon
1/14/2015,All sorts of problems getting this to work.,amazon
4/6/2016,"Make an option to exit the app. Put more selection into the Prime eligible music, there has to be a better way to search for music without having NOW and KIDZBOP being every other item on the list. Add more filters to make searching for music easier.",amazon
4/9/2015,"Workd great. If I lookay my kindle battery or don't want to carry it along with the other 325 pounds of stuff in my purse. Have a back-up, plus can play what I want to listen to while I'm driving. Thank you!",amazon
10/12/2015,This is great. Much better than google play's music feature and the android app is quite good as well. This was actually one of the things that made me want to get Amazon prime.,amazon
2/15/2016,"Wonderful to access my music on my laptop, tablet and Fire, and when I purchase and download tracks and songs, they are automatically transmitted into my music library on all three.",amazon
1/28/2016,I find just about everything I am lookaying for and then some. Great business.,amazon
10/17/2017,I was under the impression I could download about any song I could think of but I've come across a few that I would have to pay to download. I thought the annual fee covered that,amazon
2/9/2016,this is a great way to listen to music you like without having to purchase it separately. But easily you can purchase albums or singles from it.,amazon
6/30/2016,LUV IT!! AWSOME WITH PRIME. STokayED TO GET TO LISTEN TO WHOLE ALBUMS WITHOUT COMMERCIALS!!!,amazon
5/4/2017,such a great app,amazon
9/26/2015,works great would like to figure out how to store music offline,amazon
12/12/2014,"It's functionality is nice. I like that I can choose ""Offline Music"" and just listen to my own songs rather than streaming randomly from some online stream. However, in my experience thus far, the sound processing and regeneration through my bluetooth connection (to my car stereo) is lacking. The full range of the music doesn't seem to be getting through -- almost as if it thinks I'm playing to headphones and so it's cutting back on the bass a bit. I've found some (not many!) music players that will allow me to pause the music from my stereo. Maybe its my stereo's fault, but I can't do that with the Amazon Music App. It also doesn't show the time tracking of the track that's playing, where some players seem to be able to do that just fine. It would also be nice if they'd get on board with the ""Google Assistant"" programming and make it so I can tell ""okay Google"" to run certain commands within the app.",amazon
5/31/2017,Great selection of recommended music. It's like Amazon Music gets me!,amazon
2/8/2016,"It's got a good amount of popular songs, and bands on here. It not near Spotify variety, but for casual listening if you alredy have Prime it's definitely an app worth getting.",amazon
2/16/2016,"Good selection of music with great quality, all included with my Prime subscription, what's not to like?",amazon
2/2/2017,"Music selections are always changing, so your selections may not be there when you go back later to listen!",amazon
12/7/2016,Very good music site,amazon
6/16/2016,"Great application, but I wish there was a way to integrate the music on my phone's physical memory with the songs I have in my Prime library.",amazon
7/15/2016,"This is almost perfect, just add a way to search prime music by genre, and a way to share a suggested album or song with prime friends and family. Then you'll have a 5 star",amazon
3/2/2016,Easy to install and use. Bit limited on range and choice compared to Spotify and Deezer but good value overall,amazon
11/23/2016,Awesome as always,amazon
6/25/2016,Awesome stations,amazon
6/28/2016,"Amazon music is wonderful. There is a great selection and it is very easy to use, download and transfer.",amazon
12/17/2016,Good stuff here!,amazon

9/21/2017,for prime customers this is an awesome venue.,amazon
8/15/2014,JUST START LISTENING TO IT TODAY AND HAVING THE BEST TIME LISTENING TO OLD AND NEW MUSIC.,amazon
6/10/2017,"There is a great selection of music and also Prime music. Big problem with skips during playback of downloads. If the skips were not there, the player would be comparable with my Wife's iphone.",amazon
12/3/2015,GREAT APP W/NO ADS,amazon
6/20/2016,"Work good, great tunes, the only problem I have is I can't stop it playing without powering down my unit.",amazon
12/12/2016,Small library of music,amazon
6/7/2016,Good selection of music. Rivals Pandora and other streaming services because NO ADS. You're already paying for Prime- take advantage of this!,amazon
7/12/2016,"The app is easy to use, both for Android and PC. My only gripe -- and it's less about the app than the songs that can't be saved to the cloud -- is that when I purchase a CD on Amazon, only some of the songs transfer to the cloud. In some cases, very few of the songs. I'm guessing this is a copyright issue, but it is disappointing nonetheless. If not for that, I'd give the app 5 stars.",amazon
6/16/2013,"Awesome, to have this much music @ your fingertip or with your voice. Customerservice is the very best.",amazon
1/14/2017,"The only complaint I would have is that there could be more songs, but that is strictly my being cheap.",amazon
1/30/2017,"Limited bollywood songs. But the quality of songs is good. On comparing with other competitors, we need options like mirroring to other device through airplay or casting such as Logitech, chrome.",amazon
11/10/2015,I don't think amazon knows yet. Selection is weak. Queuing up a play list is clunky and not intuitive. Get back to me when you guys figure it out as I have Pandora and Spotify and don't have to pay $100/yr to get access.,amazon
6/17/2014,"Good, but skips with bluetooth on",amazon
7/8/2017,"I'm new to Amazon Prime Music App. I use it for my workouts that I've just started. I've found music from all genres and decades, for me its a hit so far so good.5stars*.",amazon
3/4/2016,"Dropped my Spotify account after realizing it cost more than Amazon Prime--which gives me way more! A few of my Spotify albums are not on Amazon yet, but I don't miss them, especially since this is free with my Prime membership.",amazon
6/28/2015,"There are a lot of artists I can't get, otherwise it's great!",amazon
7/22/2015,This app is important to me in many ways. It great when I am stress and then I go work out . It has music it current.,amazon
10/17/2016,Really annoying that the music does not stop playing when I get out of my car (Bluetooth disconnects).,amazon
1/11/2017,"App is okay, however, can't listen to a song before purchasing it. No, ""try it before you buy it"" option, so I ended up purchasing a song I didn't want. :-(",amazon
3/29/2016,"What a great way ro listen to new music using your prime account. You can make multiple playlists thar are right for any of your moods. I have discovered some great tracks and artists in the libraries. Try this one, and see if you like it as much as I do!",amazon
2/9/2015,I can't find no flaws,amazon
6/6/2016,"Good app. Nice way to listen to your favorite music, especially the music not being played on the radio now. Still learning how to navigate the app but seems easy enough.",amazon
3/3/2016,"Amazon music is the best. It is simple, and all the songs I want are there and easy to put into my playlist. And they are free as long as I don't want to download them. I recommend it to all my friends.",amazon
10/15/2015,I really like the download function. I haven't figured out how to organize the songs very well yet. The Music quality is good and album covers are beautiful.,amazon
4/21/2016,"This is an excellent music player, and does well whether it is feeding from the cloud or from your local device. It could use the ability to backup an on-device playlist to the cloud, and download a cloud playlist to the phone or tablet, resolving it to music already on the device. It's a real problem when you create a playlist of songs, and if the device goes through a major reset of some kind that clears the media database, then the playlist is lost forever and needs to be recreated.",amazon
10/13/2011,Some of the music I listen to isn't there but overall a great music service that I can listen to anywhere.,amazon
12/1/2016,"Not as much music as I had hoped,at least not what I listen to. It's okay. But I more than likely won't be keeping prime . After this year I will be cancelling.

7/10/2017,A plus,amazon
5/29/2017,"I had Amazon Prime before I really tookay advantage of all it has to offer, and now I can't live without it. They have a fantastic selection of Christian and Worship music which has been hard to find in one place!",amazon
9/7/2015,"After repeated tries on my OnePlus One, Amazon Music always crashes when trying to open. It's a good thing I have Google All Access. I also cannot see this app in the Google Play Store anymore, which indicates that they could have dropped support for this phone. Disappointed.",amazon
11/14/2014,"The upside of this app is that you can find virtually any song you suddenly have an urge to hear, and with Prime you can do it at no extra cost.
 
 The UI has gotten much better over the last year. It lookays the same but it's much more responsive.",amazon
4/10/2015,I do not like that I can not put my music on my SD card. What the heck! Also what is the deal with apps now? They think they need access to everything in your device! I don't think so! For this reason I Uninstalled the app. NO ONE BUT ME NEEDS ACCESS TO MY CALLS AND MY SD CARD!,amazon
10/31/2014,The music selection is fine and quality great... However it is difficult to turn off. The only was is to log out or clear cache. Stopping music should be more intuitive.,amazon
3/1/2016,Only down fall I couldn't get it to work with my Smart TV ....I just purchased my TV this year....can't find or download the App. Would be nice to play my own Music instead of the MILK Music all the time !!!!! :(,amazon

7/21/2017,"Very nice app, easy and convenient to access amazon music. Get in Play Store and definitely 5 stars.",amazon
12/23/2016,"Decent choice of songs but the catalog is by no means exhaustive. Still, as a free service with my prime membership I can't complain.",amazon

Sure, not every artist is available to stream, but many hours of music are available. The ability to add songs to your library, make play lists and sort by artist, song or genre make this a very usable way to enjoy music.

5/21/2016,It is great on my computer. It was great on my kindle but since the last update it won't load on my kindle. My kindle is authorized to use it. I have full bars on my WiFi yet it will not load. It will not even load my offline content. It just stay will the line thing that spins around in a circle constantly spinning but nothing in the background but a blank screen with the side possible accessible such as going to your library and things. or is just a blank screen. with no spinning line. If it was working it would be five stars.,amazon

9/13/2015,Semi-clunky interface. Realize that use of this app means being tied to your smartphone/similar. Amazon doesn't want to become a Pandora and allow streaming through certain electronic equipment. Until then I'll remain a non-user.,amazon
5/8/2015,A better app than most but only wish that it had an wake up alarm and that it had more control for my android auto.,amazon

5/17/2014,I got this app because it allows me to import my music to my android for use with a ringtone converter. (I can't upload with USB because I can't find a compatible data cable.) The bonus is that it plays my music loud enough to actually hear without headphones. The only downside is that the free app is limited to only 250 songs.,amazon
1/28/2014,I like Google play music better.,amazon
4/5/2016,"This is a very cool service, but I don't have that much time to listen to music anymore. But it's an Amazon Prime product, so you know it's gonna be great anyway.",amazon
3/2/2016,"Another great benefit of being an Amazon Prime member, usd99 annually. With this app, I can get my Prime music on my android tablet. (Edit=>) For security purposes, later versions of android were modified to prevent apps from writing easily to the add-on SD card. But each app can create ONE folder on the add-on card to write to. Amazon Music apparently hasn't chosen to do so.
 
 But that's not a problem since you can connect your android tablet/phone to your PC using a USB cord (you can use the one for charging). With your Windows PC and android device on (signed on to both), both the internal and external storage for your device will appear either as folders, or as new drives. This allows you to read, write, move all your files from one storage area to another or to/from your PC. I think you should change your device time to lock to give you enough time to accomplish your business when you are moving files around using this method. Change it back when you are done.
 
 Meanwhile, there is an app named ""Amazon MP3 Mover"" that will move any amazon mp3 music you buy to the add-on SD card, to the app's assigned folder.
 
 [On copying my music from my PC to a folder [Music] I created on my add-on card, error messages would periodically appear. Some were that there was no license for music that required a license. Some were that the format was not recognized. Just hit ""skip"".]",amazon

6/2/2017,"This is one of the best examples of why software should work flawlessly, but the team behind amazon music makes sure it doesn't.

They were stored on my device fine, but the app day restarting every 5 minutes to download these two albums. I've always installed from the play store, let's see if you put a different version on your app store. I finally got a premium PHONE, LG G3, that just might run amazon prime music, but it's just that deplorable of programming. Please revamp the app, compared to the rest of Amazon this is atrocious.",amazon
3/29/2015,Great app. The only reason I give 4 stars is because it won't transfer all of your music in your library. I cracked my screen on my phone and had to get a replacement... was disappointed when all of my music didn't transfer.,amazon

6/17/2014,"The interface is lacking, and the whole &#34;cloud or device&#34; thing is confusing. The navigation around the app shouldn't just default to albums. And it won't read any audio from an SD card, so if I put a bunch of music on a card it is invisible.",amazon

12/23/2015,"It is difficult, sometimes impossible, to manage music files from the app. This makes downloading or deleting Prime Music impossible at moments. Your Prime Music is also saved to your internal storage with no option to put it on SD card which is a huge disadvantage if you have small internal storage
 
 Good luck trying to delete MP3s through the app as it will most likely remove the song from the app but keep the files on your device only to appear again in the app later. The experience with Prime Music would improve drastically if basic file management worked smoothly.",amazon
3/1/2015,Once you tell it what you like and what you don't it's fantastic. I practically never have to skip a song.,amazon
10/23/2016,"The only thing I like about this app is it makes my music available. Given the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise. They did just recently add a scroll where I can lookay for songs by their name and actually tell what letter I am near, before it was just a guessing game. The app really works best on WiFi and is spotty otherwise. It does not give me the option to listen to music based upon the genres So I am normally listening to all my music at once and skipping a lot of songs. If I search for an artist it does not let me play all songs with them in it. Additionally if I search for a song I have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list. This is why I only use this app if I will be in the car an hour or more. It takes too much time to work it otherwise. So I still am stuck with a limited selection of music that can fit on my phone.",amazon

Wow, now maybe FB can start charging me to post messages too.",amazon
1/10/2017,"This is an added bonus with a Prime membership, and as such, it's great!
 
 The selection is a little limited compared to other music streaming services, but that's not a problem for me.
 They've added new features like radio stations and curated playlists, so I find myself using this app and the web player quite frequently.
 
 The mobile app allows to download songs and playlists for offline listening, so that's a great feature. Though the downloaded songs will not be detected by other media player apps on the device.
 
 It's not pushy in trying to make me buy more music. There are no ads.
 
 I did not find this app for my smart TV and Blu-ray player, so that was disappointing. But some media players like Rokayu support it, so you could use your home theater to listen to Amazon Music.",amazon

They had music I haven't heard in 20+ years its awesome one of the many reasons I renewed my subscription to Prime.

Listen to me take the time to check the whole "" Prime offer "" out before you decline. I wasn't going to buy into the Amazon prime thing at all but as I was against the wall and x-mas was only 2 weeks away ""Free shipping & I got a free 30 day trial membership no strings attached "" when the dust settled & it was over I had the time to use prime I loved it and I will say this use the 30 day trail free with all the benefits free shipping free movies, games plus ""Alexa "" you and your family will wonder how & why you didn't sign up sooner.

7/20/2015,I found it hard to navigate. I could not put it in a playlist on my desktop and open the list on my phone. I probably will not use it much. I have my music on my Kindle Fire.,amazon
12/3/2015,"I deleted this and it won't stop crashing my phone every so often, like a rejected ghost",amazon
2/3/2017,"i listen to focus music on this amazing app every single day! no noise, no ad, just joy!",amazon
1/26/2017,It's a great addition to your prime membership and I really like the service. I was actually surprised at the wide selection of available music.,amazon
4/20/2016,"I wasn't really big on this app until i realized that all the music i had purchased from Amazon was put on my 'cloud' and I didn't have to do a thing. It really does make purchasing music easier. I can buy the song and once it's in my cloud, I have access to it from whatever device I use - my tablet, my pc, my laptop or my smartphone. MUCH nicer than having to add the music manually to all of those devices.",amazon
2/2/2013,It lets you have so many variables of genre's .. its Awesome!,amazon
3/17/2016,Very satisfied with this service,amazon
4/28/2017,"Amazon will not fix SYNC WITH CLOUD ISSUES. I have even given them the firewall logs of my phone to show what servers, ports, times, etc the app is trying to connect to. That way it makes their jobs very simple to troubleshoot by simply lookaying at an error code on that server. They have had 16 months and can't seem to do a simple task such as that. I am a 17 year Network Engineer and do this kind of stuff day in and day out. My PRIME account is useless but yet I paid over $100 for 16 months now to stream music.....no dice. I want a refund.
 
 I have spent over $2,000 dollars on amazon mp3 music and I can't access any of it. Easily a song a day I buy.....havent bought anything in last 4-6 months due to not being able to access it.",amazon
11/18/2016,"This is such a quick and easy way to find my music! Prime members get a lot of music free, and the charge for the others is very low. I will use this for my primary music storage! If you haven't taken a lookay at this, I urge you to consider it.",amazon
4/6/2015,"Great selection! I had Google Play Music, but switched to Amazon and am happy with the choice.",amazon
11/23/2016,U met my exspectations,amazon
6/14/2016,"Doesn't seem like there is very good connectivity. Stops very quickly when signal strength is low, and does not restart automatically. Started the same station on a different day and it started with same song as before. Pandora seems to be a much more robust service. Wish it was better as I like taking advantage of Amazon Prime services and could see benefits of being connected to Amazon shopping.",amazon
4/17/2015,"With Amazon Prime membership you can download music for free. There are awesome songs on here to choose from & I listen to them all them time. The only way it could be better was if they kept adding more music....oh wait, they do! So enjoy!!",amazon
2/20/2015,"Literally thousands of free hit songs and albums from the Forties to the latest hits! You can listen or sample or buy, making playlists of your favorites as you browse to ears content.",amazon
10/26/2015,Yes it is excellent if only I could access it from my kindle. Does not work on my kindle!!!,amazon
12/2/2016,"I am subscribed to this as a benefit of Prime, it is very user friendly and all the music you want at your fingertips!",amazon
8/9/2016,This is the best music app!!!!!,amazon
3/29/2017,Doesn't come close to the selection convenience or ease of use of an of the other major music subscription services. I was hoping this would push me to resubscribe to prime. But my Netflix and Beats subscription have everything I want from prime and do it better.,amazon
10/31/2014,"Amazon MP3 was the answer to the problem of finding novelty tunes, sound effects, movie themes and science fiction music. I fondly remembered all the novelty tunes of the 1970's which were played regularly on the radio. But how to listen again? I certainly don't want entire albums in some cases. So I picked out the ones I like from Amazon MP3, and viola - back to the fun times. Thank you , Amazon MP3.",amazon
10/28/2012,"Only one complaint. When listening to my mp3s, I can't fast forward or rewind to a selected point. It's back to the beginning or nothing.",amazon
5/18/2016,"great to have but downloaded a certain album and went to listen to it, it was no longer available",amazon
7/31/2015,"There is a good selection, but still needs a broader selections by genre . There is a ton of top 40 stations, but no as many other styles, lack of folk, classical, oldies, etc. I am hoping the collections grow with age",amazon
5/30/2015,"Enjoyed listening to music from my ""younger days"".",amazon
6/16/2017,Nice way to listen to new music I might not have otherwise,amazon
10/4/2017,"Is Amazon serious?? An Amazon product incompatible with an amazon app. A laptop gets more attractive every day. VERY disappointed, Amazon.",amazon
2/20/2015,"It's good... But far from great, really enjoyed Spotify, but jumped ship with the $65 Prime membership. It'll do for now, will give a better star rating when they're catalogue expands.",amazon

2/21/2016,Good selection of classic rock,amazon
5/3/2017,"its kinda confusing when you are trying to search for music, but i like it and it work pretty good",amazon
10/28/2016,"When Amazon says if you download the app they give you 25.00 towards purchase of songs, movies, etc. When I go to use that credit, it tells me to update my payment method. It's BOUGUS!",amazon
10/22/2015,Maybe it's just me but I don't see how this app does anything but play songs that you already had on your phone and sell new songs to you. I can't find where it streams anything like Pandora or Rhapsody or iTunes. What's the big deal? Why should I use this over the apps I already have?,amazon
6/25/2014,Great music app and service both on line and off. Enjoy!,amazon
9/12/2017,I use it all the time for mostly nighttime music listening. Great selection and another good perk for Amazon Prime.,amazon

10/9/2016,"Streaming variety and selection has been great. Even better, no annoying commercials!",amazon
1/19/2017,Very cool! Even for an old timer.,amazon
1/27/2016,"I'd like nothing more than to keep this app but it's always crashing, and it's so slow that I think I'll save my self the trouble and further dissapointment. The music they have is great and that's why I got the app but it's just not worth it anymore.",amazon
12/16/2014,Lost my prime :(,amazon
8/7/2015,"The prime selection could be bigger but let's get real, the ability to listen offline really can't be beat. I don't plan on giving mine up anytime soon.",amazon
3/4/2016,Rocks!! I heard so many songs I hadn't even thought of in years. Got to enjoy lots of new jams also. Real easy app too.,amazon
7/21/2016,Great update to the logo as well as the service itself. The interface is much better now!,amazon
11/30/2016,Potentially the greatest app that I have ever downloaded it. Massive library! Never need to buy music again!,amazon
9/9/2016,"And I found out that now we have prime music!! I was disappointed that the Prime fee was going up, but now with Prime TV, exclusive HBO AND prime music....it's okay. I'm kind of missing some genres and there's no Marshall Mathers albums but that's okay because they are already in my cloud.",amazon
6/24/2014,"Easy to download, Great to have music so easy to access...Wish there was more choices on artist I like..",amazon
9/26/2016,AWESOME TO AUTO RIP MP3 DOWN LOAD IS FREE WHEN YOU BUY A CD WITH MP3 DOWNLOADABLE...,amazon
1/11/2017,Best music app on the market. I can listen to many good Christian songs and even download them on my phone through Wi-Fi to listen to later so I do not have to use my data.,amazon
12/6/2015,I'm not sure exactly to use is however when I try to find a song it always comes up.,amazon
12/18/2016,"I had to download this app just so I could download ONE SONG to my music player. I don't think I'll be buying music from Amazon again. Amazon rocks for everything I purchase though. And yes, I did uninstall Amazon music shortly after the song downloaded.",amazon
11/24/2014,"I understand I have to use this app in order to hear my music, but to start my music I need to first restart my phone. Not sure what's going on there? Other than that everything is fine.",amazon
9/25/2015,Great variety. Really enjoy several of the playlists.,amazon
9/10/2017,"Comparing to play music....prime has very slow load times, might be Wi-Fi connection. Unable to stream music with my 4g data, I've read that's a limitation prime has.",amazon
12/28/2015,it works well but it kept trying to charge? me for songs left and right when listening to a radio station that they have,amazon
7/14/2016,I have been playing lullabies to my new great granddaughter.She is now sound asleep.The lullabies are great.,amazon
9/4/2016,My music at my finger tips there's nothing like it. I download them straight to my MP3 player,amazon
8/1/2015,"I like being able to stream whole albums or individual songs on demand. I wish the stations functioned more like Slacker or Pandora, though, and I wish the library of available music was larger.",amazon
8/27/2015,"It's stupid because you have to be connected to the Internet. When I buy music, I don't want to pay for it twice by using my data. Let me download it.",amazon
3/2/2016,Listen every day,amazon
5/16/2016,"This wonderful is app is very effective and wonderful resource that I would recommend dnot using on a daily basis. This one many users as myself use day after day and while contine to use daya after day. Definitely not using it would be a trgedy;however, if you use will find it to be a wonderful tool. definitely add to to your phone or tablet or ipad if can be a very useful tool",amazon
3/1/2013,I am a Prime member but I can't use it outside of US !,amazon
7/19/2017,I would change this rating if I could play my Prime music from my sd card. I have allot of memory available but can't even use it. Even if I manually move the Prime downloads to my sd card. The music choice itself is awesome.,amazon
4/8/2015,"A good experience to have all that music in your back pocket. Seriously, I'm hookayed. Beware!",amazon
8/2/2015,"This app would not work on my RAZR...
 However, it works as intended (which is not to say smoothly) on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. My opinion has greatly improved since upgrading, but there is still a ballroom left for improvement...
 
 THE GOOD:
 *Prime Music - ""Free"" with Prime, I didn't have that feature when I subscribed, so it's a plus. I've found around 10 albums on Prime that I didn't already have, so I can listen for ""Free"" and see if I want to buy them permanently.
 *I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone.
 *Download for listening offline is great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without using data, perfect! Better than Pandora. This IS about the only positive point of the actual App...
 
 THE BAD:
 *Downloading/finding my purchased Amazon music is much harder than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music, but I don't see a way to do that.
 *Storage of offline listening music can't be moved, no option for it...
 *Doesn't resume play once app is shut down. This makes it a terrible music player. I don't really want the app running all the time, but that means I need to remember where I left off... This alone is worth 1 star.
 *I don't seem to be able to hide anything from it... I listen to one type of music, but I need to purchase other music here and there. I don't want that cluttering things up, but I am astounded at the lack of options in this app...
 
 You can do better Amazon...",amazon
10/1/2014,"Convention app but I wish thay had more popular songs on prime. I still use Pandora more, more of a selection, however, you dont know what song is playing next, cant go back or play the same song again.",amazon

4/20/2016,"Lots of current hits but, a nice splash for those of us born in the early 60's too",amazon
1/4/2017,It seems very hard to use the app..to get music is confusing..to store in cloud or download..very confusing,amazon
9/3/2016,It's a good variety of music and had some songs I liked that I forgot about.,amazon
9/29/2015,"A great selection of music, some of which I haven't heard in a long time (and miss) and quite a lot I've never heard. And the good thing about that is that I can experiment with new genres and if I don't like it - - no real loss, at least monetarily.",amazon
11/29/2014,There's no app for macs as far as I'm aware. There is a very limited selection of playlists to search.,amazon
9/23/2016,Grady app. Still has a few bugs. Randomly drops a song mid play sometimes. But great rotation off Music.,amazon
9/4/2016,"When I first downloaded the app it was great. There was a wide selection of music that I could stream integrated with my own music library, but after a few days it started to become glitchy. When I opened another music player, suddenly I couldn't see the song and artist in Amazon on my unlock screen anymore. Songs that I had downloaded to my library and listened to before would now go into endless buffer sessions. I Uninstaller and reinstalled the app, which worked for a few days, but the problems just keep reappearing.",amazon
6/28/2016,All the music I want at the same place. Just search what you want and it's there.,amazon
9/10/2017,set up playlists and play them all night for kids' or for me to sleep to...great!,amazon
1/29/2017,I really like the radio stations. Wish the selection of artist albums was larger.,amazon
12/24/2016,"Downloaded the app, but it won't play all the music in my library. Won't even recognize most of it. I can access from my kindle but not my android. And d***** thing, I can't even seem to 'reaquire' them purchasing them. That's kinda the whole point of having prime, right.?",amazon
8/16/2014,"I had purchased quite a few items that could be played on my new Android Phone. The app worked perfectly with totally clear sound.
 
 One thing I could wish for: In the case of complete albums, it would be nice to select from the artwork rather than scrolling endlessly through all the songs. I have 837 songs, mostly from complete albums. To go through that many to select one near the end of the list would be very time consuming. Just a thought.",amazon
3/7/2017,"Had a playlist over 40 hours of music. It stopped playing all Shinedown songs, had to delete playlist and start over.",amazon
7/17/2016,"Contrary to Amazon's claims this app is not compatible with the Acer A510. There is no access to playing music from ""the cloud"". I can browse my music and purchase music but forget playing music.
 
 Update - Turns out the issue is with the device. A reboot and the app works fine. This is also the case with a few other apps that were included on the device. So I'll be knocking a star of my Acer review.",amazon
7/23/2012,it is fantastic that you can have so many choice and catagories and then unlimited advance to next song. I bluetooth this through my new car speakers and bose blue tooth speakers.,amazon

11/3/2016,"I really like it but it stinks that I can't just transfer my music from iTunes right over to Amazon files.
 It says to do it but when I hit the button it doesn't do anything.

2/4/2016,Ive used a couple of apps for music but signing up for amazon music was worth it,amazon
1/12/2017,"Will not work on my first generation of Kindle fire HD. So disappointed that Amaon does not make it clear that their own product will not play their own app!! Makes no sense that there can not be an update, but I guess Amazon does not value their paying customers.",amazon
9/13/2014,"The music quality and ease of use are good, but managing the collection can be a problem. If the Imported music is not recognized you cannot manually Name it so I have hundreds of songs with no name or gibberish names!",amazon
4/2/2014,Song selection is awesome!! Any song country R&B soul classical it's there artist selection can't think of one that has never been there,amazon
4/19/2016,Disappointed only the primary Prime members can use Amazon Music. I share (household account) Prime membership with my husband and cannot use this app.,amazon
2/16/2016,According to this app only US and UK are English speaking. Somehow English (Australia) don't exist and the app refuses to run unless I change the whole system settings just for this one app. Not to mention the ridiculous amount of permissions. Guess what I did next amazon music devs?,amazon
6/14/2014,easy to navigate and use,amazon
5/29/2017,"I was never much of a music streamer, but this latest Prime add-on has made me a convert. I've only found a few albums/songs missing from the free catalog so far. ...And I've listened to so much music I'd always meant to hear.

6/27/2014,plays exactly the song I want to hear and can always find what I'm searching for!!,amazon
12/9/2016,"This is a great app for taking advantage of the 'Prime Music' benefit. The user interface is nice and intuitive, and accessing music is pretty easy. If you are searching for music and something is not prime eligible, then asks whether you want to purchase it. So no 1-click accidental purchases.
 
 The biggest drawback is that you cannot control where the app stores the downloaded files. This is a problem because it saves the downloads on the internal memory which has very limited room. If it weren't for this I would rate this app 5 stars.",amazon
7/27/2014,music is easy for an old guy to figure out and it has exactly what I like to listen to.,amazon

7/16/2013,Awesome to be able to have access to so much music. Only disappointment is that the service is constantly interrupted with service dropouts....,amazon
2/29/2016,Like the selection but when you try and download songs and then play them the app force closes....so I can't play music without streaming it.....please fix this!,amazon
10/18/2014,Thanks Team AMAZON!,amazon
6/6/2017,"I would of liked more music, the new songs you here on the radio are not here for the most part.",amazon
9/18/2016,Better than Pandora because you can listen to entire albums and playlists are ready available if you prefer not to compile your own. There are also playlists to choose by mood.,amazon
10/7/2015,"I like that there are no commercials, however a wider range of music would be nice. The stations sometimes play the same songs repeatedly.",amazon
3/17/2016,Good music selections for Free! The player works fine on my Android phone.,amazon
6/13/2017,Its the best no one can beat it,amazon
7/24/2017,"I enjoy the app, especially out on the boat were we don't have service. It's nice to have music downloaded to the phone. But the app is a bit cumbersome to use. Would like a better interface.",amazon
7/22/2015,"The app and selection are okay, no better than any of the other services out there. Since Amazon tries so hard to push Prime down your throat to use this service, I just give my money to Spotify.",amazon
7/22/2015,It tookay 3-4days to get some audio on my Flex! It had problems downloading SO I tried to get it to stop SO it wouldn't run all night NO luck! It finally STOPPED how no clue but it did Show in My Bill! Downloading Sucks!,amazon
3/25/2015,The best paid media app ever. I wish you could let me make 4 payments a year though:(,amazon
7/28/2015,I hate the way it's set up. i can't seem to search for the music i want. it seems like i have to scroll down through the available tracks. i'm a technophobe so i'm probably doing it wrong but there are plenty of people like me who want things to be simple and user-friendly.,amazon
7/2/2014,works really well!,amazon
7/16/2017,"Seems like whenever I want to access my music, which I directed to be local as well as in the cloud, I can't if the network connection is down. We were camping and had no cell service, so I could do nothing to access my music even with it downloaded. Major fail.",amazon
8/27/2014,Glad I discovered it. thanx to a free trial membership to amazon prime. In combination to prime video and prime shipping on orders it is well worth purchasing amazon prime membership,amazon
9/5/2015,It's a beautiful and very modern application.,amazon
7/18/2017,It should have a feature to shuffle stations not just listen to one genre,amazon
2/6/2017,It is wonderful to have every song that I can think of at my finger tips.,amazon

11/28/2014,Just okayay. Songs are removed from Prime without notice but will remain listed in your playlist.,amazon
9/16/2016,"I downloaded this app to replace the same app on my Pandigital tablet. The app became corrupt for some reason. It would not allow me to stream music and insisted I log in to my account. Of course my log in attempts met with a ""Fatal Flaw"" message. The Amazon help files were useless. So far I've had no problems with this app but I downloaded my favorite tunes to the tablet just in case.",amazon
11/6/2012,"I appreciate the Prime music, but streaming the songs can be very spotty, and skip. If I resort to downloading the songs, then I have no issues. Other than that, it's a simple app that could use some performance improvements.",amazon
2/20/2015,It is a good app.,amazon
7/19/2017,"There are a few artists/bands unavailable through the service. However, there is more than of enough music to rebuild my once compact disc collection. In conclusion, I am enjoying my experience via Amazon Music.",amazon
4/23/2015,This is how I get though work every day. The only problem I have is that the app tends to freeze or crash at least once a day.,amazon
5/2/2016,Gives me the ability to listen to any of my music from amazon. Works great.,amazon
12/7/2016,"Using this app on my Android would be great....if I could actually play music on it. I can navigate all the albums, artists, songs, etc., but when I tap play, I get an error. Every. Single. Time.
 
 The app has NEVER worked properly, unless I only want to navigate through all the songs and never actually listen to anything. In that regard, it's great.
 
 I contacted Amazon Customer Service who basically had me clear the app cache and data about 6 times and then removed all of my other devices from my account, to no avail. It's been 2 weeks and nothing has changed.
 
 I'm sorry to say: for an otherwise outstanding company, they failed me on this one.
 
 UPDATE - I got a new phone and I don't have any of the above issues.",amazon
2/14/2015,I used to listen to Pandora but now I have switched to amazon music. It's great that it's free with the prime membership!,amazon

7/18/2016,"The selection is good, but wish their was more of a variety to pick from",amazon
1/9/2017,This app makes it easy to listen to my prime music on my phone. It has all my albums ready to listen to.,amazon
5/14/2015,I enjoy this feature of Prime. My only complaint is that many of the same sings overlap on various stations. the streaming music does help introduce songs that I may not otherwise hear.,amazon
8/8/2015,"Will not install on Nookay HD+. Amazon MP3 player worked fine. Now with the new app I have no way to access all my legal Amazon MP3 files on my Nookay. What a way to treat customers.
 
 Wish there were a way to get the old Amazon MP3 player app back.",amazon
9/12/2014,I'm so happy with this app. I can listen all day long without annoying ads.,amazon
12/6/2016,Awesome being a prime member with this free music downloads. They could have include the new music for free for being a member.,amazon
4/25/2016,"Happy that Amazon was able to have monthly installment plan, instead of a full payment right away. Thanks amazon!!! 4 caring!!!!",amazon
4/20/2016,"There are three ways to store your music device, cloud, library and they do not cooperate well. Many downlod very fail. Try another music provider first. If I did not already own music on Amazon, I would not use this app.",amazon
2/10/2015,This app has been a huge hit with my kids. They each can personalize the listening experience to their preference. Thanks Amazon!,amazon
4/25/2016,"The Android app is good, what I do not like is that there is almost no songs compared to other companies underwriting.",amazon
6/1/2016,I don't like that I can listen to my songs on Amazon offline when I have playlist that's on my Amazon acct I should have access to the playlist offline as far as I know I'm not able to download a playlist to my music device that I can play online or offline.,amazon
8/29/2014,By far the best music app I have ever used. Thank you Amazon. Good Job.,amazon
10/19/2017,Could be better can't down load new music with out another subscription,amazon
9/1/2017,The song limit is crazy. Other cloud storages like Google don't charge.,amazon
12/25/2016,Like it much better than spotify. Easier to use. Better sound quality.,amazon
1/25/2017,"I need to play around with Amazon Prime music some more, to figure it out, but my initial reaction is not positive. My breakdown after 1 day or so lookaying at it:
 
 I found it difficult to navigate the app, particularly with respect to what is included as Prime Streaming and what is not. More specifically, it's frustrating that the ""Prime"" (i.e., no additional cost) music is sort of mixed in with all the stuff that is for purchase.
 
 With Google Play Music, it takes some effort to actually go and purchase something. Basically what you find in Google Play Music streaming is available to you for unlimited streaming and included in your subscription cost.
 
 With this service, I'm wary that I might click on something and end up buying it. Maybe that is the point, really.
 
 Amazon needs to clearly separate the ""free"" (i.e.included in Prime subscription) streaming music from the rest for this app to be very useful.",amazon
6/20/2014,Will not work with Samsung Galaxy 6 does not install or update just keep saying install pending,amazon
9/8/2016,Hardly had any of the smaller bands that I like.,amazon
11/23/2015,Exclusive App - AAA+++ Rating,amazon
7/27/2017,I don't understand why I cant get the app to show up on my phone. I had no problem on my i pad but my android and prime music don't hit it off. Amazon needs to fix this. If I had read the reviews on-line I might never have gone for Prime Music. Beware.,amazon
9/30/2014,I keep getting an error message when I try to open the app. saying it can't authenticate my phone. Purchased music that I cant even listen to. :(,amazon
2/1/2016,Would be rated five stars if more than one person could sign on at the same time.,amazon
11/6/2016,I have prime student trial and no music. That's what I use the most when I study,amazon
11/9/2016,"This is a nice enhancement to the ""Prime"" package. Already loaded up my phone with tunes that I don't have in my collection already. I hope Amazon keeps adding features like this to the Prime membership. I wonder if they will ever add Audio Bookays to it? <-hint*",amazon
6/20/2014,Had no problems at all and it was simple. It didn't take long at all to install. I kept my music on track with my computer so It worked great.,amazon
3/21/2016,I have a Motorola Droid 1080x. This totally messed up my whole music library. Be very sure you want to download this!,amazon

11/21/2014,No thanks. You're selection isn't there yet. My favorites are Tool and Radiohead which are not available. I'll keep it in hopes you get better artists like The Beatles or Pink Floyd and please don't try and cram bad music down my throat such as Christian or County or pop,amazon
6/18/2014,"The iPhone app is very functional (although the ""sign up"" process was a little confusing). The amount of prime music available is impressive but the length, variety and number of the preset playlists are lacking. Still a great addition to the prime membership.",amazon
7/2/2014,App won't work on galaxy s6 edge plus. Won't update in either play store or Amazon app store,amazon
9/16/2016,Great experience so far....lots of choices and fin to create playlists.,amazon

11/19/2015,"It's a good app, not the best app for streaming as it crashes from time to time on the OnePlus Two. But when it works, it is nice to have access to all the prime music.",amazon
10/15/2015,"Maybe the app is good, maybe it isn't--Amazon Prime Music isn't designed to be compatible with my older Android device and Spotify is, so that makes for an easy decision. If you're interested in subscribing to Prime based on the music service, be sure to check your specs.",amazon

4/30/2015,Very good app.,amazon
5/1/2017,"I never thought I'd ever need to give such a negative review to anything Amazon sells much less one of their products but this latest ""upgrade"" of Amazon Music has been a major disappointment to this user/ customer. My major complaint is the inability to upload songs from my laptop to Amazon Music. I've tried numerous times and all I get is the screen with the new logo on it and nothing else. The screen just stares back at me mockingly smirking.",amazon
10/29/2016,Not running. Error &#34;The specified device coul not be authenticated&#34; Exception #45. I send a report to support but nothing happens.,amazon
1/13/2016,Better than the one that was pre-installed on my phone. A keeper although I don't use much. (yet),amazon
8/23/2016,"When I placed my order the screen went right to the final summary. I didn't know what charge card was used. I put in my new address, but the order was sent to my old address.

 Now what do I do?",amazon

7/27/2016,I downloaded three days ago. It has yet to let me use it. Waste of my time!,amazon
11/20/2016,It is nice to buy music and have it available and any device that you have (thanks to amazon cloud) with internet connection. You can also use it with other mp3 files you have on your sister. The only negative happened to me last week when I went to a remote area for a relax mini vacation and my cel phone didn't have internet. But that is life,amazon
6/14/2013,Great app with great variety and easy to use interface.,amazon

10/4/2014,"These are my initial thoughts after using Amazon Mp3 app fro few hours
 
 Must
 1) Lacks Genre tab in the player
 2) Lacks a bigger widget with cover art
 3) Lacks a lock screen control with cover art
 4) Splits up an album if there are different singers on it, this is pointless. Merge it to the album name.
 5) Lacks support to upload folders instead of files
 
 Luxury
 1) Add an equalizer
 2) Add share feature to share via facebookay/twitter.
 3) iPhone, iPad app :)",amazon
3/29/2011,Not sure what the problem is but sure is a lot of static Cuts in and out,amazon
12/5/2016,Always hear of this app but never tried until now I regret how could I miss this great feature amazon prime gives. So nice job there I can enjoy more of amazon and keep it up.,amazon
9/13/2015,Have had no problems. It is especially nice to have when Internet is slow and Pandora and or iheart radio do not work as this still works. I have used for about w years on a galaxy S3 and just transferred it to a S5 it is still working well.,amazon
11/7/2014,Good selection of songs available for your enjoyment.,amazon

1/21/2017,Putting my Prime Music on my phone for the gym. Ton of free tunes.,amazon
1/4/2017,Ridiculous amount of crashes on my devices running Android 4.4.4. Have tried installing from Amazon App store and Google play store. This app should be considered alpha and not be released to the general public until it has been fixed.,amazon

2/4/2016,Works perfectly for me on my phone and tablet. A lot of songs to choose from. Plus it is included in the price of your prime membership.,amazon
2/8/2016,"When i first signed up 2 years ago...it was consistant...performed on the go and worked amazing. Ever sine the updates it is choppy,freezes, and just isnt worth the monthy charge for the cloud. I have stuck woth it in hopes to see smoother running, but it seems amazon has allowed their competitors to surpass them and put out better players.",amazon
6/5/2013,Great app to search for music especially if you are a prime member.,amazon
12/13/2016,This app drained my battery! I had no choice but to remove it. Also I would save songs to the cloud playlist and they would not be saved,amazon
2/16/2016,Only use this to listen to Taylor Swift since she is no longer on Spotify.,amazon
11/13/2016,It stops just short of being on par with another company's Music Offering. But I have to say that the library is vast and the cloud streaming is awesome. This alone makes signing up for Amazon Prime a perfect Christmas gift for someone.,amazon

9/21/2015,"Amazon Prime is worth every dime, and it quickly pays for itself. Obviously postage is saved, though additional benefits (i.e. music, movies, etc) make it an invaluable tool I certainly wouldn't want to be without.",amazon
2/23/2015,"Down loaded the app and found out it uses a lot of memory about the same amount as the whole Operating System on the phone. Didn't like that amount of memory usage. The phone seemed to slow down and the app itself locked up more than I liked. Also noticed it wanted access to a lot of areas on the phone it didn't need to access. Didn't like that at all as it's giving away my data usage and increasing my costs for data uploading data I don't want to give away. Then found out I couldn't delete it or uninstall it. That made me determined to remove it. Which I did by wiping the phone and reloading it. Amazon you want to much information, photos, media info etc. You are increasing my data rates with needless uploads I don't need to give you and you don't need. All that just to hear music no thanks there are better ways out there.On top of that the app isn't very intuitive to use. I won't be reloading it, and would suggest avoiding it, as it's a memory hog and bloats your data rate needlessly.",amazon

10/23/2015,There should be a way to keep from buying music accidentally. I have a child and my phone is locked but even the regular Amazon shopping app has the ability to turn off one click buying and probably for a password. Not everything is free with Prime.,amazon

8/3/2014,There are a lot more free albums and songs than I could have hoped for.,amazon
8/4/2015,"Unfortunately, I cannot rate this fairly. I was trying to sync my music library to my new cell phone. I really don't know anything
 about this Prime Music app.",amazon
9/26/2015,Very good selection. Just don't like how every station plays the same 50 songs,amazon
10/9/2016,"Anything you want to hear, anytime you want to hear it. One the best benefits of Prime. Let's face it, the FREE 2 Shipping cannot be beat! Their pre-made Playlists are right on the money.",amazon
6/14/2015,"It was a bit difficult to negotiate. I wanted to be able to find particular songs more easily. This is somebody who's just begun using it, so no doubt there is a learning curve. So glad I chose to save my songs to Amazon's cloud, though, because it's not eating up memory and I won't lose them no matter what happens to my devices.",amazon
6/20/2013,"Seems have a lot of great features and variety, but I have used Spotify for so long that I am going to stick with it. Plus it is connected to my Facebookay account.",amazon
10/7/2015,"Great Benefit of Prime Membership. Can't beat FREE music. Current Hits and Oldies. 5 stars for selection, channels and genre",amazon

1/28/2017,amazon streaming music does not work on my kindle. And you cant download the app. ive tried the mp3 app on my android its more trouble than its worth no sdcard so i sideload or use dropbox. no app at all for my windows phone. I don't think they get it.,amazon
7/20/2014,"Only had it for a short time, but so far I'm really happy. I like being able to use my phone if I'm out in the field to listen to music!",amazon
2/2/2016,This service streams well and is very quick. If they have the artists you like on Prime your in good shape. I have been fortunate so far as a lot of my favorites have been free. All things considered a great service so far.,amazon
12/23/2014,"All of my favorite music, commercial free, and all part of my Prime membership.",amazon
10/2/2016,"I like how easy this is to use with my Android. The free music is awesome--especially some of the playlists; I was introduced to new, beautiful music through some of those. I would definitely recommend it to a friend!",amazon
6/26/2014,"Fast and easy, but missing some very important and/or new artists.",amazon
8/18/2015,This app shows it has been downloading one song for 1.5 hrs. As you can see i can be very patient preson but this is rediculious. I will try later when i have more time to call technical support and have 10.3 Blackberry software.,amazon
11/23/2014,"Drained my phones battery, always on, used up 2gb data by itself in the span of an hour. Music is hard to get transfered over to it even when bought from the website... really not pleased",amazon

4/19/2016,Great sounds more than I can ever listen to....Life is Good...,amazon
12/12/2016,"Honestly, app is difficult to navigate. No good music available. Needs some major work. Needs at least some new music. Integration between links very slow. I use raphsody, pandora, and slacker. This ranks below all of them, for now.",amazon
11/7/2014,Slow to load but very convenient. I do have a large collection to load but Amazon tech service said that's not the reason it's slow. They did not say what IS the cause.,amazon
9/6/2015,"I prefer buying my Android tracks here because there's no confusion about downloading what you purchase. It's a simple, user friendly app I come back to time and time again!",amazon
8/15/2015,"It's a great service, don't get me wrong, but it would be greater if we could create separate user profiles so a parent could see their recommendations and a kid could see theirs, as an example.",amazon
5/11/2015,I really like it but is it costing me money???,amazon
8/2/2017,some of the functions were difficult to learn to use. okayay now that i am use to it. missing lots of music i had wished would be there,amazon

4/12/2016,i dont recall ordering this i didont or will not be using it,amazon
12/24/2016,It's nice that a lot of music is free but even with the download feature you can't play the downloaded music with other players that you may like better. The phone use to not be able to sleep while playing music but they fixed that in a recent update.,amazon
8/1/2014,"Well I pay for Amazon prime and can not use the player, keeps giving me error codes",amazon

10/17/2017,This app is not compatible. I downloaded it but it won't play any music. I have to save the music from amazon music to my phone and play it on the phones music player. Very disappointed. This phone is not old it's new in 2014.,amazon
11/29/2014,So easy to use and has sooo many songs to listen to. I am loving it..,amazon
11/2/2016,Can't stream music from the cloud unlees you uninstall and reinstall the app. Talked with tech support a few times they have no explanation. I stream from several other places and have no problems.,amazon
4/21/2015,Amazon Prime Music allows free cloud storage which is simply awesome! Great for this Memorial Day cookayout.,amazon
5/30/2016,"I don't care for this at all, I was interested but when I wanted to listen to a song it wanted me to download an app. okayay fine, however then the app says it can make all these changes to my phone. Not okayay.",amazon
2/23/2015,Wanted me to provide credit card details before even getting started,amazon
11/9/2016,"This app started out okayay for my purpose. I bought the music, it went to the app, and from there I was able to download it down to my phones music player. Until after a couple of hours of getting music. Now none of my purchases go threw.",amazon
9/22/2014,I Bluetooth my music to a speaker outside and it is continual play and I can select genres for a variety of people.,amazon
4/19/2016,I also have Rhapsody and in my opinion Amazon Music is superior.,amazon

2/15/2016,"It's nice having a library, great being able to put things I like directly into it. The playlist are lacking in my opinion, but that could easily be remedied if I tookay the time into making my own.",amazon
4/23/2015,Easy to use but i wish the interface was easier and friendly to use as it is really ugly,amazon
8/13/2016,I don't need another music player. I just want to download my music onto my devices and play it. I do not need or want to be connected to any cloud.,amazon
9/23/2014,Better than pandora hands down,amazon
7/18/2017,Great way to get all your music without spending a fortune,amazon
2/10/2017,On many occasions the music of my choice was not available,amazon
1/30/2017,Excellent APP and very easy to use. Great music selection!,amazon

5/16/2016,had issues with poor reception on LG phone. Now incompatible with Samsung phone...FRUSTRATION...Now Amazon account still reflects LG phone and won't update with new Samsung info...more FRUSTRATION... Now I can access music from cloud but only on pc ...then must transfer ... more frustration and irritation...,amazon
10/8/2013,"New to Amazon music, I would like to see a guide to explain what is the difference between all the options",amazon
5/24/2016,I really enjoy the Playlist options and just need more time to learn how to navigate the site faster. I'm not very savvy about this kind of site (I'm 52 with minimal exposure to such sites). My only regret is not downloading the app sooner!,amazon
9/6/2014,I ditched my Sirius subscription in favor of this. I believe I made an excellent choice. Now I get to choose the music I listen to with the added benefit of being able watch movies for free and have Amazonprime purchases shipped to me free.,amazon
9/6/2014,Some free music. Confusing trying to negotiate back to your choices and selections. Constantly interrupted by attempts to sell totally unwanted music. You can do better amazon. Google Play is much better.,amazon
2/20/2015,"A lot of the music is outdated or is just not losted. I can hear numerous of the ""new"" tracks on the radio 2 weeks before.",amazon
2/5/2016,I did not dislike the music I think it new more update songs and artists.,amazon

7/8/2016,"I do like the free music that comes with prime, but this app feels a bit buggy and kind of slow. Also the selection of prime music is not very good, but I guess that's expected.",amazon
7/13/2015,Prime Music is definitely a great place to find what you are lookaying for and so many of my favorite artists and music is there.,amazon
2/17/2016,I am really enjoying my play list. The song selections are great with various choices. Download streaming from the Bluetooth and listening thru the radio.,amazon
10/22/2015,"This is the best way to play your favorite tunes with or without WiFi. You buy your music (the prices are very reasonable- to cheap) you download IF you want it on your device for anytime, anyplace listening. Or you can leave your tunes safe in the cloud so it does not take up any storage, you start the wireless and listen that way. Either way, the selection is nearly infinite. All the old classics to the newest hits....And best of all; NO Commercials! And you don't have to listen to anything except what you want to hear. For listening on your phone or tablet, this is the real deal. No hidden fees. No upgrades. Just straight out jamming Your Way!",amazon
12/3/2013,"I really like this music service, pretty good library and no adds. It allows me to download to SD card which is great. Great addition for Prime.",amazon
12/3/2015,Have not used this as much as I should. But I do like the selection of music and themes.,amazon
8/1/2016,"When I ordered this app I thought it was compatible with my Kindle Fire HD....
 Unfortunately it wasn't, none the less to my surprise it works great on my smart phone! The loss of one star is for not being compatible with my Kindle Fire. I do recommend this app for any smart phone with the Android operating system! :)",amazon
6/20/2013,"Amazon Music does not create a radio feel, unlike Pandora I have to waste time creating my own stations and hence never get a chance to find new music.",amazon

1/7/2017,the mobile app stops playing requiring numerous restarts,amazon
1/19/2017,Needs work on being user friendly,amazon
11/23/2015,"It's not all that sophisticated of an App, but it serves the purpose. But it works great for me because I use several phones (one for each region I frequently travel to) and it's nice to have my music with me whenever I want to play them. Best part of it is I don't have to load down the already limited memory of my phones with the entire library. I can just stream the playlist (or artist, album, etc.) that I want to listen to.",amazon
8/16/2011,I don't even understand why I would need a music app on my kindle it should just register my prime account on the music tab. no matter though because the app won't even install onto my tablet. SMH,amazon
4/10/2015,"What the hell is this? A specific recording? Any of them? The Music app on Android??? I've never played any music via Amazon, sooooo......",amazon
12/8/2015,Doesnt stream. Can only use it at home and does not work all the time at home either,amazon
5/23/2015,"Pandora and Iheart have nothing on Amazon Prime Music. Music is new, you can create your kwn playlists and cloud library. Stations are amazing.",amazon

4/28/2016,"I have enjoyed using this app. I have the sirius app also. In the gym, sirius does not always work. Amazon music seems to come in at all times with little service interruption.",amazon

1/16/2017,"It's fabulous! A space taker for sure but other than that, it's great to have a song pop in to your head and voila there it is!!",amazon
2/4/2016,It is pretty nice. The down side is you have to have coverage or the music won't play.It is not downloaded to your phone but rather streamed through it.,amazon
10/22/2015,Very good mix,amazon
7/20/2017,"This is something I really enjoy. I don't listen all the time, but there are many occasions when I just want to listen to my own favorites. I like it that I can listen to my music with my smart phone. I can see the day coming when I don't care to even have a cd. I like the convenience and the simplicity of pulling my music from the cloud.",amazon
3/12/2013,"The music selection has a fair number that I like, but the biggest drawback for me is the app for my Android tablet. It has no shuffle play within a disc and no shuffle play across discs. I was hoping for a mini radio station with only my chosen artists.",amazon
6/15/2014,LOVIN IT,amazon
6/29/2015,This thing is awesome!!! So much better than Pandora and free!!!!,amazon
7/30/2015,"I think it's better then all other services
 Simple to work with for selecting songs and stations",amazon

11/26/2016,I added it to my Samsung phone and now can listen anywhere.... just wish I could figure out how to get something like this on my Kindle. I know there is a way but can't figure it out yet. Managing the music on Amazon Prime on my home computer is a snap.,amazon
6/23/2014,Great service. Saves all my purchases got future downloads.,amazon

I can easily access the cloud music from my PC.......phone doisn't know that it exists....just keeps telling my the my password is not valid.,amazon
1/6/2014,Really good overall app.,amazon
7/8/2017,"I give this app a -10 (minus 10). It crashes constantly. I can be surfing the Web on my phone or checking my email without listening to music and it crashes interrupting what I'm doing. Tech support says uninstall the app. But when I do this it deletes all the music I downloaded. Then it takes time to redownload my music(have over 3500 songs) mainly full CD's. And not having internet at home this causes problems. Last time I did this it hijacked over 500 songs from another music from my other music player along with duplicating 300 of them(over 800 additional on my SD card). So I hesitate to uninstall it again for fear of losing my songs from the other music player. In addition I now have I have several CD'so that I purcased from Amazon that are now on my other music player. When it crashes if I don't select report the crash the music still plays, however I can't see what's playing.
 
  I have a Samsung S4 with 16GB internal and a 64GB SD card. Found the best work around is to force a stop on the app and delete cache, restart the phone then try again to play music.
 
 Is this anyway to listen to your music? DON'T THINK SO!!!! Wish they could get their act together!!!!",amazon
4/4/2016,"Excellent! I am able to use it at the office on my laptop, the selection is great, easy to use, and I highly recommend it!",amazon

8/6/2016,"This music streams so well, it is like having all these CD's in your own home,car or office without having to lug them around. The best deal I have gotten for myself in a long time.",amazon
5/29/2015,"Good movie! Changed the whole timeline and set the franchise up for a whole new series, either movies or tv.",amazon
4/19/2016,"Company is good and, I wouldn't mine working for them. It's been super. I wouldn't mine a little more transparency when it comes to product reviews and possibly offer some deals like no interest if the product is paid off during a pre determined period of time.",amazon
4/23/2014,"Great way to listen purchased on songs from Amazon. Not sure if it will be accepting of any MP3 - never required it... However, it's one way to stream MP3's purchased on Apple (no file system) such as an iPad...!!",amazon
12/11/2014,We have one prime account for the house and each have our own login. Unfortunately only one us us can use it and that one person isn't me.,amazon
12/1/2015,"Good selection, not great..still need other sources for most of my music. I would pay for Youtube once this is over.",amazon
3/11/2016,"So Amazon has refused to let me continue selling product on their site (after 10 years of allowing me to),even thought I have provided copies of my invoices, as I sell from multiple locations... the address on the invoice doesn't match the address on the seller account.
 As 'compensation' for this, they offered me a $300 'credit' on black friday goods. The items were picked, and all that was left was my payment for the difference in price.
 The agent who was working on this... stopped responding via email.
 The agent who was chatting.... stopped responding to chat.
 
 So, I am left with product I cannot sell.... and the empty promise of compensation that will never happen.
 
 In the meantime, Amazon continues to lose money, and business in general.... and we wonder why?",amazon
12/6/2014,Too money hungry nothing for the user,amazon
8/24/2017,The music is of high quality and all new music are available.,amazon
11/7/2016,So far good. Haven't had the time for adding songs,amazon
1/3/2017,Will not download properly cannot open it or videos,amazon
1/12/2017,"I enjoy having amazon music app.,can't lose my songs,if I lose my phone, I jus re-download all my new songs to the new phone I get,thankz Amazon,00)",amazon
10/22/2015,The amazon music app is exactly what I was expecting pertaining to retrieving the music that I would like to listen and considering purchasing. I haven't really had any complaints about it and since I mainly have android devices I'm digging the cloud player that I can use for my purchases as well as the current content that is featured on each of my android devices.,amazon
9/21/2012,"I like it, but they do not have as much music to choose from as some of the other streaming services.",amazon
5/17/2016,Lots of music choices. Plus songs can be downloaded so you're not having to use Data while listening.,amazon
5/17/2016,"Uninstalled, I dont like it to be always on, even if you restart the phone.",amazon
9/6/2016,I've enjoyed the music I've gotten. It sounds really good. But I am still trying to figure out how I can listen to my music when I'm offline.,amazon
11/21/2015,"I haven't used this service much so my impressions are just prreliminary. The interface is not intutive and there doesn't seem to be much help. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I was unable to locate music that should have been obvious. The Beatles, Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell, etc. The music that seem to come up in the playlists is all new (2000 to now) stuff that I've never heard of. Not that I stay on top of modern music much (I'm 61). I might fool around with it some more to make sure I'm not doing something wrong but if I can't get the music I'm interested in I don't see the point. I already have Pandora and all my music library on my phone. I appreicate it that Amazon gave us Prime members something for free but for me the jury is still out on how much a benefit it will be.",amazon
6/17/2014,Without Chromecast support this is just another portion of amazon prime that locks you into buying Kindles and Fire TV. It's a lack of flexibility like this that has kept me away from Apple lately.,amazon
3/11/2015,Amazon continues to surprise me with excellence. Amazon Prime Music is enriching each day with album listening that hasn't been so convenient and available. Worth the Prime membership itself.,amazon

My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebookay knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it? I'm starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more.",amazon

12/22/2015,"I have long preferred Amazon to iTunes for buying mp3 primarily for the selection but also the prices.

2/8/2016,Amazon music and prime is perfect match for me..,amazon
11/11/2016,"Its not very smooth as in song choosing/playing. Kind of a bit more of a task to get it going then other music players of this type. Also if your on the prime music membership program, not all songs are available free. Lame if you ask me",amazon

4/19/2016,This was the most confusing experience in trying to gain access to an app that I have ever gone through. Do not recommend this at all.,amazon
10/24/2015,Downloaded but didn't install. This app wanted access permission to too many areas and data on my phone which isn't necessary.,amazon
12/2/2015,Great music! Amazon poems music even consists of newer Songs and albums! Very satisfied,amazon
5/19/2016,I've not had any problems except when doing multiple downloads. The ability to have almost any song you can think of or any artist is really nice. This is just another great benefit of being a prime member.Thanks Amazon!!!,amazon
9/2/2014,"we have tablets for the kids, and us. we also have a home computer and two smartphones. this app allows us to use the cloud to move all the music we bought to all of our devices. each person can choose the individual songs they want downloaded to there own device.",amazon

2/17/2016,"This is great! I joined Prime last Christmas when I was doing my Christmas shopping to get the free shipping on a number of items. I month later I got the bill for $99.00 for a year. I thought OUCH! Then I started lookaying into it. I was able to create play lists of my favorite music on my lap top and, after downloading the app, onto my cell-phone. I was able to log into Amazon Prime at work and play my type music for free on my work computer. At work I have no CD/DVD drive at work, this makes it difficult to listen to my kind of music to be more productive. I haven't really even started with the videos.",amazon

10/15/2015,"Selection of music is okayay, but the policy that a household member (not the original prime member) can not use the service doesn't make lot of sense.",amazon
8/9/2015,I think this is s great service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because a couple of artists/albums I searched for weren't available.,amazon

11/6/2016,Works extremely well. Great seleection of music,amazon

7/28/2016,"This is now my go-to music app. Has all of my Amazon prime music (which can be DLed for use offline!), and manages my mp3s that are loaded as well. Better than Google's music app, to me.",amazon
2/3/2015,Average at best. The Prime Stations are difficult to turn off. It seems it has to be paused and then delete it with the phone's task manager.,amazon
9/7/2015,Still limited.. hope they add more to it.,amazon
8/20/2015,"Great Music, but need to have more artists on Prime that are free. Amazon Prime should also allow more than 1 person to be using it at a time, as my wife & I have to take turns listening on our devices.",amazon
11/20/2014,Ever since i started using amazon prime im very excited with all this great music ..definitely passing the word on to friends and family,amazon
10/2/2015,I only listen to music on this app. Its great!,amazon
11/7/2016,This app will not work on my Kindle.,amazon
9/27/2017,It is supposed to be Android compatible but it doesn't work on my phone. I'll admit I have an older phone 2-3 year old HTC Thunderbolt running Cyanogenmod 7.1.1 and it loaded Amazon MP3 player instead. So I cannot use this app at all.,amazon
6/20/2014,"I like this app for the most part.I have used the PC version for Windows, the iPad app, and the Android app for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Over all it performs well enough, but i do have a few gripes about it.
 
 First complaint is where is the version for the Fire TV? I'm using the app on an Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft device, but Amazon hasn't got a version yet for their own device?? I keep hearing soon, but soon is never soon enough!
 
 My next complaint is with editing songs/albums you have uploaded to the cloud. As with the Amazon MP3 app that this app replaced there is no way to edit album art. I have over 15,000 songs uploaded to the Amazon Cloud Player and a number of them don't have the correct album cover art. Some have no album art at all even though all my songs/albums have a high quality image embedded in the MP3 file itself. If the mobile apps can't do this so be it, but you should at least be able to copy/paste your own album art on a PC or Mac similar to Google Play Music , iTunes, etc.
 
 I also cant seem to stream any music via 3G/4G without constant buffering, so i have to make sure I remember to download music via Wi-Fi before leaving the house. I don't believe this is a limitation of the app, but has more to do with my cell carrier (Sprint) in my area. I also can't stream from Spotify either so it's more of a network issue.
 
 I also don't like the fact that you have to add anything you want to play for the Prime Music selection to your library before you can play it. I use services like Spotify, Slacker, and Amazon Music to discover bands as well as play music I already know, so I don't want to add music to my library that I might not even like. We should be able to play the music and then add to our personal library if it turns out you like it.
 
 Otherwise I think its a good app with much potential. The GUI is nice enough and easy to use. I expect Amazon, with their deep pockets, to sign more music labels and make more music available for Prime members in the future, but the selection isn't bad considering Prime Music just launched about 3 weeks ago. Still has a ways to go to reach Spotify's catalog of songs/artists/albums.",amazon

12/10/2016,"I just started using because it was in my Prime membership. So, why not - right?
 
 It surprised me in a good way! The app has been updated, so it runs pretty smoothly in Android. It has a decent quality in streaming, but I recommend downloading and playing offline your favorite music. The audio quality will be top!
 
 The desktop app is basically Spotify with an Amazon skin. So, you know what to expect.
 
 Unfortunately, my cars don't have a link to this app, so I only have basic controls over Bluetooth - which is not bad at least, but not perfect. However, nothing that makes me stop using it.
 
 If you're Prime, this is a must use!",amazon
6/21/2016,I have several music apps on my phone but Amazon music is the only one that gets used. It is so convenient and the playlists have music I actually want to hear. Great value with my prime membership.,amazon

5/19/2012,It might just be me but I find this app confusing. I have problems organizing my lists and I can't figure out how to get rid of music I downloaded and decided I don't want. It is functional though and I will continue to use it.,amazon

2/10/2017,"Good alternative to radio stations especially if you do not want to deal with ads. Prime members should take advantage of the free music streaming that Amazon provides! I haven't yet streamed music with the Amazon Music app without wifi yet, but so far it has been relatively smooth and the audio is high quality.
 The only downside is that it seems you would have to choose another playlist once the current one is finished, or else the music just stops. It is only a drawback because I like to listen to music for long periods of time and it is a bit bothersome to constantly pick another playlist once one is over.",amazon

 Whoppie! This is awesome!
 I'm downloading whole albums of Blues, Jazz, and whatever else I want for free.

 Additionally, I can no longer skip back a small amount to listen to part of the song again. When I try now, it skips back to the beginning of the song so I have to listen to the whole song again. It's like a super cheap MP3 player. I pay for cloud storage to listen to songs on the go, but the app now makes it difficult.",amazon

I get error messages constantly, I can't download items or delete items with the app freezing and its even screwing up the album cover thumbnail with the artist (putting a Beatles album cover with a Rolling Stones album for example).

12/4/2014,"Under normal circumstances this app deserves a good solid 4 stars. With the newest version however, I have to downgrade my assessment and take away 2 of those stars because what should be a standard feature of any music player no longer works. The newest version breaks the shuffle feature almost completely- especially if you have amassed a library with thousands of songs.
 
 In the old version, when you toggled the shuffle feature, your songs would be played in a somewhat random fashion- as should be expected. In this new version, when you toggle the shuffle feature, a contiguous block of up to 500 songs is automatically selected, and it is only from within that block of songs that there is any randomization. I don't find this acceptable in the slightest.
 
 I like the new ""Play Queue"" feature, however when I enable the shuffle feature, I expect a play queue to be built that is completely random and could possibly include any of the songs in my library, not just a contiguous chunk of 500 songs.",amazon

11/22/2016,"I pay $25 a year to be able to store all my music in the Amazon cloud, and I'm very happy to be able to listen to my music at home, at work, or, with this app, anyplace I've got a 4G or Wi-Fi signal.
 
 So far, so good.
 
 But, there are horrible limitations with this app that Amazon could easily fix, if they wanted to:
 
 1) It won't download music to your SD card
 I bought a 64GB SD card so I could listen to my music when I didn't have a connection (and also so I wouldn't have to worry about using too much data).
 But when it downloads music it goes to your phone's internal memory, and can't be set to use an SD card. Why? Why? Why? My Galaxy Note II has just 16GB of internal memory, which is needed for programs, etc. There is not much space to store a bunch of music. That's why I bought the SD card (from Amazon!). Google Music let's you download to SD - you can too!
 
 2) It will let you download your music, but still streams it from the cloud
 I was enjoying listening to my music from the Amazon cloud so much that I was pushing against my Verizon data limits. No problem, I thought, I'll just use the handy download function in the app. So, before a big car trip I created a playlist and clicked the download button. On the drive I pulled up the playlist and started to play it. Everything seemed great until I lost the 4G signal and the music stopped. What happened? Hadn't I downloaded the songs? Well, yes, the songs had downloaded to my phone, but the stupid Amazon MP3 player was still streaming the songs over the Internet, even though it ""knew"" that it had already downloaded them all. Stupid!
 
 3) No gapless playback.
 Try listening to Dark Side of the Moon or Abbey Road with gaps between all the songs and it just ruins the experience.",amazon
12/17/2013,"Excellent service, excellent choices",amazon
9/16/2016,"I needed music for a party for my coworkers retirement. They put me in charge of getting music and I was easily able to find it here on Amazon. That in itself is a blessing. Once I purchased the music I needed, I needed to download this app in order to play it. Normally this would suck and I would hate it but it's made everything so much easier. So I downloaded this app and it has the music that I have purchased right there. I can download the music on my phone so that when I am in the party, it's not using my data in order to play it. It can just play from my phone. I like that part. I have downloaded the music that I purchased and created an album to play my music through for the party so it's easily accessible and ready for use. It also adds my songs that I currently have on my phone so I don't have to manually switch those over. Overall this is a great app, especially if you have prime. There are a lot of songs that you can get for free because of prime.",amazon
8/19/2016,"The only reason I got this application was because I wanted to buy ONE mp3 album through Amazon mobile. But after browsing the selection I end up downloading FIVE mp3 albums.

8/6/2015,"A very good product because it lets you find songs and albums and lets you listen to it as much as you like... and all this is included with prime. I recently heard a song that triggered so much memories for me I was thinking of going to buy the whole album again. Luckily, the song and the whole album was available on Prime Music (whereas it was not available in the other music streaming services). I was able to download into my phone, and down memory lane we went! What's nice is that the whole album is still available off line after downloading the songs! Highly recommend this service!",amazon
9/25/2016,Good Tunes!!!!!,amazon

10/3/2016,"Performance-wise, the app delivers music with good speed and quality, and the prime music selection is pretty solid. The user interface has a tendency to feel clunky and at times counter-intuitive. Search algorithm should be better optimized. As-is, the system often just displays all the covers available through prime music without mentioning the original artist. This leaves the user wondering if the search went wrong. When someone searches for a song, it should display the original artist first, with track availability (unavailable, purchase-only, or PRIME). It would be nice to see how popular the covers are too as part of the search result.",amazon

7/15/2016,"I'm finding to much music requires ""purchases"", I thought with Amazon Prime music, like almost anything was free to play, but it's not. Some examples are: Metallica, Shinedown, Bob Segar...these all only play ""copyright"" samples, unless you go purchase the song. Fortunately, for me I have quite an extensive music library, I'm able to upload songs to my cloud library, but that as well has a limit of 250 songs!!!??? But for the most part, I'll use it some, just to get my moneys worth, but there is a lot of room for improvement, and this should all be transparently explained up front.

 AMAZON ROCKS",amazon
2/22/2014,"There is no music history, or way to customize the existing radio stations other than rating the song currently playing. I accidentally thumbed down a song I really liked, and now will never hear it again since there's no way to undo this action. Good design based on HCI principles should not allow for permanent consequences from simple user error. It's also not well documented whether rating a song affects all stations, or only the current station - for instance, I may not want to hear Philadelphia on my Classic Rock station between The Who and Hendrix, but I may have a Rock Ballads station that it would be perfectly acceptable on. Rating the song on one station shouldn't affect the other. If this behavior was better documented, and a simple rating history feature was implemented, Prime Music could replace my Pandora One subscription since I'm already an Amazon Prime member. #AnthonyNaddeo - get busy and fix this for me.",amazon

10/15/2015,"This app is by far the biggest piece of junk and it keeps getting worse. It CONSTANTLY syncs the cloud library which seems to slow down the device way too often. Buying individual songs vs buying whole albums causes issues when adding the music to your device, the streaming is really a jokaye and always cuts out if a stiff breeze comes along. All in all this app is a waste of time unless you download the music to a personal library and play it from an app made by people who know what their doing. I bought 4 songs off an album, for some reason it didn't add them to my phone. I tried then buying the full album to see if that would work and it downloaded all the songs but the first 4 I bought. I go to the amazon website to see if I can download the songs to my computer and then transfer them, nope, apparently there is a problem with my download and all I am able to do is submit a ticket. Seriously amazon, I expect more.",amazon

12/29/2015,"App doesn't work on my Android (Samsung Note). It had worked fine for quite some time and then one day stopped working properly. I went through Amazon ""tech support,"" which was a jokaye. The tech told me the problem was that I didn't have the latest version. It was a real hassle to download the latest version because I first had to download some Amazon App which is equivalent to a play store. The tech informed me that if I downloaded it elsewhere (like from other play stores or even the Amazon site) it wouldn't be the latest version. In the end it still didn't work, so the tech did some more checking and then told me they were having issues with Samsung devices but were working on it. Very frustrating and a big waste of time. Amazon Music works fine on my iPhone and, of course, through my Fire TV, but the music is very limited if you're not into pop stuff. This made the whole experience even worse because it wasn't worth my time. Amazon really needs to get it together if they expect to compete with Pandora and Spotify. .",amazon

7/18/2016,not sure about all the things it has to offer and what price i am paying,amazon

1/19/2016,Really like the variety,amazon
9/8/2016,So far I will give it 3 stars and see if it progresses into a real listenable station that can be used like Pandora or if everything I listen too must be purchased until the verdict is still out,amazon

11/27/2014,"Ease, great choices,",amazon
9/21/2016,I gave it 5 stars because prior to this I could not listen to my ITunes library on my android tablet. After uploading I now have access to my entire library with the added bonus of Prime Music.,amazon
6/19/2014,"So - last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. (Seriously? Google?) (I expect it from Microsoft - every MS Windows-based music player I have ever touched has been below lame.) I didn't care for Pandora - I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.
 
 So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say ""Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it's MP3 then store it all here!!"" SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.
 
 I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that won't ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes - and on an old iPod Photo 60G. (The 4g iPod still lives - but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom.) So over the next few weekends I open the laptop, start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. (A Samsung Charge on Verizon - a nice phone - good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill - ""City ID"" is one that is $2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!)
 
 After a month I was all done.
 
 Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs (250 - how laughable! NOT!) ... unless I pay $24.95 a year?
 
 Even though the price is reasonable - I still feel like - for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year, 5Gigs is free - I used my allotment and no more. When they said ""It's free!"" I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.
 
 Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization -- so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers - where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind - to the tune of $25 bucks a year just months later?
 
 And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. (I only traveled 25K miles last month, go figure!!) Now I have to re-rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I've got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic-appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.
 
 I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out - M-A-D-MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.
 
 If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive - where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT - I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot ""download"" an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap - promise. I am just that mad.
 
 Two other complaints: I use a netbookay most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The ""Artist"" column can not be expanded for example. You can't sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: ""display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues"" -- but yea, now my playlists are gone unless I fork over $24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn-tooting be nicely functional okay?
 
 Last - the Droid App tookay over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still -- to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a ""you must agree to this"" message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean, I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen tookay over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen tookay over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen tookay over. At that point in time I deleted this app, the Amazon Marketplace app, the Amazon Price Checker app, the Amazon Student app, The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.
 
 Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.
 
 Thank you for listening. I am sorry for this rant. I promise to be my normal, happy, down-to-earth self... next year sometime!!!
 
 Yes. I am just that mad.",amazon

7/29/2016,"Awesome to get music from, great quality. But, when streaming (at least in Bangor, Maine) it chops out a lot more than I like from my ""Cloud"". Unusual as I use iHeart Radio, .977 and TuneIn Radio and stream with no problem. Lookay into that if you would AMazon. I will say that with downloaded content the quality is high. Thanks. B",amazon

1/19/2016,"Great feature if you have amazon prime. I'm listening to stuff I want to listen to. I read a review that said that all the ""good stuff"" you have to buy. I lookay at it like this. If you like an artist and there is one of their albums that you don't have then listen to it for free. If there is an album of theirs that you want to buy then buy it you are still supporting your favorite band or artist. Not everything can be for free.",amazon

11/5/2014,Awesome. Fast Shipping,amazon
8/23/2016,"Amazon, you can do better. I like my album art. I want to see it while listening, not a dull gray UI. The app title and controls take away too much screen real estate. Even the store sucks and uses too much real estate for the app. Take a lesson from Google's music player.

6/18/2014,"It's great to have this player to access the music in your cloud. I use it a lot on long road trips. One huge complaint, however, is when I download music to my phone's SD card or create a playlist on my phone (as opposed to in my cloud). My music and playlists keep disappearing from my memory card!!! Very frustrating.",amazon
4/24/2012,I have triple checked the compatibility but it errors out when I try to install. I had to write this review on a PC as it won't even allow me to review the app on my device until I have successfully installed it. So there's probably a whole lot of people out there in the same boat who can't review because they can't install.,amazon
4/5/2017,"In order to work it forcing me to change language on my device (!).
 I think if device language is not supported by app, app should gracefully degrade to most popular languages - English or Chinese.",amazon

11/22/2014,"At best.
 
 It's not sufficiently intuitive. It assumes your only source of music will be purchases made from Amazon. It lacks features. It drains the battery and send to be a memory hog.

1/31/2016,listen to it while workout!,amazon
7/24/2016,"This app has a LONG way to go. But it's all you can use with Prime music. Searching for music comes up with lame knock-off remixes, and bands instead of the original artists. That is SO LAME. Also, there is NO EASY WAY to setup preferences to NEVER EVER find and/or playback explicit lyrics! Completely hazardous to family values. I would say that most people do NOT want to hear music that sings F_CK and B_ITCHES and MOTHERF_CKER all the time. Do NOT listen to ""RnB"" music on Amazon unless you like hearing the F word 1000 times per work day.",amazon

 Just figured out how to download songs from my playlist to my cell phone to play offline. This will come in handy to play in the car, since my radio is on the fritz. Must have tunes when driving!

11/8/2015,"I was skeptical at first, but after a phone call to customer support they helped answer my questions.
 #1 I thought I made a mistake when I downloaded my first 10 albums to my phone thinking I had spent 150 accidentally on music... This is what I learned.
 Prime is nice because any prime song can be put on the cloud or saved to your device for free. I was after an option that would not take up all my phones memory, but still allow me to have music on the go with or without Internet access.
 The songs with price tags are not free. The songs with the prime symbol are. So not every song you desire will be free but a good majority of my selection was. I have 178 songs so far and only spent about 5 dollars purchasing some songs that weren't prime approved.
 In response to my #1 experience I ended up paying .99 for the one song that was not prime out of the albums.",amazon

6/28/2014,The sound quality is good but the graphic needs improvement In order to compete with Pandora or Spotify. I would rate higher if graphic was a little better.,amazon
5/11/2014,So happy I moved into the 21st century and tried Prime Music!!,amazon
9/8/2015,"Ive been useing Amazon MP3 for years and have used it as my primary music player for four diffent phones ive used since the iPhone 3. The iPhone 3s 64gig is where I downloaded it first. Loved it on the HTC Sence and kinda miss it. Then I upgraded to a Galaxy Note 3 which was also wonderful and easily integrated with the device.
 
 I now use a LG smartphone. Interestingly when I set up my new phone I logged into my google account and my ohine automatically downloaded all the apps I had previously installed... except Amazon MP3. It was just gone.
 
 Today I went to install the new Music app and stopped short at the privacy screen. Good g-d!
 
 I went back and read some reviews and it lookays like I am not alone as far as being disappointed.
 
 DRM free music and general un censored control of my music is what wone me over back in 2007/2008
 
 Removing the option to save music and cover art to my external sd card is a huge deal. I want control.
 
 I accidentally figured out how to install the darn app only after accidentally figuring out how to install the prime video player extension to the Amazon app.
 
 It too damn hard to find for me and im somewhat savvy. Someone over there (maybe even sevral) needs to get there head out of there own doggy dish and render this app useable again.
 
 Relax the permissions and security it's just too much. I had to override my phones security to allow untrusted apps to have near full control of all my data. I call bulshit.
 
 Pandora had become redundant and boring. Sootify crashes my browser and is unreliable iheart radio and last fm were also not good enough for me to change my routine. And now Amazon MP3 has gone all prism on me... sad.
 
 After 5 blissful years I want a divorce. Unfortunately for you I'm keeping the kids and their allowance. The whole family is now addicted to Google Play Music where we can search nearly artist song or radio stream and be listening in seconds. Its also much easier to purchase music and movies via the play store as well.
 
 Sometimes Amazon just needs get out of their own way, and take my money.",amazon

8/7/2014,Amazon Prime has most of my favorite songs.,amazon
8/31/2015,"Do you have a phone on which you listen to music? Do you buy music from Amazon? Then you need to get this. It's a well designed program for getting your Amazon Music purchases to your phone. And the player is...acceptable. It plays music, and doesn't glitch up trying to do it.
 
 However, the more you use the player, the more you'll find it's not all you want. You'll listen to an album, and then it'll just stop; it won't keep playing to the next album in your library. The interface is straight forward, but just slightly off somehow. You'll want to do one thing, and you'll accidentally do another. You'll never have a MAJOR problem with the media player, but it's not the perfect answer.
 
 If you want something with tons of options and personalization, lookay elsewhere for your music app. If you're lookaying for a way to get your Amazon purchases to your phone, and a perfectly acceptable player for those songs, stop right here.",amazon

Amazon playlists are just as easy to access, navigate and choose by genre and mood. Even better, if I like a song on one of Amazon's playlists, I can add it to my personal playlist with just a couple of touches. I've found Amazon Music for Android even easier to use than the version for PC. Good job, Amazon.",amazon

I do not use its player or any of the other features. I dont like that it wants me to subscribe to prime, but at least it only asks once.

11/15/2015,"Have used my prime membership to download on my kindle for 2 years with no problem. But this app will not honor my prime membership nor will it access my cloud library without a paid membership. Imrove it and I'll improve my review. Otherwise, it's off my phone as wasted space.",amazon
11/12/2016,"I would recommend this app for easy access to all the music stored on my phone, PC, and iPad . I was
 Lookaying for simplicity and this is it. Thanks from a senior citizen.",amazon
8/15/2013,"The app insists on keeping any downloaded files on internal memory and not on the SD card. There's no configuration option for changing the library location.
 
 While the application has settings that claim to limit downloads to Wi-Fi only, and to not automatically download new purchases, my experience has been that the application does NOT respect these settings. I learned this when I found my phone downloading a Handel box set I'd purchased, eating up the remaining internal memory on my phone and using my T-Mobile data plan to do it. If I wasn't paying for unlimited data this bug would have cost me a few hundred megs in overage charges. I tried pausing the active download, but the application kept chugging along, giving me no way to STOP the downloads.
 
 The application can't be trusted to do what you tell it to do. A search through the support site reveals Amazon has no apparent plans to fix these problems. If you install it, be sure to have an unlimited data plan, or you WILL eventually get hit with a large data overage charge from your mobile carrier.
 
 I'm going to try and find a resolution for these bugs, but if I can't find one I'm uninstalling the application.",amazon

I can't see what's new and listen to previews of new music before purchasing, because nothing from this side of the globe is even on there!
 This needs to be fixed. No wonder so many people get their music for free via Torrents, when our choices to PURCHASE and control our own music libraries are piss poor. Greed in the streaming only game is pathetic, and you can only push people so far.

 I like the interface, but when I go to search for an artist (even with a name like Todd Rundgren) the search takes several minutes. I assumed this was due to the amount of songs I have uploaded, but the same search on the Amazon Echo app takes a second or two. My response time on my iPad is even worse, but the Echo app for iPad is instant.
 
 Not sure what the issue is, but if Amazon were able to make searches go quicker, this would be a five star rating. When people ask how satisfied I am with streaming through Amazon, I feel obligated to mention the painfully slow search time.",amazon

The only way I have found to use this is to download it to my computer first and then copy and paste the songs/albums to my Android device!! Really?? In this day and age??

1/8/2014,"The layout is not user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion.
 This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles.
 Fine, but I feel like I've lost a useful app in the revision.
 
 In the previous app version: it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising (listening whilst in motion).
 You now have to stop, go to additional screens (with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards!), & take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions (get playlist on device, shuffle, repeat song, etc.).
 Unacceptable from both a safety (car) &/or usability standpoint (exercise).
 
 When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile (eg: hear a song in a store that you like)- it STILL loads it to the internal memory. (!!!)
 My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.
 
 Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.
 Great if you're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.
 
 The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.
 (This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is).
 
 Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.
 OH....SOoooo not happy about that.
 I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I (now know that I) should have backed them up.
 I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists (not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc.).
 Am not happy about this.
 
 I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.
 (I don't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi).
 When I'm on a road trip- it's my bandwidth that's used if so.
 I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I don't need to use bandwidth to listen.
 Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.
 If I'm at home, fine.
  But it simply doesn't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.
 What do I gain here by using this app?
 Whatever I do gain- it's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.
 Amazon's late to the game on this.
 
 Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I won't be using their app (won't be running across products to buy).",amazon

8/27/2014,"HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings, deselect auto download, select it again, and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself doesn't indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that's too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows. I absolutely HATE it, & it makes me HATE Amazon.",amazon

4/15/2013,"Prime music impressed a friend and myself while listening to one of the playlists. We were both pleasantly surprised to hear many ""album cuts"" of songs that did not make Top 40 radio. The song repeat rate is much lower than a competing service I had subscribed to. It's easy to create custom playlists and add music to your library. I was skeptical of the Prime Music offering when Amazon introduced it but have come to realize it is not just a side venture; rather it is a extensive offering of music and artists.",amazon

10/13/2011,"Loved it at first. It was pre-installed bloatware on my Note 5 but since I was a Prime member I started using it. Lots of great music, easy to build play lists. Trouble is that the app got to a point where it needed an update but every time I attempt to update it failed. This is true of the Kindle app as well. Per some Amazon and Android forums I cleared my app cache, no change, Uninstalled and attempted to reinstall. Now the app cannot install at all. I hit generic Android errors and there are no good fixes that I have found on any Android or Amazon search. Downloading from Google Play or Amazon App Store makes no difference. That said, it may not be fair to rate the App so low when it's possibly an OS issue but other downloaded apps are behaving normally.",amazon

But then it started to say that it couldn't play music on my device. So I investigated, and Amazon changed the game. Now you have to pay $24.99 a year for their service. Don't get me wrong, if you want a cloud service, that's a decent deal. I just wanted a good music player on my phone for music that is already on my phone. That's all. For giving me a nice player, they got my business when I needed to purchase a song. But that is gone, and I switched to Google Play Music. It will do. I don't like it as much yet, but I haven't used it long. And now they will make the money when I decide to buy a song. I completely deleted the Amazon app from my phone.",amazon

I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is okay but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service.

 I do think the background should be black since that seems to take less battery, plus the contrast of white on black is easier to see than vice versa.
 
 I think the Cloud import function should give the option to convert files that aren't mp3 to mp3. Its not necessary but if it did do that I wouldn't need to open iTunes for much of anything.

7/3/2012,I bought this in 2011 for my 13 year old son and he just loves it!!! We have had no problems.,amazon
9/9/2012,"Great idea. The set up and use of amazon's ""cloud"" was really easy. A little reading/research, a few clicks, and good to go.
 The MP3 ""downloader"" was even easier...
 
 Now I have access to my music collection from any internet link. I don't have to worry about transporting my CD's, or getting them scratched, stolen, or otherwise damaged/lost.
 
 I can download or stream over my laptop, smartphone, and still transfer to my MP3. My music collection is very easy to deal with now, and I have more options than ever. No more lost, stolen, or scratched CD's!! (YAY!!!) =)",amazon

 Not only can I not use it. I also don't have access to my paid library of music because I the old app that DID work is no longer available from what I've found. Thus Amazon owe me a couple hundred dollars in music. They should have left the old MP3 app available til they worked the bugs out. But like most large entities this days it's about the bottom line not the consumers needs.",amazon
10/25/2016,Why did the daily free song disappear??? It use to be there. There is no reason to use this app then. 1 star.,amazon
10/9/2011,"No trace of this app on my kindle, tech support says to be patient - why should I be patient? If something isn't ready, don't put it on your website or store shelves. Bought a kindle fire just to use this app but it doesn't exist.",amazon

4/16/2014,"Oh, man...I was really hoping this would allow me to get rid of Spotify Premium and save some $$ each month. False. This app has one of the least user-friendly interfaces I've ever experienced.

3/3/2015,Keeps on giving me an authentication error exception #117,amazon
12/25/2016,"The last update makes this app an all in one player. Please add additional widgets, 4x2 would be perfect. Keep it up.",amazon
4/26/2011,The importing process from iTunes was no easy task and as I use it with my Samsung network speakers (purchased through Amazon) it is not smooth. I know it is Amazon music because the stream from network works fine while the stream from Amazon jumps and cuts off songs. For the price and nearly unlimited number of songs it gets 3 stars.,amazon
5/15/2015,"This is app is a must if you have invested in Amazon Prime and want to make the most of the music resources available. Works equally well on my Kindle, Nexus 7 tablet and Android phone (Galaxy S 5). Having access to a relatively rich and varied library gives the user more personal control than streaming services. The pre-selected playlists are entertaining and the ability to create your own playlists is good. I primarily take advantage of the music that is freely accessible through my Prime account. I have not purchased any songs or albums. The app, itself, is clean, straightforward and easy to use.",amazon

10/11/2017,"Plenty of storage available for free. I use it mostly for sharing access to my mp3s between multiple devices. Not sure how well the streaming works or how much bandwidth it consumes, but the are nice options to allow you to limit downloads while using cellular networks, which may keep you from getting an unpleasant data charge from your provider.",amazon
6/18/2011,"Came to Amazon to download a single mp3 legally. Didn't get the song version right, cause the sample was too short to tell. Also I had to download an app to be able to listen and download song. Ridiculous! Already uninstalled!",amazon
6/7/2016,"Where's the metal? It's all mainstream. I am constantly let down by Pandora and other so called music apps. I am a metal head who can truly recognize talent in any music I hear. This app is nothing but an extension of the over pampered, over rated, computer synthesized, failure of music today. This is why I enjoy metal. It's one of the few mediums left today that still has true heart. Sadly, even many of the hearts of this genera is selling out faster than American Idol can ruin the youth who watch and silently dream of this pop music crap.",amazon
2/25/2015,"It's almost fabulous. I don't have an iPhone so I can't get my iTunes unless I'm at home. This app allow me to listen to my Amazon library while I'm out and about. My one star less is because there's no way (that I've found) to set music to a timer. I like to fall asleep to subliminal and binaural beat tracks sometimes, but I'll wake up hours later and have to turn it off because it just keeps playing. Otherwise, I'm enjoying my tunes :-)",amazon
10/15/2014,"I'm an old-timer - 47 years old. I grew up buying records and still like to hold something physical in my hands, so, I'm still buying CD's. They all get ripped and it's still incredible to me that these days we can walk around with thousands of songs in our pockets. When Amazon let me know that they now have all my CD purchases already ripped for me, well, that really is icing on the cake! Sound quality is fantastic and I'm enjoying this new feature immensely! Thanks, Amazon!",amazon
2/14/2013,"Nice to be able to stream 250 of my mp3s. I would probably go for the expanded service if I had a ton more music I wanted to access remotely always, or if it was a bit cheaper.",amazon
9/29/2017,Excellent music app for prime members. Loads of free playlists and stations that you can stream on your phone or tablet. The app lets you add songs to playlists and your library.,amazon
7/30/2016,"To be honest i downloaded this app in hopes of getting free mp3`s after it was suggested from Shazam another music locater app. But sincei noticed that i would have to pay for sounds that i know i can get free even if there is a virus risk, i closed it and never bothered to open it or uninstall it. In search of a mobile app that i wouldnt have to pay for music, if there is anyone with info to provide me with please feel free.
 
 Unfair- it may be unfair that i rated it with only two stars but as i was disappointed the ratings showed.",amazon
2/18/2014,"App installation and buying experience is okay.
 
 What is infuriating is that the app closes randomly. You put the android in your pocket, it closes. Put your phone on your desk, closes. Music stops, and you have to restart the app completely. App takes 15 seconds to load, even on my Samsung Galaxy S 9000. Song has to be restarted from beginning (interruption point was not saved)
 
 All this on our 2 phones (different models) so hardware problems are to be excluded.
 
 Really disappointed.",amazon
8/24/2011,All of a sudden I have used almost 4GB of data. I made sure the app was set to download via Wi-Fi only and the next day another 2.5GB was downloaded. And the battery drain on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was amazingly slow...until I installed Amazon music and then half of it was gone in half a day with very little use. It appears it automatically syncs with the cloud every 10 minutes without any option for adjustment. Why would I need to sync every 10 minutes? Very disappointing. Uninstalled it from ALL our phones. Please fix these issues!,amazon
6/23/2014,offline has many Glitches. offline should not require Loading that's the whole point of Offline so I find it reacting like its buffering. needs offline quality setting added,amazon
10/21/2015,"Since the update of Amazon mp3 player, many of the songs I purchased thru Amazon, and downloaded thru Amazon, will not play. I get ""exception 119"" or other playback errors. This is annoying in and of itself, but when using the player during a run or workout, it completely stops the player, meaning I have to finish the run/workout without music, or break my pace/concentration to skip to the next song.
 
 Getting a paltry number of ""free"" (for prime) songs to choose from doesn't override the inconvenience of a player that doesn't play.....",amazon
6/15/2014,"I think it's great although I would like to be able to download music to my PC or iMac rather than just my mobile telephone. Since it's bundled with Prime Instant Video, I'm not getting my money's worth and should only have to pay a portion of the $99.00 that I'm being charged. When I want to buy something, I'm told that I have to use a local credit card which charges me an exchange fee (I live abroad). However, when I signed up, Amazon gladly accepted my U.S. credit card. Don't you think that's a bit hypocritical?",amazon
10/21/2014,"Great extra with the prime membership. I would give it five stars but it lacks the content that a beats music or spotify have. I would gladly pay a little extra on my prime membership to have access to the amount of content I now get with beats music. It would make my life easier not to have an additional music service that I have to pay for monthly. I already pay for netflix, hulu plus, beats music and wwe network monthly, to get rid of beats and replace it with a vamped up prime music service would be ideal.",amazon
10/31/2014,"It froze up frequently requiring me to pull the battery to reboot my phone, a brand new Samsung S5. I never could get it to recognize my amazon account, so I couldn't stream prime music or even retrieve albums I've purchased. It was a huge resource and battery hog too. After trying a second install and an update I gave up and deleted it. Canceled my prime membership too.",amazon
1/10/2015,I like the cost versus some other guys. There are some tracks that I cannot find though. But the price makes it all better.,amazon
10/21/2017,"I suppose it may be okay, but since I am an ""Invited Guest"" of a Prime member (my wife), I can't use it on my smartphone or Kindle Fire (my wife has neither so there's zero chance of having more than one device using it at a time). I checked with Amazon and that's just the way it is. Tough luck, I guess. I'll continue using my subscriptions to Spotify and Panora.",amazon
6/16/2014,"I have turned my back on iTunes. This is my music library now. I have this app on my phone and I can download whatever songs I want from my Amazon library. I can download music I've purchased from Amazon or songs I've uploaded (like the songs I imported from my old iTunes. Once the song is on my phone, I can listen even if I'm not in a WiFi area, and it doesn't need my data minutes either.

2/1/2017,"Never installed....and the new version of amazon and Amazon video sucks. I am bot planning on renewing my yearly subscription. I believe that Amazon is doing this intentionally to discourage people and fix their money issue they saythat Amazon prime has caused them.

8/28/2017,"I have listened to a lot of the Prime Music that I had lost track of through the years. It is hard to keep up with the format changes, records, tapes, 8-tracks,and CD's. For instance....I hadn't listened to Joni Mitchell in years and found her music as delightful as I did in the 60's. I have a bluetooth speaker to use with my Android, and a computer connected to my A-V system and it has been wonderful to have access to so much music in an instant.",amazon
3/19/2015,The app is more frustration than enjoyment on my Android phone. I have given up on it working and have uninstalled it.,amazon
8/2/2014,"I got all excited for nothing when they announced prime music streaming... the songs won't download to my device! And there is no way to determine where to download it to (device vs sd card). How annoying! Not sure why Amazon would announce something that doesn't work and doesn't seem to have a help section to tell you how to make it work?! You're better than this Amazon, I paid almost $100 for my Prime membership so I believe in you Amazon!!!",amazon
6/23/2014,"I'm excited to see where Amazon will go with this new feature. It's early so naturally there will be some quirks. Initially I found it a bit difficult to navigate and find music in my library. I'm curious if I cancel my subscription to Prime if I no longer have access to the music I loaded onto my device. For now I'll go with 3 stars but hope as the program develops it will improve. It's Amazon, I'm sure it will be a great product in no time.",amazon
6/16/2014,"Amazon MP3 was preinstalled on my Android device, and I initially uninstalled it because I don't like ""Bloatware"". However, I got an email from Amazon that said my former CD purchases were available through the Cloud Player and that made me change my decision to reinstall the app. I enjoy the fact that most CD's are automatically 'ripped' to the Cloud once purchased, making my music available anywhere. Great product for FREE.",amazon
2/23/2013,"Nice to have some free download options as a benefit for having prime; however, it would also be nice to be able to listen to those free songs through another music app i.e. poweramp. I understand why, but what good is having cake if you can't eat it, too?
 That being said, I think all other aspects of this app, based on my brief experience thus far, are wonderful and the average user/listener would really enjoy what it has to offer.",amazon
9/21/2014,Lowest ratings possible; because it does not work in my country of Trinidad and Tobago,amazon
6/21/2017,"Nice idea but still room for improvement. Android app user interface isn't as intuitive as it should be, and capabilities in general seem limited. For instance, the ability to shuffle across a collection of albums or a user-defined playlist doesn't exist or has eluded my search so far.
 
 That said, the audio quality seems fine and it's a nice added benefit that halps make up for increasing the cost of a Prime membership.",amazon

7/18/2015,"I have downloaded the app and on my Samsung Galaxy S I find I am connected to Amazon MP3 UK. UK? I live in the US. I can't find any online help with this and the best I got from Amazon is that they don't know what is going on and I should call them to resolve the issue. I don't want to call them, I want an app that works correctly.
 
 Great idea but the app isn't ready for prime time.",amazon
4/26/2011,"I was so excited about this app until I actually tried to use it much. First off, the music I download disappears all the time and I have to redownload, which is a pain in the butt.
 
 Secondly, the music stutters when I try to play it via the headphone jack, which means it's practically useless to me since I primarily use it to listen to music in the car.
 
 Back to Google play music I go. =/",amazon
1/19/2016,"While it's pretty spare in the features area, it is a quick and easy way to access my music collection in the Amazon cloud. I can easily download the content to my player (a Samsung Galaxy S phone that has been re-purposed into a media server) or stream it without difficulty. I would especially like more sorting and indexing options (it's very literal on the artist name - I would like to be able to do wildcard searches).",amazon

6/22/2017,Amazing selection. Thanks Amazon Prime for ALL the goodies you offer members.,amazon
10/22/2014,"So what exactly does having a prime membership get you in this app?

I just wish the app didn't take up so much of my memory.",amazon
3/20/2015,"I listen to all my friends with Iphones complain about the trouble of moving music and such. I can't sympathize with them. The ease of Amazon MP3 is great. I even uploaded my music to my cloud. I can listen to it anywhere.

2/10/2013,There's some decent music on it but the variety is limited.,amazon

Or better yet: Just fix it.",amazon
10/24/2014,"Finally! This is great so far, I used the Amazon MP3 for all my music, so the transition wasn't bad for me.

6/17/2014,"Works well with a few exceptions. Wish there was a way to delete downloaded items just off my device when I need to free up storage, there's always a little freeze in the playback when I'm streaming over Bluetooth and I lock my phone, and on android can be way too complicated to kill the app. Other than that I'm really satisfied",amazon

 Useless. Any attempt to open the settings menu or play music causes a Force Close. Test this code on Google flagship phones before you release it, ya big dorks.

2/18/2013,very gooood! thank you Amazon music,amazon
1/1/2017,"Not bad, but too commercial - oriented toward selling tracks & albums. Just no way I'm gonna pay a buck or so for digital music downloads. Also not user-friendly for me. I give three stars rather than two because it's free (for Prime members).
 Going back to Rhapsody.",amazon
10/28/2014,"This is honestly the best app ever. I uploaded all of my CDs to the cloud, and I use it to listen to my music on my computer in my office. I can also plug my phone into my cars stereo and it works great even over 3g.",amazon

2/25/2013,Until i can find a way to hear more than 30 second snip's of songs on my phone this app gets 2 stars...from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime. I dropped my Pandora and will drop Goggle music once I figure out how to hear more of a song.,amazon

6/26/2017,this music system is way awesome. it makes finding music and listening way more pleasurable and easy to find and access .,amazon
6/18/2014,"I've noticed a lot of negativity due to lack of sd storage. Yes, you can't natively download to an sd card, however your phone should have a file manager where you can export to an sd card. If you've ever used a pc or mac this should be a simple concept. It's just like moving files from one folder to another. Your music player apps will read mp3 files from anywhere on your phone. It would be nice to have the option in the settings in order to eliminate a step, but sometimes we need to do things on our own and use a little thinking to get there.",amazon
6/17/2014,"Contrary to what other users have posted, I find the app fairly user friendly and intuitive.",amazon

8/13/2014,"I got the app in December and got all my music organized, stored all on an SD card and playlists set up (which you can do only one song at a time), then shortly after it stopped reading most of the songs on the SD card. I had to redownload and resort the ""lost"" songs. Now it's done it again. It started by no longer reading the artist and album info, just the song title. Then it stopped reading the files altogether. Other music apps read and played the files fine. I see the song files on the card but the app won't play them. This time, my cloud too has only an odd assortment of purchased and already owned songs so i can't even redownload and there's no option to get the app to re-scan what's on the SD card, where the app itself put the files. Make sense?",amazon
2/7/2016,You guys are listening. However maybe I missed it but can you back up your playlists that are created on an android device? If that is not already done that should be next.,amazon
10/28/2014,The previous version of the app was much more stable. Ever since they revamped the interface and launched the Unlimited service I have had problems with the streaming part of the app. It pauses after a few songs (even on my wifi) if it doesn't outright crash. Running it on Android 7 on a Nexus 6P.,amazon
10/28/2016,"These are the cutest sandals I have seen and I had tried to order them last year but they were out-of-stock. So I reordered this year. They still are the cutest sandals and go with anything. Unfortunately, I have a high instep and with the strap being so far up my foot, I could not wear them.
 Rather than return them, I plan to pass them on to my cousin. Therefore the I rated them as a 4 for me when they are really a 5 star. The size was exact and shipping was swift with arrival on time. I'm just so disappointed that I can't wear these sandals.",amazon

8/10/2015,"I could not find an easy way to play or shuffle and entire playlist or the entire library.

4/2/2011,at the end of every song it stops playing and says network lost even on wifi. super annoying and I stream Netflix over 3g with out a single stop so this is just unacceptable.,amazon
5/18/2011,"Like so many others have said, streaming from the cloud is just amazing. Being able to free up my SD card was great. The cloud is def the way to go. Interface is simple -too simple. Plus the music prices are simply FANTASTIC.
 
 Edit: I mistakenly selected 1 star. 5 stars is what I meant.",amazon
11/12/2011,"Just received it yesterday and very disappointed. The case requires you to unscrew 6 small screws in the front to use insert your phone. It's not a standards size screw you would typically have a screwdriver for around the house. Hence, it will require you to purchase a screwdriver somewhere just to use the product. It also has no instructions and is a little heavier then expected.",amazon
12/5/2015,"The interface is terribly confusing and incredibly difficult to navigate. It's hard to figure out how to even get to your music. It's a resource hog. You can't control whether it downloads to your internal memory or SD card. If a download of purchased tracks fails (which it usually does) the ""Download Failed"" message can't be dismissed from your notifications regardless of whether or not the app is running (since some process of it is ALWAYS running). You have to reboot the phone in order to clear any stray items it leaves in your notifications.
 
 Just give us something that lets us download the tracks we purchased so we can use whatever player we want.",amazon

 UPDATE
 6/20/2014 - When I first posted this, it was not available on the first generation Kindle Fire, however the I.T. people got right on it and now us original owners have the benefit of Prime Music. Thanks Amazon!",amazon

7/3/2014,"I'm a big Again fan in general. We have a kindle, three kindle fires and three Android phones in the family that heavily utilize Amazon apps. We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.
 
 The Amazon mp3 app itself was okay, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked okay, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well.",amazon

3/22/2015,"I have been using the Amazon Music App on my Tablet pretty much since it became available. I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet. This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App, this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.
 
 However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had (meaning songs I didn't download from Amazon). I have my entire library on random so after the 20th track of very old music, I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists. I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device (why wouldn't they be?), yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I'm offline. Even albums I've purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app. I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members, (System of a Down, 311, Disturbed, etc), yet for some reason the app doesn't want to play them anymore unless I'm connected to the internet.
 
 If I connect to the internet, then viola!! all my downloaded content plays. But think about this for a moment, what is the purpose of downloading for ""offline play"" if I can only play them when I'm online? I don't know what changed but an app that worked so well is now brokayen and pretty much useless for what I use it for. I'm not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the 8 - 10 hours I'm at work just because Amazon decided to break something.
 
 This is incredibly ridiculous, and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull, and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library doesn't work. My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again, but I might not even bother because in 6 months it will probably break again.",amazon

12/2/2016,"I only recently started using the Prime Music app, & after uploading my own music (matched by Amazon) & finding some Prime music that I was happy to find is available (free w/ Prime), am very happy with Amazon Music thus far. I briefly tried Google Music, & two popular music streaming apps (Pandora, & Songza), and my Amazon Music experience has been infinitely better. I had a few technical questions initially (re: uploading my music, using PC & iPhone, etc.) that weren't addressed online, & support for Amazon Music was available right away, very knowledgeable & spot on (I now realize) as far as recommendations made.
 Now that I'm routinely playing music & adding or deleting individual songs from my library, etc., my impression is that more thought and planning went into the design and functionality of Amazon Music than the other options I've explored. It's very intuitive; graphics are very professional & consistent; it's very responsive (I've not (yet, anyway) experienced any lag or technical glitches); there's no annoying behavior by the app to aggressively ""encourage"" you to buy music unless you've expressed that interest; and - one feature I really appreciate - no ads (pop-up or otherwise). Quality of stream is excellent.
 My impression is that Amazon (wisely) realizes that this app nicely integrates with their business model, & complements their core mission; that is, if the app works well & people have a very nice experience, it becomes a very ""sticky"" service (i.e., enhances loyalty & overall impressions of Amazon, & encourages more people to join (or continue their membership with) Prime). In any event, they've done a very nice job designing & implementing this service (& accompanying app), & I'm really enjoying it.",amazon
9/5/2015,"Pros:
 -okayay music selection. Had a fair amount of music that I enjoy (mostly have metal/death metal added, no other genre)
 -Free with Prime Subscription
 -Offline listening
 
 Cons:
 -If you want a lot more to choose from, you need an additional subscription
 -Having lyrics up causes memory issues (tons of lag) on my device after a short period of time
 
 Final thoughts: Extended music library shouldn't be something that costs extra. And if you insist on charging extra, mark down the price please. Overall, a nice app that does what it's supposed to.",amazon

 Drag to a list to download? I WANT IT ALL OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT!!!
 
 Amazon music is the worst program I have EVER run into, and I have been in computers since 1972. THE WORST I have ever run into!
 
 It appears that they want us to leave everything on the cloud, make play lists and stream it off the cloud. The problem with that is that mostly I send it to my tablets and my phone, which I then listen to in my car or out in public. The tablets only ever have an internet connection in my house. My phone has to pay BIG BUCKS for data to stream music I already own.
 
 Streaming may work just fine sitting at my desk in my home over a broadband, but it just doesn't work AT ALL out in the world. I need to download to my devices. ALL OF THEM! All my music.
 
 Let me repeat, AMAZON MUSIC is the WORST program I have EVER RUN INTO. And I have run into some reaaaaaalllly bad crap.
 
 Sadly, Amazon doesn't care, nor do they read these comments, so this is just an exercise in expressing my frustration.

1/5/2016,I've been using Amazon Music for quite a while now and I have to say that I have seen constant improvements with every update. This is a perk that is not to be treated as an extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it. One special note is that you are allowed up to 10 devices but if you call Amazon and explain that you no longer have some of those devices they are more than accommodating. The selection of music has become very impressive and adding music to your library is easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library. Amazon music works very well on all my devices and computers. It is truly a great value added service.,amazon

The attempted setup of a library for music required that I pay for another subscription. Definitely not worth another $99. Cannot say how the service works. Unhappy",amazon
6/16/2016,"Your app is very limited that sometimes it gets close to absurdity.
 
 1. I expended over a $100 in your store to get a 128GB memory card. I have not taken advantage of it because your app doesnt allow specifying in which folder I want the music to be downloaded. I have to maneuver and keep transferring the music manually which is really aggravating. At times, if I have no done a recent transfer to the memory card and I will not be at home in a while, Im in such need of memory that I have to clear the whole Amazon music from my phone. The start the whole process again.
 
 2. To free up memory from my device, I selected the voicemails messages to be downloaded to the memory card. Your app makes them part of the library. Worse than that, I cant delete them all at once or better, just delete them from the library but keep them stored in my phone. At times I had deleted over 20 voice mails one by one from the app library. That how stupid it becomes.
 
 3. Same as #2, I have downloaded complete playlists from Prime. I discover songs that I dont like and I dont know how to get rid of them while keeping the rest of the library intact.
 
 4. I can't play my music offline and wasting my cell phone data streaming. When I try to play music supposedly downloaded to my cellphone, I get an error message with a ""Exception #180"" code

Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. It's pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it's a serious space hog and there just isn't enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can't be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I'll be more than happy to use it.",amazon
5/20/2016,"This app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that's bc it does SO MUCH! I wanna address 2 complaints I read abt 'no external SD support.' & that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist & that made the app a piece of crap. okayay, so 1st off, 500 songs is like 3 Days worth of music. I have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music. Does anyone's phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight?? if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot & prbly melt the phne. So, to me that's a useless comment & irrelevant. The other issue: I like that all the music us stored in the Cloud & it doesn't use ANY Storage space on my device. If u own the music u can download to ur device (it's fast!) to play offline if u ever get stuck or just don't want to use data. And, YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDERS 2 an external SD card if u have an Android (Samsung S5 user here). it works just like moving files on a computer. The hitch is this: u can download aNY of the music u want. However, u can only move the music you own. Amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: MP3 & MP4. It downloads in MP3 if u own it. Then u can move to an SD card & the app will find it & play it. MP4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage. Hopefully, most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this, so you can't transfer & steal music u haven't purchased.

12/7/2013,"I've been a member of Prime for a really long time. And a user of the Music app since it first appeared. And maybe the problem is specific to the Fire HD 10? It seems to work fine on my desktop - but I'm not going to risk testing it either since I'm talking about thousands of songs which are only manageable with playlists.
 After a few weeks of listening to my music offline, which is a mix of purchased prime and my own collections of CD songs, the player starts skipping over certain/ random purchased Prime songs. Of course they are the ones I listen to the most. Flashbacks of digital rights usage? Clearing the cache does nothing, syncing does nothing. Support had me delete the data which fixes the playback but it also deletes the playlists. Playlists that constitutes hours if not days of music - gone - poof! The option to download the cloud playlist does not work past 1 to 3 songs. Transferring a large music library from my computer is best done directly on the SD card with a card reader as the USB cable option hangs up pretty quickly. Transfer of purchased music results in duplicates on the device. Oh sure, I remember which one is which since the last century. The Amazon Music player must keep the playlists internal to itself rather than isolated and safe? It would make so much more sense to have those playlists synchronisable wouldn't it?
 Reminds me of when ms quit selling music, their player crapped out and amz stepped in.",amazon
6/8/2016,"Either Amazon did not think to allow the transfer of downloaded prime music to an SD card, or it purposefully prevents such transfers. While the latter is more egregious, both are unforgivable. A few lines of simple coding (if that) would solve the problem but so far there is no indication that Amazon is working to do that. Are you? Hint to Amazon: ""free"" prime music is not free. Your prime customers are paying a hefty annual fee for the privilege. Second hint: even if the music is transferred to an SD card, which admittedly could allow easier movement to another device, Amazon still could code it to prevent access if the user is not signed into a valid prime account, so what does it matter? For your (tens of) thousands of customers who have limited data plans and devices with minimal internal memory, this is a huge problem. We are not always connected to wifi and therefore cannot always access your ""cloud"" to listen to our prime music.

10/21/2016,"I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs & limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.
 
 The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.
 
 It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.
 
 Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.
 
 Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...
 
 It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.
 
 I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.
 
 Thanks for reading my review.",amazon
6/14/2014,"The Amazon music app is okayay. I use it almost everyday. I'm content with the selection provided-occassionaly frustrated by an album I can't listen to.
 There have been a few errors with the program I've experienced. But, the most egregious is the load time for me to access my music. Somedays I'll hop in my car, excited to listen to some tunes. I click on the app. And I wait a moment. Then some more moments...and it's still loading.
 
 So, a little frustrated, I'll start driving. It couldn't take that long could it?
 
 Sometimes it'll come up after maybe 5 minutes or so. Other times- 15 minutes down the road- The screen still hasn't popped up.
 
 Usually. After reaching my destination, I'll close all screens on my phone log then reopen the program and everything is cool.
 I do not know about programing, though I know I have a higher end phone, so I can't say 100% who's at fault here- but from the lookays of it- others have the same problem with this app.
 
 Anyhow. I'll likely keep using it. I've been roped in with prime- this is basically free- only a few bucks a month- and I can listen to albums after whatever procedures I've come across.
 
 It's not convenient. I don't like it. But it'll do.",amazon
11/11/2017,"This app insists on putting all your music on the phone's internal storage. There is no way to move it to the SD card. Therefore, the amount of music you can have with you is bound by the unchangeable internal memory rather than an SD card which can be 32GB or larger.
 
 This problem has been known for YEARS. The developers have deliberately ignored it. They simply don't care about how useless this idiotic, pointless restriction makes the app.
 
 Amazon is pretty good at a lot of things, but when it comes to this app, it's amateur hour.",amazon
1/17/2014,It has some good music but the selection sucks. The songs I want are there . For a subscription service that is included with prime it should have a much larger database of music to choose from . I can download music to my phone or use Pandora with so much more ease and not get a headache,amazon
6/2/2017,"I've been buying music and streaming it via Cloud Player for a couple of years now. Now I finally decided to try to download all of it (so I can put it in the car), and wow, what a mistake.
 
 I have just 974 tracks totaling about 6GB. Using the Mac version of Amazon's MP3 downloader, I'm now starting the fourth attempt with no hope of success in sight. The first two attempts ended with the downloader simply crashing partway through. Absolutely pathetic that such a simple piece of software, which shouldn't even be necessary in the first place, wouldn't be able to do its job. It's not smart enough to simply pick up where it left off, either, so you need to delete everything before trying again otherwise you'll end up with multiple copies of any files unfortunate enough to be part of the first, failed download.
 
 On the third attempt it managed to download all 974 files without crashing. Celebrations were premature, however, as it turns out a random 50% of the files were stored with cut off names. For example, a file name that should have been ""01. Track Name.mp3"" would end up just being called ""01. Track N"", with half the name and the .mp3 extension just missing. Again, the only thing I can do is delete the entire 6GB download and start again, crossing my fingers really hard this time. Thank goodness I'm not paying for bandwidth.
 
 It's difficult to imagine that someone could have fouled up a piece of software so simple by accident. The only plausible explanation is that Amazon is deliberately shipping this brokayen program in the hopes of discouraging people from downloading the music they purchase, hoping they'll give up and resort to streaming it forever instead. Considering that the music is sold to us with the promise that it can be easily downloaded, this is nothing less than a blatant bait and switch scheme.",amazon
4/2/2014,"I like Amazons cloud and being able to upload (for free) your own music and download it on any device. While it wasnt my go to music app, because it was limited, it still did what it did very well.
 
 With the addition of free music for prime members how ever it feels that the weakness of the app's design has appeared. Prime members get a mix of; bad, okay, excellent choices of free music to choose from. Im a progressive house/trance fan so my selection is super limited. Im not one for modern day pop music.
 
 I know millions of people are okayay hearing a song for the 30th time on the radio and for some reason add it to their playlist for more future listening. But I dont like that type of music. So I must depend on browsing for music. Prime music makes it really hard because the music I KNOW I want to hear isnt free so I wish Prime can introduce me to music I may want to hear that is available to prime members. Currently the only way to introduce listeners to new music is by listening to other peoples play list. Which so far I have found nothing I fully enjoy. And it seems you cant manipulate the playlist that easily. The user interface makes it difficult to add/delete music. Is the music I downloaded on my phone via a playlist totally tied to just that playlist or is it in my music library?
 
 *In addition I found that even searching for music even with knowing an artist makes finding prime music a pain. While typing in an artist on my PC (which by the way you can only sample songs when using amazon.com but you can search, meanwhile amazons music program lets you play a full song added to your library but you can search for songs outside of your library) I found that not all the songs for prime were listed when typing in the artists name. I had to type in the song individually to get that result.
 
 All in all it is a smooth start for Prime. Very little bugs.
 
 Pros:
 Not laggy and no bugs yet
 Free Music
 Great launch for Prime
 Pop music for the masses.
 
 Cons:
 Hodge podge of song selections makes finding music you want to listen to more annoying.
 Music discovery is dependent on other peoples playlist. No I dont want to listen to Nicky Romero, Pitbull, and Armin all at once. Please add an intelligent radio program so to help you find music that fits your taste
 UI is bit difficult and getting to the songs you want to listen to a bit tedious. Too much clicking
 add/delete songs from playlists is confusing",amazon
6/19/2014,"This app is an absolute mess. If and when it works properly, it will only work that way for a short period of time. For those who were familiar with Amazon's previous mp3 app (which worked great), this an ""upgraded"" version of that app that's just completely missed the mark.
 
 I will give the one positive of this app is that you can quickly move between device and cloud. So if you have created playlists or Amazon Prime playlists, you can easily get those. That's really where my enthusiasm for this app ends.
 
 My current issues with this app:
 
 - Freezing - This app freezes constantly. I listen to music each morning/afternoon as I ride the train to and from work. Each time I boot up the app, it will be at my last play point, freeze, give me the stopped working message, and then reboot again always at the Cloud/Albums page.
 
 - Unresponsive Controls - It happens fairly often where I will hit the skip button and nothing happens. It's actually more like I hit it 12 times before I give up. Finally when I accept that I can't skip a song the app catches up and quickly skips past 12 songs.
 
 - Unresponsive Quick Bar - When in the Songs screen, the quick bar that allows you to move between different letters will be touch and go if it works. And it never fails, it always stops working when I'm on a song with the letter A and decide a song with the letter T would be better.
 
 - Playlists that don't shuffle or shuffle when they feel like it.
 
 - Always have to choose repeat and shuffle. Sometimes, you just know the song you want to start with. Every time I hand pick a song I always have to re-choose repeat and shuffle, or it will just start going in order. The previous Amazon mp3 player always remembered my selection.
 
 I will admit most of my complaints are, when isolated, an annoyance. But those annoyances occur daily and add up fast. The only reason I continue to use this app is because I've invested a lot into Prime and Prime Music. I will admit, Amazon has me over a barrel on this one.
 
 If you don't have a huge investment in Prime Music and you're just lookaying for a music app, definitely lookay elsewhere.
 
 If improvements and fixes are made to the app, I will come back and update my review.",amazon
9/27/2014,"As a Prime member we always try and explore new music. Initially there was a bit of a curve to sort it all out. But as with all Amazon products, interact and select the suggestions as well as various a ratios station's and samples. Amazon-Amazing analytical tools as well as their buyers and Brand merchants will soon learn your likes and open new worlds.",amazon
8/8/2015,"Nice app. Easy to use, no ads. Good value if you are a prime member. Streaming, off line, individual songs, stations, thumbs up/thumbs down. It has per-existing play lists or you can create your own.
 Minuses? Not many. I wish it would remember the station I was listening to and return to it after I turn it off and then turn it back on again.
 
 Ali Julia review",amazon
7/30/2017,Someone told me if I had Amazon Prime I could stream music using my account...in the end the truth is I was assaulted by repeated offers to pay more money to join music unlimited and could not play anything that I had not already purchased. What a disappointment.,amazon
8/6/2017,"I only want certain songs downloaded to my kids' devices and I don't want them to be able to purchase music. With the previous version, I could log in on their device, download the song they wanted, and then log out. They could easily find and play their songs. After the most recent update, I can't figure out how to get to their songs without being logged in. When you open the app, it prompts you to log in before you can do anything. I tried just finding their music and playing it through android's music player, but amazon songs don't show up as music. I was able to dig around and find them, but it was a hassle. I can choose the amazon player to play each song individually, but the other functions don't seem to work. I have to go through the file system for each song. At least once I did that, my device recognized the files as music so I can use the android music player. UGH.",amazon
6/13/2014,"Same old music, just different station names. Since the new update, it no longer connects to my Ford Sync, just bluetooth audio. The push to get people to pay for this service leaves the music that is provided to Prime members very lacking. Don't try to force me me to pay more money, I promise you I won't pay, I'll just leave you, there are plenty of other services out there.",amazon
11/15/2016,Why did they break my Amazon Music app??? i had playlists set up and I didn't have to have an inet connection to listen...now they are gone and I'm not able to find any of my music playlists or music I had downloaded!! Dug out my old sandisk and using that again. Bad move Amazon! I won't use iTunes so now I'm in search of a different provider. great job - you just lost a customer.,amazon
7/1/2014,"This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I've got that done there's no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by (say) Artist I've got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.
 
 Searching isn't terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, ""m"" there's no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I'm moved to a different search tab. This isn't rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you're this app is doing isn't better.
 
 Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it's laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. There's a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I'm forced to use it when (say) interacting with my Echo.",amazon
9/27/2015,"Finally this lousy app allows you to download the music YOU OWN directly to your MicroSD card, which I understand was a problem with Android, not Amazon (the problem occurred with many other non-Amazon apps).
 
 That being said... this app still needs major work.
 
 DLs of music I bought/own don't always work, but there's no indication from the app that they didn't complete. So you think you have the whole song, and instead you have only half or less.
 
 On top of that, it is SUCH A PAIN to try to delete and reDL the song, because this must be done from completely different screens and requires stepping back through multiple menus. It is neither easy nor intuitive.
 
 As a Prime user, I'm allowed to DL some Prime music I *don't* own for offline listening. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. The app won't tell you why.
 
 There's no way to remove the gaps between songs the way they would sound if playing a CD or album. There are FREE apps that let you do this or let you crossfade, which this app also doesn't let you do.
 
 There's NO graphic equalizer. Again, there are free music player apps that do this!",amazon
1/7/2016,"Many Prime songs and albums to choose from. You can build your own playlist and listen to it off-line (airplane mode to save battery life) if you download. You are not required to purchase music to build a playlist although I purchase my favorites to listen to on my mp3 player or memory stick while camping.
 However since my LG-G3 updated last night (08-11-16), the app is missing and will not install from Google Play Store or the Amazon site. Thankfully, I still have it on my tablet.",amazon
8/12/2016,"I am a huge fan and used of Amazon Prime- originally for the 2 day shipping and for the last year+ for streaming video. When the price jumped 25%, the general consensus was that Amazon would be adding another killer benefit to make up for it- and so it was when Amazon Prime Music was announced. I loaded up on albums I hadn't listened to in years, and marveled at the bargain that Amazon Prime represents.
 
 My daughter just got a new Android phone- a brand new, very recent model, relatively capable Android phone, with a brand new 16GB SD card (purchased via Amazon Prime!) installed. Amazon Prime Music was the second application loaded onto it- in fact it was a and she sat on the couch, delightedly perusing all the music she now had available.
 
 A few hours later the phone was staggering, and a quick check revealed the culprit- the internal memory was almost entirely occupied by Amazon Prime Music's data. Thinking that it ws just a matter of directing the data to the still empty SD card, I first perused the settings and then did some internet research revealed that this is not an option- the app only write to the internal memory. The 'Clear Cache' option helped for the short term, but the fundamental problem remains.
 
 It is a pity- this has the potential to be huge part of the cost-benefit calculation in favor of Amazon Prime. Instead, the benefit is essentially nullified, and one is let only with the (increased) cost.",amazon

10/16/2016,"This app is difficult to use and fails often. I have never used an app that made it this difficult to play music. It stops after every song so I have to go into the app and hit play whenever a song ends, there are weird noises sometimes when using this as app, and it isn't user friendly in any way. This app is garbage, it was coded by running thousands of rats over a computer keyboard. I would rather use a cheese grater to remove my toes then use this app any more.",amazon
9/8/2015,"Well, when lookaying for an alternative to Google Play, I thought for sure that Amazon would have their head on straight and would allow you to choose where the downloaded music is stored so that the memory limited main phone storage, which cannot hold my music collection, would not be crunched. Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well. There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application.",amazon
8/18/2013,"Today, i've updated the Windows Version of the Amazon Music Software to Rel. 5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400. Because the in software upgrade option didn't work (the update didn't finish / it tookay forever), I had to remove it manually via Control Center, downloaded the new version and installed it manually. After first start the login screen locked quite crappy, pictures missing, poor contrast, poor dialog layout. However, i've managed to login.
 In the new software within the thumbnail view, about 60% of the pictures are missing (hate that). If i click some artist and change back to the my music overview the software constantly changes from thumbnail view to list view (really hate that). If i click to prelisten a track in the shop, i'm always getting a message ""a problem has occured"" while everything seems to be working as expected, always have to close this error message before i can select the next track (very very annoying). In the programm settings, i've deselected Auto. Music Import several times now, but Auto Music Import from folder always reactivates itself automagically (why is this option there, if i'm not supposed to change it?). The whole new software feels very laggy in contrast to the old software, although i've got the fastest PC hardware money can buy these days.
 While i like the Prime service in general (especially free shipment and video) and while i like the prime music idea and having a backup copy of all my music tracks in amazon's cloud, this piece of crappy low budget software makes me reconsider my cloud music backup strategy. And it makes me hate amazon, at least for the next few days. The android app is not much better. I'm going to uninstall both and stick with Spotify and large Micro SD cards in my DAC and my phone.
 I hope the people at amazon start using their software themselves, try it out!!! Really hoping that amazon music software is going to be fixed soon. At least to a level that doesn't piss the user off, within the fist 10 minutes of use! Hate it, when service providers waste my time!",amazon

7/5/2014,"This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone. The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?",amazon

As a result (like other Amazon apps), they all take up so much memory in a limited memory phone that it makes it impossible to use.

3/9/2017,"I have 2 major complaints about the Amazon Music Android app.
 
 1. When playing music ""OFF-line"" (from tracks that have already been downloaded to my device), playback frequently pauses, as if it's having a buffering problem similar to a streaming (ON-line) connection. the interruptions to playback are incredibly annoying and don't happen on any other music player using the same device.
 
 2. There is no way to auto-play music on bluetooth connect. When I start my car, I want my music to start playing as soon as BT connection is established. The Amazon Music app does not support this feature. I have tried using other apps (Bluetooth AutoStart and others) and can successfully LAUNCH the Amazon Music app on bluetooth connect, but I am not able to PLAY music unless I unlock the screen and select the music I want to play.... Well.. If I already have Amazon Music App running on the phone, it will transfer over to the car and keep playing, but, that's only if the Music app is already running.
 
 For example... Black Player music app will auto-play on bluetooth connect from a cold start. Black Player doesn't need to be running. It just recognizes the BT connection and starts playing the song that was last played when it was turned off. This is the way a music app should work... of course you should have a setting to be able to turn off this feature if you don't want it...
 
 If Black Player can do it... why can't Amazon?",amazon

 Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. It's bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.
 
 Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure ""oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me!"". Wrong. It's genuinely terrible.
 
 Just today, I purchased 20 or so songs, but in order to retrieve them (oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS) I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history.

 Pros:

 3. Integrated with Alexa
 
 Cons:
 1. Stations and playlists are not curated/updated. Unlike Pandora or many other music services, the stations and playlists on Amazon are pretty much the same. For instance - any time you start the Classical station, the first tune played is Yo Yo Ma - EVERY TIME.. Amazon really needs to step it up in the curation management of their stations.
 2. Variety of playlists and stations suck. They have the generic genre stations and then they have stations by artist but there is no ability to select 3,4,5 artists and have the site dynamically create playlists/stations for you. I miss this feature the most from Pandora and find myself going back on occasion (with commercials) just to find different music that is similar to the music I already like. My kids use Spotify the majority of the time for this reason as well.

It has a duplicate choice in advance settings, but there is no option(or a way) for the user to run a duplicate command like Apple Music. Preference tab is very limited as well. These things makes this service well behind Apple Music, but like any other service it can be improved. The one big advantage Amazon music has over Apple is price.

I think Mr. Bezos should refocus on his company rather than the Post or space junk.",amazon
6/16/2014,"This app only does a few things, it's basically a music player with a built-in store. Being someone who uses Amazon Cloud Player, I expected this to work like a breeze but there are all kinds of problems.
 
 The main one is that across both this app and the Cloud Player, Amazon have a pathological problem with track ordering and identifying albums which has STILL not been fixed. Talk about keeping the main thing, the main thing, I can't imagine how they can't fix it. Uploading tracks from iTunes to Cloud Player lose their track ordering because some of them get the year and disc number and some don't. Album artwork that is taken from a completely different album even though the tracks I've uploaded all have the correct tagging. I thought this was perhaps a Cloud Player issue but...
 
 ...nope. This app seems to have the same problems. Take Presto, an album by Rush which I uploaded from iTunes. It brokaye like most albums did so I had to reset the tags in Cloud Player to make the track listings work and now they are correct. I recently bought a new phone and got this app, downloaded Presto from Cloud Player and....the app thinks it is two different albums so now if I want to play the whole album, I can't without creating a playlist. One of them is listed as Presto with the srtwork from Presto and has 3 songs on it and the other is also listed as Presto but with the artwork from Chronicles with the other 8 songs on it.
 
 How on earth have Amazon mucked this up so badly? They are supposed to be kings of online sales and probably sell a large percentage of the online music market but this is basic cock up 101. The fact it has not been fixed? Fail The fact that this occurs on two products? Fail The fact that it happens on the app even when the tracks are supposedly downloaded from Cloud Player which is setup correctly? Fail The fact you can't even force the music on the app to go to the correct place? Fail The fact that the app thinks that Presto by Rush and Presto by Rush are two different albums? Fail.
 
 Also, the tracks sometimes reset back to the beginning when playing.
 
 The only reason I don't move to another service is that iTunes and Google Music don't sound much better. There is NOTHING actually keeping me with Amazon other than that.",amazon
5/17/2014,"So buggy, i wouldn't use it if it didn't come with prime. I can't believe that amazon finds it acceptable. Music will often not load or the app will crash out mid session, if you make a playlist that has online and online music it can't play offline (just skip the online). I will download music and it still acts like it online music only. The app will turn on randomly and play music (happened once in a meeting which wasn't cool). In addition its painfully hard to exit the program on your phone, its like one of those bloatware apps that just wont go away once you opened it. It is easy to find free music or purchase music though and works on both iphones and androids. The iphone app seems to be less buggy then the android (no surprise).",amazon
9/22/2016,"It's cumbersome. It forces updates that don't automatically install on my system so I have to go in and download the entire thing again and install it in order for it to run properly (Windows 7 Ultimate). It doesn't allow me to choose where on my system I want to save the music, and it invaded my privacy before I could choose my preferences/settings by going through all the existing music files on my computer (most of which are NOT from Amazon) and making a playlist for me... While I like Amazon for a lot of other purchases, particularly Kindle bookays, I'm not buying music from Amazon anymore. Going back to iTunes.",amazon
10/26/2014,"I've been using Amazon Music for a few years, and enjoyed downloading purchases to my android phone so I can play my own music in my car. Now, however, I can't get through a single song through the car without an error message (exception 180) that stops the player cold. The error messages suggest I ""try again,"" but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I've PAID FOR from my device. This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Now, I have to find a music player that doesn't hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music won't play on any other player, that I've tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper. And, from what I'm seeing on these message boards, Amazon customer service hasn't even bothered to address this issue with the customers who present it. What a big FAT disappointment, Amazon.",amazon
6/5/2017,"It delivers good sound but I have noticed that searching for stations from the app is much less user friendly than the webpage version. Also, every time you touch something, it starts playing and then gets added to your Recent list. I cannot remove the lullabies station from that list, which uselessly takes up precious real estate. The other thing that is making me debate uninstalling is that it keeps starting on its own. After I have shut it down, by pressing the X, it keeps starting itself up again. After 5 or 6 closes, it stays closed.",amazon
9/28/2017,"Why Amazon can't get album covers right is beyond me. They use Gracenote. So does Apple where I rip the CD. Apple gets it right but when I upload to Amazon they can't get it right. I have spent hours on hours trying to correct album covers. Just gave up. There is an easy solution. Let me update the album cover on your website like Google Music does. What I have learned is that if you adjust music titles or album names, you might get the right cover to show. Also, having the right cover on the website does not mean that the right cover will show up on a Kindle Fire device. Or, it might be wrong on the website, but will be right on the Kindle Fire. Go figure. They have until my subscription expires to fix this. Too many other services that get it right to keep paying for this one. Apple gets it right. XBOX music gets it right. Google gets it right. When all three of these services don't, they let you fix it. Amazon does not, you are stuck with what they give you.",amazon
3/1/2015,"Nope, now they're forcing you into a pay to play. With the app you can no longer just search for a song and BUY it. You have to sign up for their new program and get a free month until you start paying. Guess I'll just keep the older songs I purchased, and mix in Pandora.",amazon
6/23/2017,"Prime membership makes this the perfect App for any mobile device, you can either download prime music to your device and for those who are worried about storage can always stream there music online and it's all included with the Prime membership. Lots of music to choose from and all free with your membership, if your song is not available free on prime you can always find deals on entire albums or just buy the songs you like while saving you more money in the long run. Automatically sorts out your music and you can add whatever it is to your digital library. This is very easy to use and would highly recommend using this if you are a Prime Member why pay for another music service when you have already paid for a Prime Membership make the most of Prime.",amazon
7/17/2015,Doesn't work with prime.,amazon
11/27/2016,"I get the ""Prime"" version with my prime account for free otherwise I wouldn't use it. The app itself is pretty lookaying but the functionality is average and the music service itself is below average.
 
 The real benefit of Amazon Prime Music is no commercials otherwise every other music app (Pandora, Slacker, etc.) is much better in every way.
 
 The available music is limited and music stations in Amazon Prime Music are horrible. My guess is that it's because they want you to buy the unlimited music service or because they'd have to pay the artist and don't want to in a ""free"" service. Example: The other apps have a ""top pop station"" where all the latest and greatest is played and the selection is excellent. Amazon Prime Music - not even close. Amazon claims these stations / play lists are created by experts. I'd add say it differently....they're created by experts who are limited by the music available.",amazon
8/23/2017,"I've used several different streaming music apps. Some tried forcing me to upgrade to get rid of ads and others won't force you but the ads are inserted in at ridiculous frequency! I downloaded this to try the no ads steaming with Prime.
 
 I like it! It's really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever. I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels. Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!
 
 The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora. Other than that, I like this app, I can pause, skip and shuffle. It definitely helps my day pass faster when I can listen to music I like while I'm working.",amazon
12/16/2015,"Music is a big part of my life. There are many week nights and entire weekends where my TV is never turned on because Id rather listen to music. And I'm no dummy when it comes computers/electronics. I work in that field. but I have to say that IM FED UP WITH THIS SERVICE for so many reasons.
 
 Below is an exceptionally confusing excerpt from Amazon Music Terms of Use, Updated June 2014. The link to the entire agreement is below.
 
 1.3 The Music Library Service. Amazons music library service (the Music Library Service) allows you to store, download, manage and play back Stored Music and Prime Music Content. Stored Music is your Music Content that you store in or access using the Music Library Service, including your Matched Music. Stored Music does not include Prime Music Content. There may be limits on the types of content you can store using the Music Library Service, such as file types we dont support. By using the Music Library Service, you are directing us to store, download, manage and play back Stored Music on your behalf. We may also provide you access to additional Music Content through the Music Library Service, such as lyrics.
 1.4 Matched Music. If we find that music you have purchased from us, or Music Content you have stored in or are importing to the Music Library Service, matches available Music Content from our catalog (Matched Music), you are directing us to store a personal copy of that Matched Music for you in place of your existing files or instead of uploading the files.
 What are they saying in 1.3 and 1.4? Can Amazon randomly choose to play music that they've Matched sucking up my data instead of playing the music I've purchased? What music are we directing them to store and where is it that we are directing Amazon to store and to download our music? What am I missing here?

 I have 25G of internal storage on my phone and most of it is used by Amazon Prime Music. What was the thought process that brought about the decision to store music that I have NOT purchased on my device? Why do I have to search my drive for my own music? I have to make sure that Im choosing the music Ive purchased, not the duplicate Prime music on my drive, or Ill use up all my data. Does Amazon have any kind of relationship with mobile data companies?
 
  Where is the Users Manual??",amazon
2/10/2015,"The entire reason I even bothered trying Amazon Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon Echo that my husband and I were gifted. My husband signed up for a 30-day Amazon Music trial to try it out with the intention of purchasing the $14.99/month family plan. Magically, 7 days into his trial, he was getting notifications saying his trial was up when attempting to play music. We had barely even had an opportunity to use it. Lookayed in the box that came with my Amazon Echo and found a 3-month credit for Amazon Music. Great! Applied it to my account and within a few minutes we were back to streaming music. Wasn't getting the best song or artist suggestions that I had seen with other services like Pandora and Spotify so I attempted to log in to Amazon Music on my laptop to organize playlists and was met with a screen offering a 30-day music trial AGAIN. Exhausted with the Echo streaming experience, tried Amazon Music on my Android device and even after verifying that I was signed-in on my account correctly, it acts like I don't have a 3 month credit so we weren't able to stream music while driving. Overall, pretty inconsistent user experience and much more trouble than it should have been to simply stream music. ""Credits"" don't seem to be true gift cards or credits so I would avoid that. Had in-laws in-town during the few days we had the trial and they said it made it seem like both Amazon Music and the Echo weren't worth their cost. Wouldn't recommend it to friends. Giving it 2 stars because it could at least play the majority of specific songs or artists that I requested but then again, other music services have had this figured out for years. I'll be sticking with Pandora.",amazon
1/2/2017,"okay, so i downloaded/installed this app on my Android Samsung S3 and it seemed to work fine. Played music, had all my purchases there, etc. All was good until I wanted to exit the app to avoid it running in the background and thus run my battery down and who knows what else in this day of NSA spying.
 
 I tried e-mailing customer service and got no help. I did call and did get to speak with a rep who informed me there is no exit button in quick fashion. Thanks, that answered my question. That is all I wanted.
 
 The whole thing is that every other music app I have on the phone has an ""Exit"" button available in it's menu. Sky Fm? Sure. Winamp? Better believe it does. Free Radio? Sure does, though it can be a bit clunky at times. Heck, even Anime Radio has an ""Exit"" button that shuts down the app.
 
 But this app? Nope!
 
 That is a serious flaw. Caused me to get rid of the app. It tookay using the Unistall menu option rather than just dragging it to the trash can, but at least it is now gone.
 
 And good riddance.
 
 If they ever get their act together and put in an exit button, I'll reinstall it.
 
 Perhaps Amazon just ought to stick to what they do very well, namely selling stuff and forget services.
 
 This one sucks due to the one fatal flaw.",amazon
6/12/2014,"This is one of my favorite benefits of Prime!
 No extra cost to stream music from all genres commercial free. I listen on my laptop, kindle, and phone with perfect back to back flow, no issues of any kind. There are so many free choices available, that my playlist is pretty much neverending!
 Great free choices, great service!",amazon
8/11/2015,"The last straw. I had switched from Spotify to Amazon music because Amazon had a few songs that Spotify doesn't and the music sounds a bit better from the Amazon app in my opinion. I am giving this app a one star rating for two reasons below and after submitting this review will be unsubscribing from Amazon music.
 
 1) This app constantly restarts in the background and drains the battery on my phone. I have had to install a separate app just to put it into hibernation
 2) A bug seems to have been introduced recently where despite there being 70 songs in my playlist, the app insists on repeating the same song endlessly. Selecting skip only returns to the songs beginning. The only way to get a new song is to manually select it. Not something I feel inclined to do- especially since I only used this app during workouts.",amazon
1/15/2017,"I am revising my assessment in the light of developments. My original harsh assessment was an accurate reflection of my displeasure of the reproduction of the newly released Best 50 Beatles' Songs. Playing them back via an Amazon Fire TV module to a Sony TV the tracks were a mixture of passable although degraded with respect to CD quality, but in others the voice track was entirely missing or so weak that it was hardly audible against the instrument background. My original reflex was to blame the sound engineers for sloppy control. I would now like to retract this negative assessment as I have found the cause although I don't understand the detailed mechanism yet. So I am writing this just in case others come across something similar. Let me add this only occurred on these Beatles tracks so I was fixated that it was the new tracks that were at fault. Well it appears they were not. In the early morning of post Xmas I reexamined the audio settings of my TV. Not those with altering the frequency response but ones connected to the speaker system. On changing my system to a dual system set to stereo voila the full tracks were reproduced. How this change can affect the selection of tracks within an individual tune I fail to understand. However I submit these details so that anybody else that is having such problems might investigate their own possibilities. I have also revised my star rating accordingly.",amazon
12/25/2015,"UNBELIVEABLE! The Amazon Music App will not install on my 2015 Amazon Fire tablet or original Fire TV! When I try the Amazon product page says it's not compatible. Argh!
 
 The product listing says it only requires Android 4.1 and both my Fire tablets and Fire TV have been updated to have OS versions based on Android 4.1 or newer. I'm blocked from even purchasing it (at $0 of course). Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for!
 
 Maybe I shouldn't complain as the old app works fine for me. On the other hand a lot of good music seems to be disappearing from Prime music and I expect the added cost music subscription may be needed in the future to get good tunes. Just feeling a little dark at a good thing like prime being eaten away in parts I care about.
 
 I hope Amazon isn't blocking all older devices from new apps. That would be bad. I'm giving this app only 1 star till this gets resolved, if ever.",amazon
12/19/2016,"This Amazon Music software is crap. It's as if they shoved it out the door without ever testing it. Just to address the playlist aspect (although there's plenty more that stinks). First I tried to import playlists from iTunes. It had the names of them okay and I checked all the boxes - but they never were imported into my library for Amazon Music. Not the songs in the playlists, not the names of the playlists themselves. Then I tried creating playlists in Amazon Music. I could create them okay - but when I tried to add songs by checking the boxes, it would do things like add ALL the songs not just the ones checked. Then scrolling down the alphabetical list I'd check a song or two to add to a playlist - and the screen would inexplicably refresh, erasing my checkmarks, and re-setting to the beginning of the alpha list.
 
 Whoever they had developing this software, they should fire them. Whoever they had testing it, they should fire them. Oh, they should fire the designers, too. It's clunky and it doesn't work.",amazon

So I go to create new playlists, but now the app REBOOTS MY PHONE after four or five songs play! I'm sure it is the fault of something else though, which explains the new player I downloaded played around 20 songs without missing a beat! Gee, I wonder where I should create my playlists? But Amazon Music does play music. It appears that the bulk of their programming efforts are in support of cloud access - I'm guessing, as I only stream music when on my wifi, and even then only occasionally. But that's okayay Amazon, I found a new friend in music!",amazon

The list of bands available was far less than I expected and ended up buying a few albums already. Keith Green is a major artist, Amy Grant, Petra are a few not on the list except a song or two. Please add more artists if possible. Thank you.",amazon

I am going to lookay for a different place to purchase music, I can no longer deal with trying to use this nasty, horrible, uncooperative, freezing, non-working software. Amazon you are forcing customers to use this instead of allowing them to choose how/where they want to download their music to/with. By forcing this nasty non-working software down the throats of your customers, you are losing customers. I refuse to purchase anymore music here. I cant spend hours trying to resolve the problems with the nonworking downloads, the freezing, the crashing. Its the end of my business purchasing music here, and I buy a LOT of music. I will also be canceling my subscriptions and other related services. It is hands down the worst software I have ever, ever, ever encountered.

6/17/2014,"Using Android app on Samsung S4
 
 TL:DR - App not recommended and will not use in its current state even when service is free. Buggy, prescriptive and not user friendly. Pity as the service itself seems quite good.
 
 Pros :
 Simple install/setup - picks up amazon account by itself from your device if you already have another amazon app
 Managed playlists are nice, good varied selection
 Lots of good music in there
 
 Cons :
 Automatically scans your device and inserts any other music it finds into the app's music library
  - no way to disable this
  - no way to exclude or remove songs located elsewhere on your device (it simply adds them back in when it scans again)
  - no way to filter library so it only shows music you downloaded through Prime Music - it mixes it with anything it found during the device scan
 No way to specify download location - defaults to using internal storage instead of external SD card, limiting downloads severely.
 Stutters fairly frequently during playback of downloaded tracks.
 No way to perform a multi-select of artists/albums/tracks within the library - have to perform actions on each one individually (adding to playlist/remove from library etc).
 
 more settings needed in the poorly populated 'Settings' screen such as :
  - specify download location
  - specify which folder(s) to scan for exiting music
  - disable device scan",amazon
10/23/2015,The music I listen to is usually a remake or some kind of remix crap that I can't stand. I also do not want to pay a dollar per song for my genre of music. Especially when i can get out my cds or download em free somewhere else.,amazon
3/8/2017,"The iphone version of this app seems to have constant issues. When opening the app it takes upwards of a minute for it to load and you to be able to access/select music, this assumes that it does not simply crash on you - which happens around 50% of the time. Not sure if it is Amazon or the iphone, but it is extremely annoying and difficult to use.
 
 If you allow your screen to turn off, it is another minute plus of fighting with it to get it to work.

8/16/2017,"I am very disappointmented in Prime Music and Amazon's new ""music unlimited"". One of the reasons we have kept our Prime membership was because of the music. This is a crappy way to treat customers and keep trying to find new ways to get more money out of them. I notice there are several of the song in My Music that are no longer available to me and they have designated a lot of the more popular stuff to the ""music unlimited"". Amazon should have at least allowed existing Prime members access to the same service they had prior to making the change. We will most likely be cancelling our Prime membership.",amazon

3/19/2017,"I want to start with this: my dad has nominally enjoyed the use of his Kindle Fire. But I am continuously stunned by how Amazon continues to pour cold water on the already sputtering flames in their app store. So many apps sit years without any possibility of a new update in sight. Sure, those 3rd parties aren't pummeling me for data on every aspect of my life... But that's probably because Amazon doesn't want to share.
 
 Regardless of that fact, I cannot fathom why, on the heels of their announcement regarding their new Fire Phone plus all of the rest of their attempts to draw consumers into their ecosystem, they would not have a proper update for their Kindle Fire customers. Not only does their weak app store show how they're catering only for the elderly-monied-suburban-dumb-phone-devotees, it also demonstrates how once they have those dollars they will make zero effort to be a useful platform.",amazon
6/29/2014,"I'd been satisfied using the old Amazon MP3 app for some time on my Galaxy S3 and was recently steered into this new ""upgrade"". I don't have Prime so I'm not at all interested in the new Prime features. In practice, I like to download my Amazon MP3 purchases to my phone's micro-SD card so I can play them anywhere without needing to use a network though this has always been a bit more involved than necessary since the old and new app have no option for selecting a different download storage device than my phone's ever shrinking built-in memory.
 
 I have to say the latest version - Amazon Music with Prime Music V4.0.4 - is quite disappointing. When I open the app to download new songs, it immediately displays a message that it is loading cloud songs before I even do anything. It is not clear why the app needs to load cloud songs or why this is taking so long because I have automatic downloads turned off in the app. Whatever the app is doing, it appears to slow the responsiveness dramatically. I then open my Amazon MP3 Library Recently Added list and tap the download icon. It can take a good 10 seconds or more before the app responds and begins downloading. Downloading appears to be much slower than in the old (non-Prime) version over WiFi. And downloading is extremely unreliable -- about one third of my new MP3 fail to download for an unspecified reason. After the list download ends, the app displays a red X next to the Recently Added list which can be pressed to retry downloading. This NEVER seems to work so I often have to scroll through the list of new songs manually, find each failed download and retry each song individually. This works for some songs but, for others, I have to cancel the download and then start a new download for it. During all of this, the app is excessively slow so it takes a while to determine if the app is going to actually retry downloading any particular song. And sometimes the slow response causes the app to switch modes and PLAY the song instead of popping up the retry menu for the song. There's no way to select a group of songs and then retry downloading, each song must be retried individually. After I eventually get all my songs downloaded to the phone, then I have to manually move them to the micro-SD card. Suffice it to say that this entire process is slow, painful and extremely frustrating. It is actually would be much easier and faster to remove the micro-SD from my phone and use my laptop to download my new Amazon MP3s directly to it. The only bright point in all this is that the app now seems to know which songs its already downloaded to my phone (the old version of the app would download songs and albums again and again and rename the files each time so it wasn't easy weed out the duplicates).
 
 Frankly, buying MP3s from Amazon and getting them on my phone has become much too time consuming and frustrating.
 
 UPDATE:
 Even worse than before. I'm lucky if I can get ONE purchased song to download to my phone

8/2/2014,"I've used the music app for years, mostly the iOS version and a few months ago started using the Fire Tv/Stick version and thought it was all right. The version just released recently is absolutely horrible however. No longer can you click on a song and select ""artist"" or ""album."" You just have the option to play it. A quick way of playing an album I recently purchased or uploaded was to just find it in the ""recently added"" playlist. Now you can just click on an individual song and listen to the entire playlist. What is really egregious though is when you go to ""my music"" you can get to your songs, artists or albums and they are in alphabetical order as before but what is missing is the alphabet menu shortcut we had before where we could jump to an artist like Joyce Manor for example, just by quickly scrolling to the J. Now you have to scroll through each individual artist name by name which if you have a large library can take quite a while. I feel like I'm being pushed by Amazon into relying on playlists and using the music app as if it was Pandora or something. I prefer my own library and that's what I want to play but this app makes that more challenging.",amazon

Cannot use voice commands properly, either. Most times, if it responds at all, it gives you something wildly different from what you asked for. This is basic functionality and has apparently been brokayen for some time or has never worked. I know Amazon and Google don't play nice with each other, but removing basic functions from their service is ridiculous. If I'm paying for a music service, I should be able to listen to it wherever and however I like.",amazon

With Prime music, one can select certain tracks to download and play on this app. However, the app tries to play songs from albums where I've downloaded other songs. For example, if I download ""My Life"" from Billy Joel's Greatest Hits, it will try to play ""Only the Good Die Young"" even if I haven't downloaded it. This causes the music to stop and I have to correct it. Sometimes, I even have to go back and start the shuffle again. Yes, it's on music from the device only so that's not the issue.

Locked in playlists! Doesn't use Android's internal playlist database, can't import/export playlists = lock-in to app, waste of my time, total horse s.... 4. User interface is poorly thought out IMO.

11/1/2017,"Until now, have been buying all of my digital music on Amazon and downloading it to my computers from the cloud player or from my shopping cart. Now I've got a new laptop, and I can't get an Amazon Music App for it without Prime Music being included. I have no need for streaming music, and I don't want the complication of an additional interface requiring me to take the extra step of rejecting ""listen free with Prime Music"" every time I want to buy a song. I want to pay for the songs and not be stuck subscribing to Prime forever.
 
 There are so many little glitches in the Amazon Music app already, (most recently, I bought 4 songs in one day and tried to download them all to one computer, but I got a message that I had to authorize my device before downloading songs 3 & 4 after the first 2 had downloaded to that same device) I don't want the additional frustration of having to manually prevent Prime from intervening in every attempted purchase.
 
 My solution - don't renew my Amazon Prime membership (so I don't qualify for free Prime Music services) or don't buy any digital music on Amazon.",amazon
12/20/2015,"First, to clarify, I am not new to streaming audio and have them all from Pandora to Tidal. There are pros and cons to each and everyone's preferences are different. For me, I like to pick a Genre or Style and have the app do the rest (Pandora). On the other hand, I like to reminisce and find specific Artist (Pandora,Spotify,Tidal.)That being said, I don't like to have certain Genres shoved in my face everytime I open the app (You Know who you Are.) Then, there is Sound Quality and WiFi vs Cellular ( Tidal and Spotify) for SQ and (Pandora and Spotify) for Cellular.
 
 Then there is the Skip limit thing which drives me nuts, you have to have Teen age girls to understand this one.
 
 Anyway, the New Amazon Ultimate Music is by far the Best Streaming Audio on the market today, SQ, Stations, Playlist etc...
 
 P.S I have cancelled Tidal and Pandora, my kids still prefer Spotify but when the Amazon Family option becomes available ( Late 2016) I will cancel them as well.
 
 Hope this review is helpful, Thanks",amazon

6/17/2014,"It's all right to have on in the background, no different than Spotify, except for one thing. Some of the songs don't sound right. Has anyone else noticed this? Hubs and I were both on our electronic devices with the Heavy Metal playlist going, and a Poison song came on and both of us thought it sounded just a little bit...off. Then this morning as we tidied the house with the 80s station on, ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" by Def Leppard came on. Only it was definitely NOT Def Leppard. I was/am big Lepps fan (today they're more of a guilty pleasure, ha ha ha) and I know the album Hysteria backwards and forwards. The song I was listening to may have been written by Def Leppard, but this version was definitely not performed by Def Leppard. The vocal harmonies were too slow, and completely unbalanced, where they used to be tight and perfect, no one voice could be heard over the others. Amazon seems to be too cheap to pay for the license to the actual album??? Kinda disappointed to be duped.",amazon

I do like that it gives you the opportunity to listen to and download music that I wouldn't normally listen to or search for. I think as a Prime Member the subscription price should be lower than what it is. After the 30 trial I'll make a decision to keep or stop, at this point I'm not sure if it's worth it.",amazon
8/16/2017,"Amazon Music, not quite ready for ""prime""time, and if I had to pay for the service, I'd request my money back.
 
 Heres why I say this. First, create your own playlist. It's kinda good, the prime catalog is lacking, and I have yet to discover the magic bean that will allow me to add my local music on my PC to playlists on my phone (same account) that I can achieve VIA google music. Add to that I added 500 songs to my prime playlist.. It repeats the same 20 songs, I don't even hear some artists I've added.
 
 Then came the ""stations"" these in theory are great, Pandora killer I thought.. But holy crap are the stations HORRIBLE. lets try punk rock. I hear the same 13-18 songs repeated. Half of which aren't really in the genre. Lets switch to the stations titled ""Van Halen"" One van halen song, then you'd expect a high energy classic rock song, nope.. Lets toss on something a lot slower by abba, stevie knicks or Fleetwood mac. Yeah, they're in the same class.
 
 Long song? No problem.. We'll cut it off before it ends...
 
 Add to that the app likes to stop playing, then start again, then stop again.. When writing this review I turned on the van halen station, connected to 4G, it would play one song and stop. Connected to work wifi, still played one song and stopped. Finally rebooted my phone, Plays one song and stops.. Not the best app in the pool at this time. Absolutely doesn't enhance my prime membership yet. Keep trying amazon..",amazon
4/22/2015,This has worked great for us to date. We made a play list for our wedding with this app (I am a Prime member). It's nice being able to take our favorite music with us and being able to save it to an SD card when no internet is available. Only precaution-- you can not change the order of songs on your playlist once you have created it. The first song you save becomes the last one to play and the last one you save the first one that plays. I wish Amazon would add the ability to rearrange the order of the songs on any playlist you create / save,amazon
11/6/2017,"I use the Amazon Music app to manage all of the music that I download from the Amazon music store. I do this without ever subscribing to Amazons music service, which is something I have tried and don't particularly like. (All of my digital music from Amazon is either Prime or purchased.)
 
 I have installed Amazon Music on all my Android devices except for, ironically, my Kindle Fire HD7  which has all of the Amazon Music features already baked in to its software. I find the Amazon Music app very useful for my purposes, especially now that its interface has been redesigned. I can sort my downloaded music almost any way I wish  by genre, song, album, artist, whether its Prime music or music Ive purchased.
 
 I also have Amazon Music for PC, so whenever I purchase an album or song, it automatically downloads to whatever device I happen to use to make my purchase. Amazon Music for PC will synchronize itself with my Android devices, so I can very quickly see my new music on my smartphone and tablets almost as quickly as it appears on my laptop.
 
 Amazon Music also serves as a music player on my devices. It does a very good job of sound reproduction, although its perhaps not quite in the same league with some other of the more full-featured (and expensive) music players.
 
 I am very pleased with the Amazon Music app. It serves my purposes well, even though I dont subscribe to Amazons music service. Highly recommended.",amazon
1/15/2017,"The best of music to your liking. Always has what you're lookaying for and always delivers great pleasure to hear what you choose to listen too.
 Because I have Prime, I get to pick so many songs without having to buy it, so my choices are endless. This was a genius development of great minds that got together to create something all and everyone could enjoy. It must have taken more than one mind, but if it was one man, wow!",amazon
1/23/2017,"Let me choose where the app caches music. I was getting Disk Full errors on my phone when I realized it's been storing the music I play in a cache on my INTERNAL STORAGE. When I lookayed to see if I could change the location, that option didn't exist.
 
 I had to plug the phone into a Windows machine and use Explorer to clear out the cached music. 1.8GB of cached files! Amazon, you can do better than that. Give us the option to set the cache location or give up on the cloud streaming business because this WILL NOT WORK.",amazon
12/6/2014,"This does not meet my expectations. I expect an app like this to allow me to organize my music and it does not. In some cases I have to scroll thru all my albums one-by-one to find what I'm lookaying for. Now if I want to pull up albums by genre I 'm out of luck. It appears that in many cases Amazon randomly selects a genre that is not ever close. If I want to listen to classic rock I can pull up by artist which is in reality the performer. If I want to listen to classical I am again out of luck. This app does not let you pull up by composer. Clearly Amazon does not want classical listeners using this app. I can try a search but that only helps if the composer's name is in the title. I have tried creating playlists, not to listen to but to categorize my albums. Once I pull up the playlist and decide what I want to listen to. I then go lookay up the name of the album and pull it that way.
 
 This is all such a shame because my Kindle for PC allows me to create all the categories I want and to beautifully organize all my bookays. Why can't this app? Who was the programmer on this? Clearly they were one of the few programmers on this planet that doesn't have a musical background. Another solution would be to use one of the external music apps like Tag Scanner which is the ultimate in organizing your music and plays it too. However all those prime albums you listen to, you would have to go buy so you can download them to your PC so an external app could play them.
 
 Amazon could easily reduce their customer's frustration by allowing us to categorize our albums like we can our Kindle bookays. The code wouldn't be that difficult. Just hi-jack some of the code from Kindle for PC and perform a little neurosurgery on Amazon Music.and you're good. My dogs are unemployed and they are pretty good coders. They'd be willing.",amazon

As far as the music app, it works okayay although the player could be improved by adding a volume control. I briefly switched from Apple Music and my catalog transferred flawlessly but I maxed out my Cloud storage the first day and can't add anything else without paying an additional $25 a year, another Amazon gotcha. They are fooling people into thinking they are getting services for free but they are fleecing your pocketbookay. Apple Music is not perfect but it has a lot of features I enjoy and the price you are charged is up front with no tricks or gimmicks.

Absolute garbage. The music importer worked quite nicely, then the previous iteration of this piece of muck started out okay and you could choose your file locations quite easily. This is just trying so-very-hard to be spotify that it's losing sight of what made it BETTER than spotify.

Sometimes the app saves it but half the time I am lookaying for what I last listened to which is annoying!
 
 Secondly, the UI is confusing. It list cloud, Prime music, library and store but it never really has the list right for what you were listening to or want to listen to. It is just really a pain to find music I want to hear, even my own music!
 
 Thirdly, how do you make a Playlist? I still haven't figured that out. The app is so painful to use I really haven't bothered.

There is absolutely no reason why this program should kill a laptop in order to play or download a song. I have also noticed that not every song you purchase and download from Amazon is set up to be downloaded through the Amazon Music app, some are still coming down as a zip file. There needs to be a standard for downloads and then stick with it. I will stick with Amazon for a little while longer and if it doesn't improve, I am done with it.

I was able to make playlists which was nice but when I play the playlists it stops after every couple of songs (receiving notifications does not make a difference in the playlist, it just stops playing randomly) but then other times it plays all the way through...I would say this is the biggest frustration. Also, it is slow at downloading. When I had rhapsody it was lightening fast, almost so much so I would lose track of where I was!

 3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist. Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums. This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.

 5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks. The ability to thumbs up / down or star tracks is sorely missed.
 
 6. Video Content - None
 
 7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms. If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.
 
 8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow. It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing. This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.
 
 9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to... Show me similar artist, records, songs. Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!
 
 10. Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature. However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.
 
 11. Android Screen controls. The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android. There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).
 
 Overall the service is adequate. There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market. I signed my family up for a year. They all hate it! We will give the service a fair shake over the year. If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again. I expected better from Amazon. okayay is not good enough.",amazon
2/20/2017,"I don't want to stream music but I do want to download digital music I purchased from Amazon. This app did it. It also found every other MP3 file on my computer and added them to this app. I deleted them all from my hard drive and Amazon Music still has them listed among the albums I just purchased and downloaded. I just want to play music in my car from a USB drive. I don't need or want this nonsensical app.
 
 After moving the recently purchased albums to a USB drive, Amazon Music decided to download them again. I lookay at the settings and there is apparently no way to turn this off.
 
 This app is going to make me spend hours doing something that could be accomplished in minutes before Amazon forced me to download the app to buy music. As soon as I get my new albums copied from my hard drive, I'm going top delete this app and just not buy digital music from Amazon any more.",amazon
8/10/2015,"Always something to listen to, new releases are released shortly after their debut, and the sound quality is very good for streaming with no buffering over LTE and wifi. The overall addition of this service makes it a much better value than n**flix. I don't watch movies every day but I will listen to music on my commute, Amazon got this right.",amazon
8/21/2015,"Crashes every time I want to play a song that's downloaded to my device (android 4.4) whether or not I'm connected to the internet at the time. Of course, I downloaded my most played songs to avoid needing an internet connection every time I want to listen to music which means the app is basically useless to me. I CAN still play songs that aren't downloaded to my phone UNLESS they were previously downloaded. That's right, even if I remove the song from my library, trying to play it still causes the app to crash.
 
 Update
 The app is now fully functional and allows me to play downloaded music as well as stream audio. The redesign isn't as easy to navigate as in previous versions, but it still gets 5 stars because the functionality is there.",amazon
1/6/2015,"This thing is bad. I've used several others and this is by far at the bottom, which surprised me coming from Amazon. The way you upload a big library like I have to the cloud is atrocious. I have been trying for days to get my approximately 120GB's (and that isn't even that big of a library), up for days. On top of that, they should have an option to point to your music folder and keep track of your personal library and sync your library with your cloud, so its always up to date.
 
 Amazon, get it together.",amazon
3/29/2017,"UPDATE: My original review was circa 2012. My how times have changed. The Amazon Music app is now my go to app for streaming music and listening to downloaded music. If you have Prime, take advantage of the stations, playlists and free music!
 
 ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA 2012: I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.
 
 Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps. Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012. Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.
 
 Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix.",amazon
10/24/2012,"First off, the sound quality and selection is fantastic. I would rate that alone at 5/5. If you listen to a large variety of music on a regular basis, the service is great.
 
 BUT, finding music, is a chore. Artists are easy enough to find, but actually getting to an album you want is tricky. The majority of my listening is full albums. From the album selector for a band, there is NO distinguishing between singles, EPs, or full albums, nor is there any note of year (year is visible once the album has been selected, but I've already seen several where the year was blatantly wrong, or listed the year of the re-issue, which is technically correct, but generally misleading). This is a NIGHTMARE for bands with several albums, especially artists who name the album after a title track, release the album, a clean version of the album, a limited edition of the album, the title track as an EP, and again as a single. It's common for me to ""view all"" albums, and it's 3+ indistinguishable links, all with the same album art and name.
 
 I've also had technical issues stemming from album selection. For example, from the ""my recommendations"" screen, I can click to an album, and I can add the album to my music, but from the band's page, that album is NOT in their list (specific example below). Furthermore, a band's list of albums is not its own screen, it's a kind of popup, so when I select an album, if it's not the one I want, and I hit back, I am returned to the band's main page. Not their list of albums, forcing me to repeat this cycle.
 
 For reference, the album I can listen to, but not find on the band's page is ""The Nexus"" by Amaranthe. I think the confusion there is that ""The Nexus"" is also a single, and there are two entries for said single in the band's album list, and I think one of them should be a link to the full album, but is not.",amazon
2/20/2017,"this is the slowest app that I have experienced recently. It is slow to load, slow to update, slow to make changes (order of playlists). I can't believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle, Spotify, etc. The only advantage of this app is that it is cheap. But, functionally, it it terrible. I have been an Amazon customer an Prime member for 5 years, but I have to admit that their venture into the music world leaves a lot to be desired. Amazon, you can do better with the (almost) unlimited resources that you have. Spend some more time and money on this application and you could be the best, but if this is what you are willing to invest in this, users, please go elseware.",amazon
12/23/2015,"I keep all my music on Amazon Cloud. I use this app to listen to my stuff on my phone. This latest update, 3.0.2 is the reason I gave it 2 stars. When you're listening to an album, you used to be able to add another to the ""now playing"" list. This is no longer an option. Also, the reaction time when you do something, (Skip a track...play a different album...scan forward in a track...) is significantly delayed.
 
 Time for a version rollback !I wish.
 
 Another ""feature"" I just discovered: When you add an entire album(s) to a playlist, the stupid application plays the tracks in a random order. (I don't really know if it's random, I didn't qa test for randomness) This is mildly annoying for music, pull your hair out annoying for audiobookays.",amazon
12/7/2013,"I share a membership and pay half with my 76 year old mother. Because it's in her name, I can't access songs that would be free. She has zero use for it. If only one person on Prime can get free songs and apps, we should be able to designate that member ourselves.
 I also couldn't download my purchase to my phone without it asking me to change my settings to allow downloads from ""unknown sources"". Who on earth would change settings on their phone to open it up to all? I've yet to log on to my computer to finish downloading it into my Amazon Cloud, and haven't even been able to hear it yet. The general permissions I had to accept for the app were way outside of normal apps, but making general changes to accept unknown downloads is nuts.",amazon
11/11/2014,"I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.
 
 First I will say a few positives, the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think $7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.
 
 Now the Cons - easy things to fix:
 1. On the App, make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song, artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said, most other music apps are just as poor in this area - not a good excuse though.
 2. The music recommendations for offline mode - I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full. So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it won't try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for, offline music.
 
 Now the Cons - harder to fix, or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums, others are complaining as well:
 3. Integration with Echo - When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day, Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse, it doesn't even shuffle on the command ""Echo Shuffle My Music"" or ""Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account"". On this command, echo starts with the same songs until I say ""shuffle"" again and skip a song. Then it says ""enabling shuffle mode"" and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is brokayen and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10,000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the $25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up.
 4. Related to #3, when I do use the shuffle command, it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them, but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again, a month ago this was opposite, I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play, only Prime songs will shuffle, now it is reversed.
 
 I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time. If this improves I will update my review.",amazon
11/4/2016,"I was thrilled to see this app which will complement my prime membership. However, there is not enough prime music available. The app is mostly for selling music. I'd buy Spotify instead. I hope Amazon will improve the selection.",amazon
7/7/2016,"I'm using the IOS app. It actually works pretty well. It seems that some albums in my library need a little update in the metadata, and it will be easier to find the stuff I'm lookaying for.
 
 I've got about 30k songs in my collection. I'm trying to upload all those so that I can access them across all my devices (including my echo). The Amazon music program on the PC and MAC are by far the worst cloud upload program I have ever worked with. Let me list the problems:
 
 1) I've got a 4-core 8-thread core i7 machine, it maxes out all my CPU in order to do 3 parallel streams of uploading. On my macbookay pro, it shows 110% CPU on a 4 core machine. Uploading a file should not be a CPU intensive process. It slows down my entire PC, where typing stuff into a web browser is about 1 character a second.
 2) The underlying threads kindof work (I get lots of ""Cloud Service Not Responding Errors""), you have to go back through and ask it to retry files one at a time. Because it's so slow, it takes about 30 seconds to actually select, hit retry, and click ""got it"" and have the popup dissappear.
 3) The UI hangs, so you have no idea what it's actually doing. I have to resort to hitting refresh on the browser on the website to see what has actually been uploaded. It gives a popup when the upload is complete, but that only happens about 20% of the time (if you're uploading 5 songs at a time). If you upload like 100 songs at once, then it just hangs and shows busy forever (even hours after it completed uploading the last file). You have to quit the program, and go into the task manager and actually kill it. I now do that between every upload.
 
 Amazon solutions are typically very good. The kindle programs work amazingly well. This one is total crap, which is a shame for an otherwise very good service (from what I can tell). If they can get this fixed, then their offering should be very competitive.",amazon
11/21/2016,"How can this app STILL not allow you to save purchased music to an SD card? How simple was that to program!? OH MY GOD..

You wasted too much of my time figuring this nonsense out and to resolve the problem this app creates (going forward) involves taking out the SD card (periodically), and doing all sorts of rigmarole to reorganize the files onto the SD card via my computer?!!

11/26/2016,"This app is clunkier than Windows Vista. Heavy, unmanageable, buggy, and virtually unusable are the strong points. At least Amazon MP3 was intuitive and relatively usable. The first thing this piece of trash does is hit you over the head with a pop up ad for Amazon Prime. For all the money I spend at Amazon, I don't need the hard sell. You already get most of my money. Until now. Much of my purchased music did not transition from old to new. When I called MP3 customer service, I was advised to re-install the app. After the third time and significant language barriers, I gave up. Amazon sensed a problem when I hung up after being on hold for the 4th time. I received a call back asking if there was a problem. I said no, I was getting established with I-Tunes at the moment. Amazon sent an immediate email giving me a $7.98 credit to be used at their music store. Wow. What's next Amazon? World peace? Fire this non-beta testing software developer, give us a usable app, and I'll come back wagging my tail. Final thought: Amazon, you have impressed me since your name hit the streets. The fact that you're shoving this drek at us tells me you've lost your way. Disappointed? More than you know. Wow.",amazon

It's very frustrating because I can no longer save music to my sd card, the app has crashed several times, and I am getting a lot of download error messages. It is bad enough that I am considering going tomorrow and buying an IPhone and never buying music from Amazon again. Also a better Prime benefit would have been unlimited cloud drive storage for music rather than a million songs that just take up the very limited storage space on my phone or kill the battery if I try to stream it. It also would be a very good idea to make it available to use on the kindle fire and Fire TV.",amazon

Now they are trying to make me pay extra to listen to music that was originally free!? And I have so many songs that if I don't upgrade to this new premium standard I have to either A: one by one download every song through a new app. Or B: Be forced to upgrade to keep my music. I thought amazon was awesome before and now they are getting greedy and I guess my money for prime is now not enough. Very disappointed,amazon

8/8/2015,"I like this app but we recently just started using it more and I realized that the library of Prime is very mainstream. We listen to a multitude of stations that play songs I've never heard before and when searching for quite a few of those songs, they are not found. The app is used on an Android and loads sufficiently, but connection could be dependent upon carrier. Overall, I am glad I have it, but I hope that the available tunes will be expanded to those that are less mainstream, and leave you wanting more after hearing them play on Sirius.",amazon
11/2/2015,"Trying out the 1-month free membership as an add-on to my Prime membership.

However the search feature rarely gives the results I am lookaying for, and I cannot search only in ""Playlists"" or ""Stations""... The biggest complaint I have with this version of Amazon Music is the amount of CPU power and memory it has requires from both my laptop (Dell Inspirion 15 7000 Series) and my phone (Samsung Galaxy S7). On my laptop I notice an immediate lag in the operation when I open the app. Amazon Music consumes the most CPU power and is the second largest user of memory. Since I've installed the app on my phone, my battery is down to 50% by lunch and by 5 P.M. I will have less than 5% battery life.

You will see in my screen shot I enabled Airplane mode to emulate data loss and show you what is happening.

9/30/2013,"I hate typing bad reviews, but maybe Amazon may listen. I have been using the Amazon Music app on my computer for a few years, so I have experience with it. I am also a Web Developer, so I know how to use a computer. When the latest updates for this app arrived, I was immediately put off. If all you do is play music, it works fine. Uploads are not intuitive at all.
 
 In the older version, when you wanted to upload music, you added it by choosing a file/folder with a browser, or you dragged files/folders onto the app. Then, you saw the list of songs with an uploading icon next to the ones in queue, and the finished ones indicated as such. After uploading, you could clear the queue, so the next time you upload something, you could see exactly what was happening.
 
 Now, you drag files/folders onto the app, as before, but only the songs that are actively uploading or finished are displayed. Unless you counted, you have no idea how many are left to upload. They only get added as they upload. And the queue list shows everything you have ever uploaded, so if I want to see what is in progress, I have to find it in the list. I have thousands of songs. Unless I search for the songs that are uploading, I have no idea it is even working.

Loading ""songs"" is tricky (don't like calling a concerto a song), seems to work better with Windows Media Player references than with iTunes references (on a Windows computer), and most nearly dependably if simply directed to the drive folder containing the music files.

I want only instrumental with artists that do instrumental. I had to do a thumbs down 4 times in an hour for Whitney Houston alone on a channel for a composer that only does instrumentals. Please hire someone from Pandora to fix your issue!!!",amazon
8/20/2016,"The problem with amazon prime instant video and amazon prime music is that amazon removes media out of the clear blue. One minute your movie and music are there. The next minute they are gone. without warning. At least with netflix, there is a heads up of what movies will be no longer offered as part of their service. Overall I think the amazon prime service is a ripoff considering what it offers. The 2 day shipping is great but that part isn't always executed to perfection, especially when it comes to 3rd party sellers (marketplace). You would have to buy a lot of product to really get your hundred dollars worth. The media selection part of prime (music and movies) is barely good enough.",amazon

1/29/2016,"I have been purchasing all of my music on Amazon for the past several years. I purchase and download all of my music and generally have never streamed it, this was the first time. I only downloaded this app to my phone because I wanted my daughter to be able to play some select songs in the car. When I did the download I specifically chose not to start the ""service"" but just to add the app in order to play the music I had purchased, but in the process saw that prime (of which I belong) had some music groupings that might interest me. We enjoyed playing the music in the car for a short time using the app because I hadn't downloaded the music to my phone. It tookay a while before I realized the thing didn't shut off. Got to work one day went to task manager and closed the app. Got out of work and realized it was still playing and had been ALL day, and using up my data. Pulled down the drop down menu and there it was, still playing. Just picked up my phone this morning and realized it has been playing some unknown music all night.................it's gone, going back to hookaying up the phone and downloaded my purchased music that only costs me ONCE.",amazon
2/11/2017,"Two primary things about this app.
 
 1. It constantly loses your playlist options. Add a couple songs, switch to a new album to add some more and the first ones are gone making it impossible to play songs from more than one album. Same artist loses track as well.
 
 2. The UI for the application is one of the most difficult to navigate compared to other music apps. Be prepared to tap through screen after screen to find what you want. Items with a prime discount are not clearly represented and intermixed with everything else, as well as one screen showing you they're $0.00 and another showing the same song as one you have to buy for $1.99. Also be prepared to have 1/2 the songs on an album free to stream but you have to pay full price for the album. Not sure if that's due to an industry deal or not but seems bogus when buying the other half the songs costs less than the cost of the album.
 
 I was very excited when I thought I might be able to listen to music on my phone instead of carrying an iPod as well as the phone, but I'm keeping the iPod. Amazon has created just one more mediocre half-baked Amazon product. Very disappointed but not at all surprised.",amazon
6/17/2014,With all the free music apps out there it makes no sense to own this app. I'd rather put up with pop-up ads that pay for the music then have me pay for it. 1200 songs I have and never paid a cent,amazon
4/30/2016,"I *hate* the new user interface. I use the app on my FireTV with a Logitech Harmony remote (so no voice control - a worthwhile sacrifice to consolidate all remotes). The new interface completely does away with the ability to jump alphabetically through your songs and albums. You now have to scroll all the way through your library staring with the numbers and slowly making your way through each and every title in your library. I have hundreds of albums and thousands of songs. This interface change has made the music app useless to me, and negated a big part of the reason I bought the FireTV in the first place. I really hope to see this addressed soon.",amazon

11/10/2017,"1. The Amazon MP# player does not have a setting to store the music off of your internal memory. I travel a lot on business and only downloading 6 albums is not enough. To move your mp3s to an external SD card in your phone takes using ES File Explorer or similar app.
 
 2. The problem is even if you do that the Amazon MP3 app will not find it on the SD card. I ended up trying to use the built in music player on my Samsung Galaxy S4 but wait! the file names are now corrupted. Basically Amazon has chosen to add their gibberish lookaying item numbers to the front of file names such as B00134NFVG_(disc_1)_02_-_You're_No_Different. This makes it impossible to index on other players. So much for no copy protection take your music anywhere. It has changed to take your music anywhere through Amazon's player, and stream it even though you have to pay your cell carrier extra for the 250mb per 30 minutes it takes to steam music because we won't let you store the music on external storage.
 
 3. I have over 11,000 tracks on Amazon Could but only pick and choose a handful to download. When I stream or download the songs the albums show tracks in the wrong order. Try listening to Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon out of order. (There are many albums produces in a certain order & Amazon screws this up - been like this for years. Never fix it)
 
 3. I am also having issues with a single album being indexed by Amazon as two to four different albums each with a few songs on them. Click play album {so and so} and it will play 3 or 4 tracks and stop. Pull up the app and you will see where they are split up incorrectly.
 
 This app used to be pretty decent but it has gotten much worse over a few years. Now I am going to search for a new alternative whether it is Google, Apple or just manage it on a home server and keep 3rd parties and the music industry out of it.",amazon

Finally, the newest update won't even open without crashing and it keeps trying to open itself and ends up in a &#34;crash loop&#34;.

Furthermore, it won't let you put your Amazon-bought music into a folder of your choice to live with your other music. In addition, it heavily favors streaming, which isn't why I *buy* MP3 albums! I want to *have the MP3 on my device* to save on data and play when I have no signal. *Not everyone lives where they have good, constant signal!* This app is too reminiscent of iTunes and its user-adverse interface and method of railroading the user into using *only * this app...if the app was decent and allowed me to play and use non-Amazon music *without chokaying my phone to death,* maybe I'd use it.

So heres the deal, it by itself does not function on a phone at all, because thats the only place it works inside your Internal Memory. It's like they adapted a less sophisticated software to rush it to the market and went with it. They fixed the problem by making you discover through phone failure by reading reviews or by another means that they recognized the problem and really want to just sell you another app and download Amazon Apps. You will need to download their Amazon MP3 Mover in order to move songs to your SD Card. But it doesn't always work. It leaves off artist names and titles often so it has a lot of bugs. While the Amazon Player will not see the titles that it moves, the Android Music player will, so go figure. I really liked Amazon Music Player until I realized what it does not do. So one star, because Amazon knows the problems and can't seem to get it right. Really who can store all their music in Internal Memory.

With the new ""blue"" release, I am back to downloading .ZIP files like it's 1999! This poor interface takes away the entire incentive of skipping cd purchases.
 
 As a prime member who purchases both hard and digital media, I am no longer purchasing digital (unless it's dance music), instead I will go back to CDs and rip them myself.
 
 Amazon, this iteration is complete crap. You can do better than this!",amazon
11/5/2016,"UPDATE:
 
 I find that I use this app less and less. I think the most annoying part is that it ALWAYS tries to sync to your cloud library as soon as you launch it. On the surface, this isn't a bad thing. But the problem is when you don't have solid data coverage or wifi, like in a tunnel or in a building with thick walls. As it tries to sync, the app freezes and you can't do anything but force close it.
 
 Ideally, there should be an option to sync only on wifi or manually by pressing a button. I have several albums downloaded/cached locally and never stream. So the app should just play those local albums and forget about trying to sync any other songs I have in the cloud. Sheesh.
 
 ___________
 I downloaded this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. It's actually not a bad app, even if you don't have Prime or don't purchase music. It recognizes/plays non-DRM music that's already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple, responsive, and not annoying. I like it a little more than the Google Music app. And it's much better than all those free apps that either have limited features or annoying ads, unless you pay up.
 
 I'll also echo my complaint here about not being able to store Prime/purchased music on the SD card. It's really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card, but not any of the music. In a perfect world, we'd have unlimited/reliable mobile data everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality is, we still need to download/cache locally to our mobile devices. Hopefully, Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchased music on the SD card.",amazon
6/29/2014,"This is my go to music app and I find it easy to understand. I can compile my own playlists. If you upgrade to Amazon unlimited (79/yr for prime members) a vast amount of content is at your disposal.

6/17/2017,"The page needs to be refreshed a lot- an issue never experienced with spotify. It's not as bad as youtube where for each video/song you need to click on the tab/window again. (Then again youtube can be used for free.)
 
 Aside from random pausing of music, there is a decent selection of music- some artists I wasn't expecting them to have. Although, many artists are not available and very few are available with a full album collection.
 
 It works for me since I already have prime, which is well worth it for how much I order. I'd give it 4 stars without the streaming errors and 5 with a better selection.",amazon
3/5/2017,"The selection is much smaller than most other streaming services, and Amazon Music doesn't even have all of the music which Amazon sells, meaning I can't even use it to listen to many of the CDs I bought with Amazon.
 
 Then, if I want to download my music I've bought with the ""AutoRip"" that Amazon emails me about every time I buy a compatible CD, that's awful, too. If you buy a CD on BandCamp - a much better service if you're buying albums digitally - it asks you what file format you'd like. Amazon Music doesn't; Amazon Music says you'll get .mp3 and you'll like it. Of course, Amazon Music doesn't give you just any .mp3, because they had the forethought to give you your music in 292kbps. That's right, Amazon Music gives you decidedly lower quality music than other services. For a service built around music, Amazon Music should offer at a minimum 320kbps or V0.
 
 If you care about quality, I wouldn't bother. I know I won't ever use it again unless I can download a lossless rip.",amazon
1/15/2017,"why in today's world do updates always seem to mean making things worse. this app was okay before. not great by any stretch of the imagination, but it worked 'okay'. now it does not work okay. it is even less user-friendly, more clunky, unwieldy and just difficult to use. i cannot comprehend how or why this could have happened. i understand apple's music player on iphones is designed to be clunky to 'subliminally' push people towards their paid content. but i don't understand this. we are already paying for eg prime.
 
 my recently added playlist contains only one album, that was not recently added. it doesn;t include any of the music i have bought in the last 48 hours. this does appear in the purchased playlist though. downloading to my mac now appears to take 1000% longer than it did. and the format of naming artists and albums has changed. you can't use the shift key to select multiple items to download. it is awful.

10/10/2015,"Very poor app. As of 3-4 days ago the PC app started crashing constantly on launch and would not run. The ""blue"" interface is horrendous and extremely confusing.

Why do I need to waste time for this useless operation? Why does it not let me listen to the music while it is ""syncing...""? Why does it not sync in the background?
 Frankly, the more I use Amazon software the stronger is my belief that it is on par with Microsoft's in terms of confusing UI, marketing-first approach and ""beta"" quality.

As far as maneuvering when using the app, it seems to be extremely sensitive....you can scroll down and all of a sudden what you were working with is gone, or hover over something for a second and you're another spot. My search bar doesn't work, it pulls up nothing, so I've been scrolling to find stuff and I have A LOT of music (see my complaint about scrolling). Much of my downloaded music is missing information and I have to manually fill it in otherwise music isn't where it should be...for instance, I had an album that was downloaded as 12 separate songs because there were no track numbers. I can't click and drag one album or artist to another area, so anything from, say, Joan Jett is separate from anything filed under Joan Jett & the Blackhearts...I have to manually change the info. Many albums have the wrong album cover art, sometimes even belonging to another artist, and some albums have no art whatsoever....there doesn't seem to be a way to copy an image from the internet, so I can't fill it in manually. The app is visually boring. I liked it so much better when you downloaded and it went straight to Media Player...Media Player is a far better app.",amazon

The previous version of the app was very good, allowing me access to my Cloud music and the music store. As it was, I would have given it 4 stars. The reasons for the loss of one star were that 1) You can't store music on an SD card, and 2) You can't sync playlists from the device library to the Cloud. Otherwise, it was a very good music player.
 
 However, with the new update, I am of a VERY different opinion. This new update is so full of glitches, it's almost unusable. The correct album art rarely shows, songs take FOREVER to load (even when they're on my device!), I can hit the 'skip' button a dozen times and the song won't change (although the song title text and album art will!). It also runs MUCH slower than the previous version. I'm quite certain it's not my device- I'm using a Galaxy SIII, on which all other apps just fine. I'm giving it two stars because the new layout is very nice, but that doesn't really count for much when the app itself hardly functions.

9/30/2015,"I've been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service. Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it. Well, I'm wrong. My husband has already declared ""it sucks!"". But I don't listen as often and I have more ""mainstream"" tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no. Here is a short list of why I don't like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible. So much so that, even though it's essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I'd rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app. The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain won't recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud. Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are ""re-recorded""versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song. I've not run across this with Spotify or Google Play. What's the deal with this scam?
 
 In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song (good luck if you can find it on Prime Music) . But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else.",amazon

9/3/2017,"The app itself lags behind competitors in appearance of the UI, fluidity, song selection, and price.

 It's just unnecessary and costly. Honestly the only reason I cared for Prime was the shipping benefits, but when they decided to attach video (again not as good as netflix or hulu) and music to it and double the price, I cancelled my membership renewal. I would prefer a tier set up where you can elect which services you want, but i suspect that would reveal just how overpriced the services are and Amazon would lose too much money to keep them around.",amazon

This process tookay forever, but I thought it would be a great way to keep everything organized, and it worked for a while. Now the app does not work if you have more than 40,000 songs, so I am trying to get a local copy of MY music for home listening, and here is where the problem gets RIDICULOUS.
 
 In order for me to get a copy of MY music I need to download the Amazon Music app, but the app does not work if you have a library larger than 40,000 songs. So I go to the website, and it is restricted to 200 songs at a time, and there is no stacking. In short it simply does not work for large files. So it will take me about a month to get all the songs, and this is with pretty constant attention. What I find amazing is importing was easy, but 200 songs per download means Amazon is flat out creating a barrier for customers to leave the service, and I find this unacceptable. I spend over $5,000 per month with Amazon and have for several years. I am an Amazon fan to say the least, and this is the first time Amazon has disappointed me in such a large way.",amazon
3/18/2016,App continually stops working. Sometimes never connects on network. Only works at home on wifi.,amazon
8/20/2017,"Just writing a review to give feedback. When I open the app to listen to offline music but have poor reception, it takes forever to load. If I turn off my internet connection, it loads instantly. Obviously there's a ""phone home"" check going on, and if you delayed that or did it in parallel, the app would perform much better!
 
 Otherwise, it's an okay app. I count Amazon music as a nice bonus to prime - certainly not why I got prime, but nice to have anyway",amazon
6/9/2017,"okay, have been a prime customer just about ever since I can remember. Joined Prime Music this year, tookay a while to get use to it over Pandora, but was fine until today. Went to my favorite play list and there were a bunch of songs that were Prime music and use to play all the time, and now the Prime logo is greyed out, and a prompt comes up with remove or buy. Truly a bait and switch tactic, that could almost be considered against the law. Second issue, last month I uploaded or I should say tried to upload discs out of my personal library. What a pain, they would only allow certain songs to be uploaded to my prime account, dialog box stated: incompatible format. Odd, they play on everything else I own. Most likely a licensing or royalty issue. Not at all happy now. I had a Stevie Ray Vaughn album that was all Prime Music, went to play today, all greyed out, they want me to buy now.Iit wasn't uploaded, don't own a copy. I will provide an update if I hear from them. I don't like surprises, don't think anyone does.",amazon
10/3/2016,"Confusing, horrible interface. CANNOT UNINSTALL UPDATE once you apply it. Cloud/Device tabs are gone and how you find your existing music is a complete mystery. Impossible to tell whether you're purchasing music or getting it through Prime. I'm uninstalling this app completely. Amazon Prime music is definitely not ready for prime time. Thanks for pushing out a crappy app without giving me the ability to roll back to the old, much more elegant interface.",amazon
6/15/2014,"I use this app on my Nexus 7--a Google product--and it doesn't allow me to listen to the Amazon Prime Stations. Not sure this is by spiteful design or simple indifference, but it greatly limits it usefulness to me. IIRC, it wouldn't install at all on my Coolpad Quattro cellular, further making it of little use. Works okayay on my various PCs, where I also utilize strong competitors such as Pandora, Spotify, or Slacker. I would have given it only 2 stars except I do like the categorical choices for the stations (when I can see them!).",amazon
4/5/2015,"I like the Amazon MP3 music player and use it daily. It is able to access both the SD card on my phone and the cloud player. Easy interface to use and browse your music.
 
 My only gripe is that it puts a delay between tracks even when there isn't one on the original album. I like to listen to a lot of Frank Zappa and and other classical music (yes, I said Frank Zappa and classical music in the same sentence!) and many of the tracks are supposed to blend from one into the next without a pause. Itunes and Windows media player can do this, Amazon MP3 player should be able to do it as well. Try listening to Wagner:""The Ring Without Words"" and the gaps between sections will drive you nuts. I would give this a 5 star rating if they would fix that problem.
 
 UPDATE 1/27/14 - Amazon has updated the MP3 player since I wrote this review. Now, the player does not insert the delay between tracks and the songs flow smoothly from one to the other. I can now listen to my Zappa, Beethoven and Wagner as they were meant to be heard - uninterrupted! Highly recommended.",amazon
12/13/2012,"DISAPPEARING CONTROLS ?!#? Need I say more? How idiotic. Believe it or not this is not the only Windows program or app I use. Having controls at the top (iTunes), some at the bottom (Amazon), etc. and then have them disappear so I have to hunt for them by moving the mouse around the screen every time I want to pause, or skip, or ... WHAT IS THE POINT? (At least I found a way to turn off the disappearing scroll bar in Microsoft Word. One down, one-hundred to go). Please, someone in Development or Design tell me what the benefit is of using disappearing controls?",amazon

Unfortunately, the app forces you to save to the phones (Galaxy3)internal SD card which in my phone does not have sufficient room for my music. The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone. At this time you have two options, root the phone and remap the phones internal SD storage location or copy the music files to the external SD (which breaks playlists).
 
 If Amazon were to fix that one problem I would re-rate the app to 5 stars.",amazon
2/14/2013,"Prior versions of this app were uninspired but functional. The current version is so poorly designed as to be nonfunctional. I've moved back to iTunes. Near as I can make out, the net effect of this app - if not the strategic intent - to make using this app to access downloaded and owned music so inconvenient that you just go to Amazon Unlimited streaming instead.",amazon
4/9/2017,Amazon Music with Prime Music is the best application I have ever seen. Customers receive this application as part of their prime membership. The benefits of this program are worth the price of a prime membership. You can listen to almost every artist for free. The albums and playlists that are free have the prime banner on them and show the price as $0.00. I mention this because you want to be careful as the app sneaks in some suggested albums that cost money. Customers can listen to music ad free!!!! Goodbye to other music apps that have annoying commercials. What are you waiting for? Download Amazon Music with Prime Music today!,amazon
7/19/2014,It is a terribly complicated way to upload and categorize music. If you upload your own music it uses the Artists name as the main indentifier and if there are multiple artists it creates an album for each of them instead of seeing the album as a whole. You can edit but the app is not user friendly in that it requires multiple steps each time you edit an album. Unlike iTunes you cannot edit the entire album information all at one time. It requires you to do that song by song. Terrible. I am not a fan of iTunes but I find it more user friendly then Amazon music.,amazon
11/23/2016,"***THE WORST MUSIC SOFTWARE***
 
 1. Doesn't play the majority of the songs I've uploaded.
 2. Sometimes replaces album art with incorrect ones.
 3. Sometimes deletes lyrics from various songs (not really relevant since the Amazon Music Player doesn't display lyrics, unless that feature is enabled and then you're left with songs without lyrics)
 
 Amazon refuses to play most of my songs that were uploaded to the cloud. These are original mp3 or m4a files. I don't understand what the problem is. Some play, some don't. Why?
 
 I did find a workaround that involves uploading, downloading, and then uploading again. That's right: upload the song, then download it back to your computer, delete the original uploaded song from Amazon's cloud server, and then re-upload the downloaded song. It appears that certain things are delete from the original uploaded, such as lyrics. Maybe Amazon doesn't like certain lyrics? Who knows!!!",amazon
12/6/2016,"As far as the apps for Prime Music, the latest Windows version, latest Android/Chrome versions, and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be. There is no music enhancement such as any kind of editor or EQ. I'd like to see a sophisticated sound normalization and EQ option if possible. The Prime Music uploading app (admittedly a separate app that goes with this one and should actually be rolled into this one) does seem in immediate need of a major refresh as it seems long-winded and clunky to use. It should be much more user-friendly plainly speaking. As for the Prime Music Service itself, well because it's free as a Prime member I'm happy for anything that adds value that I'd actually use and benefit from. That said, Prime Music has a long way to go to be an actual music service anyone would want enough to pay for. Yep, if you're paying your going to want Spotify, Tidal, or Pandora. With these services you don't request to listen to Badfinger and get some nameless cover band ""re-recording"" the song which even if you were four or five cocktails in would sound ridiculous compared to the real song. This is a real serious fault of Prime Music and I'm shocked it's even within acceptable legal limits, i.e. the song says it's ""Day After Day"" by Badfinger but it sounds like an attempt (and often a poor one) to sound like Badfinger...So, how can these songs be represented as THE song by THE band??? Here's the bottom line: If Amazon Prime Music is going to be anything other than a free music service (which Amazon hopes keeps Prime customers re-upping due to value) Amazon is going to have to really get access to a VERY LARGE music catalog and do away with the ""bait and switch"" SOUNDS BAD RE-RECORDINGS. And speaking of sound, the fidelity of actual sources are sometimes noticeably not the best (it's likely the source and not the streaming quality itself), I think Amazon needs to raise the fidelity a noticeable notch too.
 
 I've been critical because I do like the fact I can create a playlist of mostly free songs in the cloud. They can be ones Amazon offers as part of Prime as well as my purchases and uploads. This is the best part and I like it. If Amazon will put some of it's muscle and money behind this service it will be not only for current Prime members but will bring an avalanche of new Prime customers.",amazon
10/19/2015,"At first was excited to find this app to stream my Amazon music library on my mac. That excitement didn't last long. Takes SO long just to navigate through music. Search is slow and then if you do find the artist/song you're lookaying for it displays the album art next to it, NOT the one you selected. Beyond that, takes FOREVER just to play a song. Mostly takes up CPU and spins. I've got a super fast internet connection too, so that's not it.
 
 Sadly I had to go back to the browser just to play my library, and that user interface is even more clunky. And JUST FINDING MY MUSIC LIBRARY was nearly impossible. Easy to find Prime video, prime music, but SO HARD to find my own music I own.
 
 If performance for this app ever did get fixed, it sure would be cool to have an Android app to access and play my library like a remote control. Ever cooler to have an iTunes-like visualizer.",amazon
10/18/2014,"Amazing and fun app to use to discover some new music. I feel like there is still too much crude AI use in selecting music however, and the mediocre music selection/dj'ing can dull the experience.",amazon
7/2/2017,"First: This works fine on my computer, and I like it.
 
 Second, there is a very big ""but"": not only was it gobbling half my battery life with the phone app - all while not being used - that it doesn't do what it must do if it's a phone app. Namely, work on my wifi. I thought that suddenly my the battery on my phone must be weakening. It is not.
 
 In order to download the music that belongs to you or use the player services it provides, you have to allow it to get on your phone's internet . It refuses to use wifi. This is bizarre, but what the hey. I downloaded my purchases and thought everything was fine. Come to find out, I'd used 1GB of data that I didn't even know about. Now, what is that? Then I got busy and forgot to lookay into it. I haven't used the player in the last week, and now my phone service is notifying me that I've used ANOTHER 1 GB of data!?! What in the world is it doing to use that much. Lucky for me I have a big plan, or I'd be paying now.
 
 Amazing. Update: I logged out to stop it (there is no off button and you can't get it to leave your notifications or stand down otherwise), and now it's got a pop up asking me to log in that you can't get out of by pressing the back button. Amazon can forget it. I'm not logging in and out when I want to play music.",amazon
2/9/2016,"This app was never very functional but with the latest update it became unusable. I have 1 account I use for apps and a different account I use with a prime membership. All worked well for me prior to single sign on. When Amazon introduced single sign on, instead of making things easier they made everything more complicated and brokaye things in the process! Initial, after installing the Amazon app store you could sign in using a different user after downloading and installing Prime Music. Trying to sign in with a different user using the Amazon store app did not work. No things are reversed. Sign in with a different user works with the Amazon store app but no longer works with the Prime music app. Amazon, do us all a favor, get rid of your brokayen implementation of &#34;single sign on&#34; please!!!",amazon
8/24/2015,"I am trying to understand the logic behind this ""free music"" app marketed to people who already pay you a $100 per year. Are you completely unaware that we can already stream music for free elsewhere without a subscription of any kind? ""Stored on a cloud"" simply means ""we control all of your access to music you purchased"". I am not going to renew our Prime subscription next year. So far our is just a gateway to additional monthly fees.",amazon
5/30/2017,"Though I like the concept of Amazon music with prime, this app leaves a bit to be desired. Specifically it is really slow. I have around 3000 songs on my Galaxy S7. It can take upwards of a minute to change screens. Once I have reached the album, playlist or artist I am searching for, it plays just fine.",amazon
11/9/2017,"I really like Amazon Music. I've been using it for about 6 months and it's finally starting to become a viable replacement for Spotify and Pandora and whatnot. It doesn't have quite the music selection as its competitors, but it has enough to keep me happy.
 
 At first there were some design flaws that made things a bit confusing, but they've been constantly making small adjustments that have made the whole experience very simple to use.
 
 Also, I'm really happy they've been adding more classic Prog Rock, like Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Yes and some of the newer stuff like Between the Buried and Me, Opeth, The Mars Volta. Can't wait to see more of that and other Prog Rock.The selection keeps getting better every week.
 
 One thing I'd really like to see is a higher bit rate option. I think it'd be a really nice feature, although the music does sound pretty decent as is.
 Also gapless playback, if possible. With alot of prog, songs weren't designed to have a pause between songs; they just keep playing.",amazon

1/3/2016,"I'm fairly computer literate and this is a painful application/service to use. This is especially true if you have a large library to upload to the cloud. I'm talking weeks of babysitting this thing to get them there.
 
 Also, the app is very slow to respond when scrolling around in My Library. There should be a local index so this doesn't happen. Of course, the Store browsing works reasonably well since they only have tiny web pages (a couple of screens long).
 
 This service is a valuable component to the Alexa universe. Pleeeeeze, Get it right. It honestly seems like Amazon really doesn't want you to use your music you already own, in favor of a streaming service. It may be fine for some, but personally, I don't want Amazon feeding me music via streaming. I want MY music. Think about this.... What if your parents told you what was popular and you had to stream from that.",amazon
11/13/2016,"The good:
 No ads
 Large selection overall
 Doesn't cut off the last 15 seconds of music (an issue Pandora has never bothered to fix)
 
 The bad:
 Some genres are rather sparse (in particular heavy metal and alternative)
 pausing songs for more than a couple of minutes causes the app to replay the song from scratch or shut down altogether
 The search function really needs some work. I have had better luck searching in my browser than I have in the app from my phone.
 
 In total, this has become the music app of choice for me.",amazon

However, in the last few months it is constantly freezing after playing only a few songs (offline) and recently in the last few weeks, it will either not launch my library or it will hang up before a song loads to start playing. It is extremely frustrating and I would not consider this app or service when deciding to purchase Amazon Prime, because it is so unreliable.
 If this was a free service, I would expect some issues occasionally. I expect so much better from Amazon. Maybe Wal-Mart or one of the other competitors that Amazon used to dominate will jump in and make an app that just simply works.",amazon

The radio feature is limited to preset stations. There is no continuous playlist option to supplement the active playlist with a radio selection based on the most recent playlist selection.
 
 As far as glitches: When you are lucky enough to find the song you want, and have it be part of the Prime offering, then you have the issue of actually playing the track. Often when trying to add a new song to my library it will indicate it has been added, but then when I go to play the song nothing happens. Sometimes the song will play after a minute or two, but other times you have to exit the application completely and relaunch it to get the new songs to play. This is very frustrating when you simply want to listen to a new song!
 
 And the good stuff: Once you start to play a track there are no hiccups in the audio output. Youd think this would go without saying, but a lot of the steaming services that have web based players dont seem to be able to get this right, including Spotify and Google Music. Having an application on the desktop is one way to assure smooth playback, although some services seem to be able to make good web players that can do this too. Also, the quality of the recordings sounds good to me, with no loss of quality that I could readily notice due to the applied compression.",amazon

 Every time I try to upload new music the darn thing just crashes. This is not the first time Amazon has used their customers to beta test a new product before it is ready for Prime time. When they do that I start mistaking them for Apple Music. I don't know where to even get help or who to e-mail to register a complaint. Grrrrrrrr.",amazon

Then the audio *might* come on, but when it goes to the next track  if it does at all  it's often silent again. Or, it may happily play several tracks, and then crap out again. Needless to say, this ""free"" service for Prime members is as they say, what you pay for. I'm going to give Apply Music a try when it's released.",amazon

No.. okay back to home screen, No, I don't know ! I'll close the app and listen to radio or CD on the drive home.

 1) 99% of the time, I use Amazon MP3 to play my Amazon Cloud songs. I generally list items by Album. Well, when I finish listening to an album, go back to the album list and try to play another, it NEVER works. It just hangs. So every time I'm done with an album, I have to completely close and re-open the program. This is extremely frustrating, especially when listening to complilations because....
 
 2) Compilations are not grouped under one album. Every single song lists the exact same album name, yet Amazon MP3 creates a separate album for every artist. So you can't just click on an comp and let it play. You have to go back and choose a new song every time, which is maddening when you consider problem #1 above. I'm guessing Amazon would respond that there's something in the metadata that doesn't flag it as a comp, but come on. If I'm in album view, just combine the albums with the same name.",amazon
5/31/2014,Decent service. Love the fact that it's bundled w/ Prime. Makes Primes an even greater bargain! The service itself is.... useable... The music selection is not as vast as other services and the audio quality for some reason is only so-so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline those are must have for any music streaming services. Hopefully artists and content will increase with time.

12/16/2012,"I was one of the early Prime subscribers, and generally am more than pleased by Amazon, their products and services, and usually have nothing bad to say about Amazon....
 However, that having been said, while I do enjoy Amazon Prime Music (APM) I am forced to uninstall it. It is a HUGE, space-consuming app! Let me elaborate: I've had this smart phone for just barely over a year. I don't download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l. APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly, in one of the folders within APM, I found numerous folders with names such as [500] and [47] and [200], etc. Within EACH of these numerous folders, I found the EXACT same images of album covers, (many/most of which I never played, viewed, downloaded, etc. - most were from the &#34;Recommended for you&#34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon, and the other suggestions, etc.,made by Amazon) Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images & data, there's apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary (space-destroying!) data! Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images & data, the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96[GIGABYTES!] -let me make this perfectly clear here, that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes, NOT Megabytes!! WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS & PLAYS MUSIC &#60;need&#62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!? This is absolutely RIDICULOUS, I *HOPE* someone at Amazon is reading this and lookaying into this...
 With APM installed, I was constantly receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work. That was correct, I missed phone calls, could not receive texts, etc., and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed. This includes my Android system OS, obviously, and virus/malware protection updates, ... and, just to be clear, this overwhelming space-consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files, and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!! Completely unacceptable, thus it gone, uninstalled. When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones (which are NOT huge space-storage devices, to begin with!), I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!",amazon
8/14/2015,"I am used to listen music in itunes radio or from my itunes library.
 But in Android I had very limited possibilities to listen music, I ignore if I had bad luck with apps for Andrid or they lack of good music apps for Android, but this, the Amazon app is a very good app for downloading your own purchased and free music! I now can listen good music in my Android cellphone too. (I own Prime membership, so I wonder everyone can have free music without it).",amazon
7/27/2014,"The cool thing about the MP3 app is the Cloud service and the store has some of the music I listen to, is relatively cheaper than iTunes. Cloud service is cool. I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)
 
 Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix.",amazon

1/18/2013,"I really wasn't sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it's just okay since the app is not all that bad (lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet) and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I'd have to stay with 3 stars.
 
 Issue #1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I couldn't move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can't play any prime music, but that's okay because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.
 
 Issue #2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that didn't make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I'm sure there are many more. Disappointing.",amazon
10/14/2014,Since the most recent update this app has become unusable and useless. As soon as you open the app it freezes and causes a forced close. It is so bad that it makes Google's MP3 music player lookay like geniuses created it. Please fix this payer or make the previous version available until you fix this horrible app.,amazon
9/1/2014,"The Mac version of Amazon Music Player is garbage, pure and simple. I can't speak for the Windows version, but the Mac version frequently (read: almost always) hangs for LONG periods of time before showing tracks in any section of the player. It also appears to use a lot of resources - I see system-wide issues while using Music Player, but when I completely close out of it, OS X goes back to behaving like it should. Now that we're forced to use this player to download any music we've added to Amazon Music, I've gone from merely irritated to absolutely angry. It is AWFUL software, and after several years dealing with quirks and outright problems with Amazon Music, I really wonder if Amazon will EVER get this working correctly.
 
 Other ""fun"" issues:
 
 Badly matched songs (completely the wrong recordings - we're talking live songs being replaced by studio versions!) You can attempt to correct the match, but I have yet to get this to work well.
 
 MISSING songs! Inexplicably, some songs are just GONE from my library. Totally random - most albums are fine, others are missing this or that song, or maybe a couple. Infuriating.
 
 Tag editor destroys existing ID3 tags: if you dare edit any info in the file(s) you've uploaded, you will be rewarded with a downloadable version that has completely stripped out ALL tags. You won't know what song is what. ALL tags are empty, so there will be no artist to go by, no track name, no track number, no album name. NOTHING. This sounds completely unacceptable were it not for the need to rarely do this, but what makes it truly completely unacceptable is the fact that tracks in your library may randomly have their ID3 tags altered by either the uploader, whatever software runs on Amazon's servers, or the Music Player. And you're screwed at that point.
 
 Other than that, it's GREAT.",amazon

 However, it works as intended (which is not to say smoothly) on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. My opinion has greatly improved since upgrading, but there is still a ballroom left for improvement...
 
 THE GOOD:
 *Prime Music - ""Free"" with Prime, I didn't have that feature when I subscribed, so it's a plus. I've found around 10 albums on Prime that I didn't already have, so I can listen for ""Free"" and see if I want to buy them permanently.
 *I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone.
 *Download for listening offline is great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without using data, perfect! Better than Pandora. This IS about the only positive point of the actual App...
 
 THE BAD:
 *Downloading/finding my purchased Amazon music is much harder than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music, but I don't see a way to do that.
 *Storage of offline listening music can't be moved, no option for it...
 *Doesn't resume play once app is shut down. This makes it a terrible music player. I don't really want the app running all the time, but that means I need to remember where I left off... This alone is worth 1 star.
 *I don't seem to be able to hide anything from it... I listen to one type of music, but I need to purchase other music here and there. I don't want that cluttering things up, but I am astounded at the lack of options in this app...

5/21/2017,"I like this app for the most part.I have used the PC version for Windows, the iPad app, and the Android app for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Over all it performs well enough, but i do have a few gripes about it.
 
 First complaint is where is the version for the Fire TV? I'm using the app on an Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft device, but Amazon hasn't got a version yet for their own device?? I keep hearing soon, but soon is never soon enough!
 
 My next complaint is with editing songs/albums you have uploaded to the cloud. As with the Amazon MP3 app that this app replaced there is no way to edit album art. I have over 15,000 songs uploaded to the Amazon Cloud Player and a number of them don't have the correct album cover art. Some have no album art at all even though all my songs/albums have a high quality image embedded in the MP3 file itself. If the mobile apps can't do this so be it, but you should at least be able to copy/paste your own album art on a PC or Mac similar to Google Play Music , iTunes, etc.
 
 I also cant seem to stream any music via 3G/4G without constant buffering, so i have to make sure I remember to download music via Wi-Fi before leaving the house. I don't believe this is a limitation of the app, but has more to do with my cell carrier (Sprint) in my area. I also can't stream from Spotify either so it's more of a network issue.
 
 I also don't like the fact that you have to add anything you want to play for the Prime Music selection to your library before you can play it. I use services like Spotify, Slacker, and Amazon Music to discover bands as well as play music I already know, so I don't want to add music to my library that I might not even like. We should be able to play the music and then add to our personal library if it turns out you like it.
 
 Otherwise I think its a good app with much potential. The GUI is nice enough and easy to use. I expect Amazon, with their deep pockets, to sign more music labels and make more music available for Prime members in the future, but the selection isn't bad considering Prime Music just launched about 3 weeks ago. Still has a ways to go to reach Spotify's catalog of songs/artists/albums.",amazon

 Since I've had the app, I spent a lot of time setting my playlists. Then you update and bam, playlists are empty. I've done that multiple times. If you all don't do something I'm going to migrate to a different company. I don't want to, but as another reviewer said, you have to try hard to make an app this bad.",amazon
4/3/2017,"I just started using because it was in my Prime membership. So, why not - right?
 
 It surprised me in a good way! The app has been updated, so it runs pretty smoothly in Android. It has a decent quality in streaming, but I recommend downloading and playing offline your favorite music. The audio quality will be top!
 
 The desktop app is basically Spotify with an Amazon skin. So, you know what to expect.
 
 Unfortunately, my cars don't have a link to this app, so I only have basic controls over Bluetooth - which is not bad at least, but not perfect. However, nothing that makes me stop using it.
 
 If you're Prime, this is a must use!",amazon
6/21/2016,"So - last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. (Seriously? Google?) (I expect it from Microsoft - every MS Windows-based music player I have ever touched has been below lame.) I didn't care for Pandora - I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.
 
 So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say ""Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it's MP3 then store it all here!!"" SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.
 
 I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that won't ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes - and on an old iPod Photo 60G. (The 4g iPod still lives - but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom.) So over the next few weekends I open the laptop, start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. (A Samsung Charge on Verizon - a nice phone - good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill - ""City ID"" is one that is $2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!)
 
 After a month I was all done.
 
 Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs (250 - how laughable! NOT!) ... unless I pay $24.95 a year?
 
 Even though the price is reasonable - I still feel like - for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year, 5Gigs is free - I used my allotment and no more. When they said ""It's free!"" I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.
 
 Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization -- so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers - where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind - to the tune of $25 bucks a year just months later?
 
 And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. (I only traveled 25K miles last month, go figure!!) Now I have to re-rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I've got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic-appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.
 
 I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out - M-A-D-MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.
 
 If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive - where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT - I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot ""download"" an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap - promise. I am just that mad.
 
 Two other complaints: I use a netbookay most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The ""Artist"" column can not be expanded for example. You can't sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: ""display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues"" -- but yea, now my playlists are gone unless I fork over $24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn-tooting be nicely functional okay?
 
 Last - the Droid App tookay over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still -- to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a ""you must agree to this"" message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean, I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen tookay over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen tookay over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen tookay over. At that point in time I deleted this app, the Amazon Marketplace app, the Amazon Price Checker app, the Amazon Student app, The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.
 
 Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.

6/8/2016,"The layout is not user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion.
 This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles.
 Fine, but I feel like I've lost a useful app in the revision.
 
 In the previous app version: it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising (listening whilst in motion).
 You now have to stop, go to additional screens (with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards!), & take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions (get playlist on device, shuffle, repeat song, etc.).
 Unacceptable from both a safety (car) &/or usability standpoint (exercise).
 
 When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile (eg: hear a song in a store that you like)- it STILL loads it to the internal memory. (!!!)
 My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.
 
 Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.
 Great if you're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.
 
 The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.
 (This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is).
 
 Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.
 OH....SOoooo not happy about that.
 I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I (now know that I) should have backed them up.
 I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists (not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc.).
 Am not happy about this.
 
 I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.
 (I don't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi).
 When I'm on a road trip- it's my bandwidth that's used if so.
 I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I don't need to use bandwidth to listen.
 Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.
 If I'm at home, fine.
  But it simply doesn't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.
 What do I gain here by using this app?
 Whatever I do gain- it's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.
 Amazon's late to the game on this.

6/17/2014,"Not bad, but too commercial - oriented toward selling tracks & albums. Just no way I'm gonna pay a buck or so for digital music downloads. Also not user-friendly for me. I give three stars rather than two because it's free (for Prime members).
 Going back to Rhapsody.",amazon
10/28/2014,"It's a nice app, but there's not a ton to do with it, which is fine because you're just listening to music. One handy feature is the ability to listen to music stored on the device itself without having to use a separate app. All in all, nothing bad to say.",amazon
4/13/2013,"I have purchased 894 songs from 146 albums. When I purchase new music it is simply impossible to tell what has already been downloaded. ""Drag music here to download?"" WHAT??? This is a computer for crying out loud. Can't you TELL ME what hasn't already been downloaded? Present me with a list? DOWNLOAD ALL???
 
 Drag to a list to download? I WANT IT ALL OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT!!!
 
 Amazon music is the worst program I have EVER run into, and I have been in computers since 1972. THE WORST I have ever run into!
 
 It appears that they want us to leave everything on the cloud, make play lists and stream it off the cloud. The problem with that is that mostly I send it to my tablets and my phone, which I then listen to in my car or out in public. The tablets only ever have an internet connection in my house. My phone has to pay BIG BUCKS for data to stream music I already own.
 
 Streaming may work just fine sitting at my desk in my home over a broadband, but it just doesn't work AT ALL out in the world. I need to download to my devices. ALL OF THEM! All my music.
 
 Let me repeat, AMAZON MUSIC is the WORST program I have EVER RUN INTO. And I have run into some reaaaaaalllly bad crap.
 
 Sadly, Amazon doesn't care, nor do they read these comments, so this is just an exercise in expressing my frustration.
 
 Buying the music is dead simple, and I like to support the artists, and listen to the music I love. Buy getting it to my devices.
 
 WOOF, what nightmare!!!",amazon
1/16/2015,"I like Amazons cloud and being able to upload (for free) your own music and download it on any device. While it wasnt my go to music app, because it was limited, it still did what it did very well.
 
 With the addition of free music for prime members how ever it feels that the weakness of the app's design has appeared. Prime members get a mix of; bad, okay, excellent choices of free music to choose from. Im a progressive house/trance fan so my selection is super limited. Im not one for modern day pop music.
 
 I know millions of people are okayay hearing a song for the 30th time on the radio and for some reason add it to their playlist for more future listening. But I dont like that type of music. So I must depend on browsing for music. Prime music makes it really hard because the music I KNOW I want to hear isnt free so I wish Prime can introduce me to music I may want to hear that is available to prime members. Currently the only way to introduce listeners to new music is by listening to other peoples play list. Which so far I have found nothing I fully enjoy. And it seems you cant manipulate the playlist that easily. The user interface makes it difficult to add/delete music. Is the music I downloaded on my phone via a playlist totally tied to just that playlist or is it in my music library?
 
 *In addition I found that even searching for music even with knowing an artist makes finding prime music a pain. While typing in an artist on my PC (which by the way you can only sample songs when using amazon.com but you can search, meanwhile amazons music program lets you play a full song added to your library but you can search for songs outside of your library) I found that not all the songs for prime were listed when typing in the artists name. I had to type in the song individually to get that result.
 
 All in all it is a smooth start for Prime. Very little bugs.
 
 Pros:
 Not laggy and no bugs yet
 Free Music
 Great launch for Prime
 Pop music for the masses.
 
 Cons:
 Hodge podge of song selections makes finding music you want to listen to more annoying.
 Music discovery is dependent on other peoples playlist. No I dont want to listen to Nicky Romero, Pitbull, and Armin all at once. Please add an intelligent radio program so to help you find music that fits your taste
 UI is bit difficult and getting to the songs you want to listen to a bit tedious. Too much clicking
 add/delete songs from playlists is confusing",amazon
6/19/2014,Why did they break my Amazon Music app??? i had playlists set up and I didn't have to have an inet connection to listen...now they are gone and I'm not able to find any of my music playlists or music I had downloaded!! Dug out my old sandisk and using that again. Bad move Amazon! I won't use iTunes so now I'm in search of a different provider. great job - you just lost a customer.,amazon
7/1/2014,"Amazon needs to make some major improvements to their Amazon Music App on the Kindle Fire series. It does not work well offline (appears the buffer memory is way too small). Besides not working well offline, you have to actually tell the Kindle Fire device to work offline and then tell it again to work online... How stupid is that? Can't Amazon's own app on it's own name brand device figure out if it is connected to WiFi or not and function accordingly? I love the Amazon Music service concept, but the Amazon Music App currently is so sub-par. In addition, when the Amazon Music App crashes, you literally have to reboot by turning off the Fire and then turning it back on again. On both my Apple and other Android-based devices, in the rare instance that an app does crash, you can wait a few seconds and then just re-launch it. Not so with Amazon Music. To shame!
 
 Also, it appears that the Amazon Music App has functionality issues with reading/writing music files on large memory cards. I have had Amazon Music crash and then my Fire HD 8 suddenly can't read my name-brand 64GB SDHC card after the Amazon Music App crashed. I've had this behavior happen many times... Then it takes a series of reboots to get it to properly read the memory card (and apps loaded on it which are all grayed out on the screen) again. And then the Fire HD 8 and all apps and media on the memory card will work just fine for days, usually as long as Amazon Music App doesn't crash out again!!! So that tells me it's not a bad memory card at all... Somethings wrong with Amazon's app / device.
 
 Overall, the Fire HD 8 Tablet seems to be an excellent low-priced tablet, but the Amazon Music App and phantom memory card error issues are killing it for me. Amazon, you're better than this, right? Get your device and app teams to fix this or I'm moving to Spotify and likely never coming back!",amazon
12/1/2016,"Mediocre at best. The prime music stations are utterly lacking in descriptive information. You are forced to try one-- and if it's absolutely horrible to you? Too bad-- the stupid app thinks you *liked* it, even if you only listened to the first few seconds of each song, before clicking ""no"".. and after 3 or 5? You realize that station is not for you.
 
 But. The app *now* thinks you LIKE that sort of crap-- and offers more of the same dreck! Horrible!
 
 A simple description under each station is too much to ask? Or even just a category label? No? As if I'm supposed to recognize these people (after which the station is named... right)?
 
 I'd love to learn about new artists-- but not at the risk of opening a station that absolutely sets my teeth on edge (i.e. ""cow hard country""... makes me ill).
 
 Where is a FILTER for the prime stations? I don't care what is popular! I just wish to eliminate musical styles I find objectionable-- but there is no way to do this in this app.
 
 One star, all but useless.",amazon
2/24/2016,"You buy music with this app, but you can't play it on any of your new devices. It's the worst. It doesn't let you play it because you have to deregister your old devices on Amazon.com from a web browser. But you have no way to register a new device. So Amazon Music will give an error called ""Ah fiddlesticks"" which means... awe, our music software can't play the music you paid for on your new smartphone.
 
 Oh and then, it says that you have to buy a Kindle or something like that in order to register your new device. What kind of non-sense is that?

6/21/2017,"This app only does a few things, it's basically a music player with a built-in store. Being someone who uses Amazon Cloud Player, I expected this to work like a breeze but there are all kinds of problems.
 
 The main one is that across both this app and the Cloud Player, Amazon have a pathological problem with track ordering and identifying albums which has STILL not been fixed. Talk about keeping the main thing, the main thing, I can't imagine how they can't fix it. Uploading tracks from iTunes to Cloud Player lose their track ordering because some of them get the year and disc number and some don't. Album artwork that is taken from a completely different album even though the tracks I've uploaded all have the correct tagging. I thought this was perhaps a Cloud Player issue but...
 
 ...nope. This app seems to have the same problems. Take Presto, an album by Rush which I uploaded from iTunes. It brokaye like most albums did so I had to reset the tags in Cloud Player to make the track listings work and now they are correct. I recently bought a new phone and got this app, downloaded Presto from Cloud Player and....the app thinks it is two different albums so now if I want to play the whole album, I can't without creating a playlist. One of them is listed as Presto with the srtwork from Presto and has 3 songs on it and the other is also listed as Presto but with the artwork from Chronicles with the other 8 songs on it.
 
 How on earth have Amazon mucked this up so badly? They are supposed to be kings of online sales and probably sell a large percentage of the online music market but this is basic cock up 101. The fact it has not been fixed? Fail The fact that this occurs on two products? Fail The fact that it happens on the app even when the tracks are supposedly downloaded from Cloud Player which is setup correctly? Fail The fact you can't even force the music on the app to go to the correct place? Fail The fact that the app thinks that Presto by Rush and Presto by Rush are two different albums? Fail.
 
 Also, the tracks sometimes reset back to the beginning when playing.
 
 The only reason I don't move to another service is that iTunes and Google Music don't sound much better. There is NOTHING actually keeping me with Amazon other than that.",amazon
5/17/2014,"UNBELIVEABLE! The Amazon Music App will not install on my 2015 Amazon Fire tablet or original Fire TV! When I try the Amazon product page says it's not compatible. Argh!
 
 The product listing says it only requires Android 4.1 and both my Fire tablets and Fire TV have been updated to have OS versions based on Android 4.1 or newer. I'm blocked from even purchasing it (at $0 of course). Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for!
 
 Maybe I shouldn't complain as the old app works fine for me. On the other hand a lot of good music seems to be disappearing from Prime music and I expect the added cost music subscription may be needed in the future to get good tunes. Just feeling a little dark at a good thing like prime being eaten away in parts I care about.

 I no longer have to go to YouTube and listen to less quality music while keeping my phone open so YouTube works. Every song I want is in this.
 The annual fee isn't bad at all for not having to worry about paying every month, or not finding your song, or listening to ads. It's really a small price.
 Plus, I didn't find that they removed songs or at least that many songs from their prime anyway.

If your previously owned music is on an external SD card and you add the same music to Amazon Prime music cloud it will see your previously owned music as ""downloaded from Amazon"" yet expired thus unable to play it.

For such a big company with such a big music footprint I'm shocked at how bad this app is. Seems the bigger the company the worse the app! Sad cause I really like Amazon Prime but their apps are terrible!",amazon
11/1/2017,"I wanted to chime in on Amazon Prime Music. I have been using this service for about a year and a half now. I absolutely love the easy access to my music collection whether I am on the internet at work, out in the world with my phone, chilling with my tablet, or enjoying music through the home surround sound Prime Music is ready to go and streams well!
 
 However! I am a serious music collector and I adore having my collection labeled correctly, correct album art, and organised by year of release. Not too much to ask, these are STANDARD music program features since the first Windows Media Player and iTunes....
 
 Well you can not change your album art in Amazon Prime Music! In the year 2015 and after years of complaints in the forums you still cannot do this. Yes, there are bogus work arounds like finding the artwork cache on your PC and pasting new arrowroot in there with the same file name as the bad artwork. However this only affects your PC amazon music player, it does not change on your tablet, phone, website etc. Then there is the method of downloading your album back to your PC, adding it to a better music player, using that music players artwork change feature, and then import it back to Amazon Prime Music which may or may not take it or just paste the wrong artwork on it again! Either way this is ridiculous and for a serious music collection this will take YEARS to correct my collection to my standards. So yeah, this is a MAJOR issue for me that really bugs me. Albums will have the wrong artwork, sometimes 3 albums in a row have the same wrong artwork, and many just don't have artwork at all.
 
 You also are very limited in how you can view your music, no option for sorting or display release years which is another big issue for me. The program also displays your music very literally by artist instead of album artist. What does this mean? Well instead of displaying lets say all of Beyonce's music under one artist heading of Beyonce, Amazon will have 30+ Beyonce artists, one for every Feat she has ever done. The only way to condense this is to change the artist to Beyonce and lose the information on who she is singing with. This is soooooo frustrating!!
 
 When it really comes down to it if i had a better option i would absolutely ditch Prime Music because it is just far too simplistic and limited for my tastes but when you already have a Prime account the price is just too sweet to ignore along with Amazon's fantastic storage limit and bonus features etc. and like i said before, having all your music everywhere and anywhere is pretty awesome! Overall i do like the service but there are just unacceptable issues that frustrate on a daily basis and after over 3 years of this program existing im just left scratching my head at how a giant like Amazon does not fix these issues.... I want to love it Amazon! And it is so easy to fix it so just do it already! I will only hang on so much longer that's for sure!",amazon
7/17/2015,I tried to get this app to run on my Lenovo Tab and installed it multiple times and all it does is crash. To bad as I wanted to use it with my Prime account. But can't get it to work. Guess I'll use Google play instead. But that means I need to download my songs to my SD card.,amazon
1/4/2017,"This thing is bad. I've used several others and this is by far at the bottom, which surprised me coming from Amazon. The way you upload a big library like I have to the cloud is atrocious. I have been trying for days to get my approximately 120GB's (and that isn't even that big of a library), up for days. On top of that, they should have an option to point to your music folder and keep track of your personal library and sync your library with your cloud, so its always up to date.

3/29/2017,"Yesterday the Amazon mp3 app on my phone updated and went from a great app to one of the worst I've ever used. It's very frustrating because I can no longer save music to my sd card, the app has crashed several times, and I am getting a lot of download error messages. It is bad enough that I am considering going tomorrow and buying an IPhone and never buying music from Amazon again. Also a better Prime benefit would have been unlimited cloud drive storage for music rather than a million songs that just take up the very limited storage space on my phone or kill the battery if I try to stream it. It also would be a very good idea to make it available to use on the kindle fire and Fire TV.",amazon
6/16/2014,"I hate typing bad reviews, but maybe Amazon may listen. I have been using the Amazon Music app on my computer for a few years, so I have experience with it. I am also a Web Developer, so I know how to use a computer. When the latest updates for this app arrived, I was immediately put off. If all you do is play music, it works fine. Uploads are not intuitive at all.
 
 In the older version, when you wanted to upload music, you added it by choosing a file/folder with a browser, or you dragged files/folders onto the app. Then, you saw the list of songs with an uploading icon next to the ones in queue, and the finished ones indicated as such. After uploading, you could clear the queue, so the next time you upload something, you could see exactly what was happening.
 
 Now, you drag files/folders onto the app, as before, but only the songs that are actively uploading or finished are displayed. Unless you counted, you have no idea how many are left to upload. They only get added as they upload. And the queue list shows everything you have ever uploaded, so if I want to see what is in progress, I have to find it in the list. I have thousands of songs. Unless I search for the songs that are uploading, I have no idea it is even working.
 
 This app would be much more useful for me if it would bring back the old upload method. Everything else is not bad.",amazon

12/15/2014,"UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.
 
 Original Review:
 No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)
 
 What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.
 
 Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.
 
 Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.
 
 As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.
 
 Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional.",amazon
4/26/2012,"I have used the ""other"" Mp3 player for years and never liked it. It tookay up too much room in my devices and is unique to it's own products. I am a freedom loving person and the Cloud player let's me be free. I can buy from many sources and the best part is it doesn't eat up any space on my electronics. The sound quality is superb. Ease of use excellent. When I had a problem today I talked to a specialist in 3 minutes. He tookay me thru a little tutorial and now I know a lot more than I did before. The streaming has been uninterrupted.
 
 It is an easier, friendlier option to the other one and I am very happy to let Amazon store my music until I want to hear it. I have nothing bad to say about it. If you are new to Mp3 music streaming, I recommend, without hesitation, that you start here. I
 
 I have read the bad reviews and I am sorry to hear people have had trouble with it. My experience has been excellent with all of my devices. Perhaps they have finally worked a lot of the bugs out of it. Anybody who has used Facebookay knows about software bugs! Maybe my expectations weren't high. But my experience with Amazon and The Cloud player system overall has been better than most companies I deal with. As I said, I would recommend it to everyone!",amazon
12/10/2012,"UPDATE:
 
 I find that I use this app less and less. I think the most annoying part is that it ALWAYS tries to sync to your cloud library as soon as you launch it. On the surface, this isn't a bad thing. But the problem is when you don't have solid data coverage or wifi, like in a tunnel or in a building with thick walls. As it tries to sync, the app freezes and you can't do anything but force close it.
 
 Ideally, there should be an option to sync only on wifi or manually by pressing a button. I have several albums downloaded/cached locally and never stream. So the app should just play those local albums and forget about trying to sync any other songs I have in the cloud. Sheesh.
 
 ___________
 I downloaded this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. It's actually not a bad app, even if you don't have Prime or don't purchase music. It recognizes/plays non-DRM music that's already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple, responsive, and not annoying. I like it a little more than the Google Music app. And it's much better than all those free apps that either have limited features or annoying ads, unless you pay up.
 
 I'll also echo my complaint here about not being able to store Prime/purchased music on the SD card. It's really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card, but not any of the music. In a perfect world, we'd have unlimited/reliable mobile data everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality is, we still need to download/cache locally to our mobile devices. Hopefully, Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchased music on the SD card.",amazon
6/29/2014,"The page needs to be refreshed a lot- an issue never experienced with spotify. It's not as bad as youtube where for each video/song you need to click on the tab/window again. (Then again youtube can be used for free.)
 
 Aside from random pausing of music, there is a decent selection of music- some artists I wasn't expecting them to have. Although, many artists are not available and very few are available with a full album collection.
 
 It works for me since I already have prime, which is well worth it for how much I order. I'd give it 4 stars without the streaming errors and 5 with a better selection.",amazon
3/5/2017,"Before I even checked out the native apps on my new phone, I went to the Amazon store to download this app (along with others previously purchased). I never got past the permissions screen- could not believe how intrusive they have made this app! So I didn't accept the terms, went back and read the reviews. There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory (not the memory card), as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone. Sorry Amazon- I will miss being able to download music directly to my phone from Amazon purchases- but not enough to use your app.",amazon
3/27/2014,"As far as the apps for Prime Music, the latest Windows version, latest Android/Chrome versions, and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be. There is no music enhancement such as any kind of editor or EQ. I'd like to see a sophisticated sound normalization and EQ option if possible. The Prime Music uploading app (admittedly a separate app that goes with this one and should actually be rolled into this one) does seem in immediate need of a major refresh as it seems long-winded and clunky to use. It should be much more user-friendly plainly speaking. As for the Prime Music Service itself, well because it's free as a Prime member I'm happy for anything that adds value that I'd actually use and benefit from. That said, Prime Music has a long way to go to be an actual music service anyone would want enough to pay for. Yep, if you're paying your going to want Spotify, Tidal, or Pandora. With these services you don't request to listen to Badfinger and get some nameless cover band ""re-recording"" the song which even if you were four or five cocktails in would sound ridiculous compared to the real song. This is a real serious fault of Prime Music and I'm shocked it's even within acceptable legal limits, i.e. the song says it's ""Day After Day"" by Badfinger but it sounds like an attempt (and often a poor one) to sound like Badfinger...So, how can these songs be represented as THE song by THE band??? Here's the bottom line: If Amazon Prime Music is going to be anything other than a free music service (which Amazon hopes keeps Prime customers re-upping due to value) Amazon is going to have to really get access to a VERY LARGE music catalog and do away with the ""bait and switch"" SOUNDS BAD RE-RECORDINGS. And speaking of sound, the fidelity of actual sources are sometimes noticeably not the best (it's likely the source and not the streaming quality itself), I think Amazon needs to raise the fidelity a noticeable notch too.
 
 I've been critical because I do like the fact I can create a playlist of mostly free songs in the cloud. They can be ones Amazon offers as part of Prime as well as my purchases and uploads. This is the best part and I like it. If Amazon will put some of it's muscle and money behind this service it will be not only for current Prime members but will bring an avalanche of new Prime customers.",amazon

 No ads
 Large selection overall
 Doesn't cut off the last 15 seconds of music (an issue Pandora has never bothered to fix)
 
 The bad:
 Some genres are rather sparse (in particular heavy metal and alternative)
 pausing songs for more than a couple of minutes causes the app to replay the song from scratch or shut down altogether
 The search function really needs some work. I have had better luck searching in my browser than I have in the app from my phone.
 
 In total, this has become the music app of choice for me.",amazon
9/21/2015,"For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment. First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality. This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you. Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time. Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am positive that you could develop whatever you want. I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with. Very dissapointed. Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else. Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy. Good luck with your new fire products. Lookays like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever. You are trying to crush Google, but pushing people to them. You could have owned the entire android ecosystem pretty much with prime music and video and apps.",amazon

It can just play from my phone. I like that part. I have downloaded the music that I purchased and created an album to play my music through for the party so it's easily accessible and ready for use.

 Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).
 
 Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.
 
 Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one. That also means no more, ""which device is that song on?""!

I believe this is the lowest scummy sort of pressure to try to make customers switch to the paid service. Tell you what.

 So, a little frustrated, I'll start driving. It couldn't take that long could it?
 
 Sometimes it'll come up after maybe 5 minutes or so. Other times- 15 minutes down the road- The screen still hasn't popped up.
 
 Usually. After reaching my destination, I'll close all screens on my phone log then reopen the program and everything is cool.
 I do not know about programing, though I know I have a higher end phone, so I can't say 100% who's at fault here- but from the lookays of it- others have the same problem with this app.
 
 Anyhow. I'll likely keep using it. I've been roped in with prime- this is basically free- only a few bucks a month- and I can listen to albums after whatever procedures I've come across.

11/11/2017,"Today, i've updated the Windows Version of the Amazon Music Software to Rel. 5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400. Because the in software upgrade option didn't work (the update didn't finish / it tookay forever), I had to remove it manually via Control Center, downloaded the new version and installed it manually. After first start the login screen locked quite crappy, pictures missing, poor contrast, poor dialog layout. However, i've managed to login.
 In the new software within the thumbnail view, about 60% of the pictures are missing (hate that). If i click some artist and change back to the my music overview the software constantly changes from thumbnail view to list view (really hate that). If i click to prelisten a track in the shop, i'm always getting a message ""a problem has occured"" while everything seems to be working as expected, always have to close this error message before i can select the next track (very very annoying). In the programm settings, i've deselected Auto. Music Import several times now, but Auto Music Import from folder always reactivates itself automagically (why is this option there, if i'm not supposed to change it?). The whole new software feels very laggy in contrast to the old software, although i've got the fastest PC hardware money can buy these days.
 While i like the Prime service in general (especially free shipment and video) and while i like the prime music idea and having a backup copy of all my music tracks in amazon's cloud, this piece of crappy low budget software makes me reconsider my cloud music backup strategy. And it makes me hate amazon, at least for the next few days. The android app is not much better. I'm going to uninstall both and stick with Spotify and large Micro SD cards in my DAC and my phone.
 I hope the people at amazon start using their software themselves, try it out!!! Really hoping that amazon music software is going to be fixed soon. At least to a level that doesn't piss the user off, within the fist 10 minutes of use! Hate it, when service providers waste my time!",amazon
11/6/2016,"This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone. The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam.

3/11/2014,"I've used several different streaming music apps. Some tried forcing me to upgrade to get rid of ads and others won't force you but the ads are inserted in at ridiculous frequency! I downloaded this to try the no ads steaming with Prime.
 
 I like it! It's really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever. I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels. Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!
 
 The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora. Other than that, I like this app, I can pause, skip and shuffle. It definitely helps my day pass faster when I can listen to music I like while I'm working.",amazon
12/16/2015,"I don't understand how this app doesn't have all 5 star ratings. There is nothing it could possibly do better. I've stopped using Pandora altogether. Absolutely a must download for any Prime member.
 
 UPDATE: After using this app for several months now, I am still in love with it. The navigation is pretty simple and doesn't require re-thinking all the time. Lyrics display if you want them to, which is a cool feature I've not seen anywhere else. Album art, great selection, the same stuff doesn't play over and over again, it's just great. Also, I haven't noticed an abundance of live albums which always bugged me on Pandora. I don't want to listen to live recordings, I want the studio release! If you love live music and hate studio stuff, I suppose that's an issue.
 
 I continue to add to my library constantly and this is just the #1 music app in my opinion.

3/24/2014,"I'd been satisfied using the old Amazon MP3 app for some time on my Galaxy S3 and was recently steered into this new ""upgrade"". I don't have Prime so I'm not at all interested in the new Prime features. In practice, I like to download my Amazon MP3 purchases to my phone's micro-SD card so I can play them anywhere without needing to use a network though this has always been a bit more involved than necessary since the old and new app have no option for selecting a different download storage device than my phone's ever shrinking built-in memory.
 
 I have to say the latest version - Amazon Music with Prime Music V4.0.4 - is quite disappointing. When I open the app to download new songs, it immediately displays a message that it is loading cloud songs before I even do anything. It is not clear why the app needs to load cloud songs or why this is taking so long because I have automatic downloads turned off in the app. Whatever the app is doing, it appears to slow the responsiveness dramatically. I then open my Amazon MP3 Library Recently Added list and tap the download icon. It can take a good 10 seconds or more before the app responds and begins downloading. Downloading appears to be much slower than in the old (non-Prime) version over WiFi. And downloading is extremely unreliable -- about one third of my new MP3 fail to download for an unspecified reason. After the list download ends, the app displays a red X next to the Recently Added list which can be pressed to retry downloading. This NEVER seems to work so I often have to scroll through the list of new songs manually, find each failed download and retry each song individually. This works for some songs but, for others, I have to cancel the download and then start a new download for it. During all of this, the app is excessively slow so it takes a while to determine if the app is going to actually retry downloading any particular song. And sometimes the slow response causes the app to switch modes and PLAY the song instead of popping up the retry menu for the song. There's no way to select a group of songs and then retry downloading, each song must be retried individually. After I eventually get all my songs downloaded to the phone, then I have to manually move them to the micro-SD card. Suffice it to say that this entire process is slow, painful and extremely frustrating. It is actually would be much easier and faster to remove the micro-SD from my phone and use my laptop to download my new Amazon MP3s directly to it. The only bright point in all this is that the app now seems to know which songs its already downloaded to my phone (the old version of the app would download songs and albums again and again and rename the files each time so it wasn't easy weed out the duplicates).
 
 Frankly, buying MP3s from Amazon and getting them on my phone has become much too time consuming and frustrating.

8/2/2014,"I use the Amazon Music app to manage all of the music that I download from the Amazon music store. I do this without ever subscribing to Amazons music service, which is something I have tried and don't particularly like. (All of my digital music from Amazon is either Prime or purchased.)
 
 I have installed Amazon Music on all my Android devices except for, ironically, my Kindle Fire HD7  which has all of the Amazon Music features already baked in to its software. I find the Amazon Music app very useful for my purposes, especially now that its interface has been redesigned. I can sort my downloaded music almost any way I wish  by genre, song, album, artist, whether its Prime music or music Ive purchased.
 
 I also have Amazon Music for PC, so whenever I purchase an album or song, it automatically downloads to whatever device I happen to use to make my purchase. Amazon Music for PC will synchronize itself with my Android devices, so I can very quickly see my new music on my smartphone and tablets almost as quickly as it appears on my laptop.
 
 Amazon Music also serves as a music player on my devices. It does a very good job of sound reproduction, although its perhaps not quite in the same league with some other of the more full-featured (and expensive) music players.
 
 I am very pleased with the Amazon Music app. It serves my purposes well, even though I dont subscribe to Amazons music service. Highly recommended.",amazon

 2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling. I'm forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.
 
 3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist. Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums. This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.
 
 4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application. This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application. This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.
 
 5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks. The ability to thumbs up / down or star tracks is sorely missed.
 
 6. Video Content - None
 
 7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms. If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.
 
 8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow. It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing. This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.
 
 9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to... Show me similar artist, records, songs. Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!
 
 10. Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature. However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.
 
 11. Android Screen controls. The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android. There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).
 
 Overall the service is adequate. There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market. I signed my family up for a year. They all hate it! We will give the service a fair shake over the year. If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again. I expected better from Amazon. okayay is not good enough.",amazon
2/20/2017,"Adding my voice here. Currently using up 3.52 GB of my usable 4.94 GB. Refuses to be relegated to SD card storage. Read about some app that will let you move your purchased music to SD but won't move prime music. I guess prime just has to be streamed if you want to use it. Lookay amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone. You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected. You don't need to hog my internal memory. I guess you are only for top end phone users. I can't afford you.
 
 Listen from the cloud you say? Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and don't let the phone display go dark, the music stops. I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.
 
 So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what? It tookay the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone. Music that I use other apps to play since those apps don't stop every 15 seconds. Amazon, I love you. But I hate your music app.",amazon
6/10/2015,"I *hate* the new user interface. I use the app on my FireTV with a Logitech Harmony remote (so no voice control - a worthwhile sacrifice to consolidate all remotes). The new interface completely does away with the ability to jump alphabetically through your songs and albums. You now have to scroll all the way through your library staring with the numbers and slowly making your way through each and every title in your library. I have hundreds of albums and thousands of songs. This interface change has made the music app useless to me, and negated a big part of the reason I bought the FireTV in the first place. I really hope to see this addressed soon.",amazon
12/3/2016,"I HATE this app. I can't believe Amazon can't get something better designed. As far as maneuvering when using the app, it seems to be extremely sensitive....you can scroll down and all of a sudden what you were working with is gone, or hover over something for a second and you're another spot. My search bar doesn't work, it pulls up nothing, so I've been scrolling to find stuff and I have A LOT of music (see my complaint about scrolling). Much of my downloaded music is missing information and I have to manually fill it in otherwise music isn't where it should be...for instance, I had an album that was downloaded as 12 separate songs because there were no track numbers. I can't click and drag one album or artist to another area, so anything from, say, Joan Jett is separate from anything filed under Joan Jett & the Blackhearts...I have to manually change the info. Many albums have the wrong album cover art, sometimes even belonging to another artist, and some albums have no art whatsoever....there doesn't seem to be a way to copy an image from the internet, so I can't fill it in manually. The app is visually boring. I liked it so much better when you downloaded and it went straight to Media Player...Media Player is a far better app.",amazon
7/1/2016,"I just bought an album and went to download and while before I could just initialize the download directly into my computer files, NOW it is forcing me to download the Amazon Music App in order to access my songs. Maybe I'm lookaying in the wrong spot, but the options I once had before are gone. I don't care about whatever features are in this app, I don't need or want them. This takes up space in my hard drive and it's not like iTunes, Xbox Music (which is terrible by the way), or Windows Media Player aren't enough for me. I swear I am deleting this app as soon as it lets me pull my music out of it. To tell you the truth, this is such a pain in the butt that I probably won't download music from here anymore. 0 stars if I could!",amazon
5/25/2015,"I hate to downrate the app to two stars. Overall, the app is a nice player. Unfortunately, the app forces you to save to the phones (Galaxy3)internal SD card which in my phone does not have sufficient room for my music. The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone. At this time you have two options, root the phone and remap the phones internal SD storage location or copy the music files to the external SD (which breaks playlists).
 
 If Amazon were to fix that one problem I would re-rate the app to 5 stars.",amazon
2/14/2013,"Uninstalled. It just removes music that you bought through them, the cloud storage is a jokaye as it is constantly rescanning, songs bought and saved to my sd card don't show up or just won't play. The prime music is not a good deal, as the songs are just removed with no warning (kills whatever Playlist it lives in with it). I play games, videos and other Internet intensive apps with no issue. Amazon plays two songs from MY device and still manages to skip and refuse to play. Utter garbage. No customer support either. Just one maddening phone call after another that translates to 'got your money, sucka!' Officially done.",amazon
6/21/2016,"The interface it not the easiest to navigate and makes it difficult to perform actions on songs/albums while actively playing music. The process of having to first find a song in the Amazon library, then figure out if it is a Prime music track or only available for additional fee, and finally having to move the song from the Amazon library to your library before being able to play the entire thing is tedious. I should be able to have a standing filter that only shows music I dont need to pay extra for and I should be able to stream whatever is presented without having to first add it to some other library. The radio feature is limited to preset stations. There is no continuous playlist option to supplement the active playlist with a radio selection based on the most recent playlist selection.
 
 As far as glitches: When you are lucky enough to find the song you want, and have it be part of the Prime offering, then you have the issue of actually playing the track. Often when trying to add a new song to my library it will indicate it has been added, but then when I go to play the song nothing happens. Sometimes the song will play after a minute or two, but other times you have to exit the application completely and relaunch it to get the new songs to play. This is very frustrating when you simply want to listen to a new song!
 
 And the good stuff: Once you start to play a track there are no hiccups in the audio output. Youd think this would go without saying, but a lot of the steaming services that have web based players dont seem to be able to get this right, including Spotify and Google Music. Having an application on the desktop is one way to assure smooth playback, although some services seem to be able to make good web players that can do this too. Also, the quality of the recordings sounds good to me, with no loss of quality that I could readily notice due to the applied compression.",amazon
7/5/2015,"Disappointed that it messed all my music up when it imported it over from i-tunes - it mixed a lot of the album covers up with the wrong albums and tracks and doesn't import all types of audio files.

6/30/2014,"This app has had a few iterations and I appreciate the complexity of adapting a program like this in an agile fashion, But, routinely there are changes that are not thought-through and the constant changes in functionality, removal of some functionality and lack of comprehensive design principles can be very, very frustrating. My latest gripe is the ""download playlist"" button that loads a second after the button right next to it, which is ""shuffle playlist."" Several times now I've gone to push the ""shuffle playlist"" button and then the ""download playlist"" button loads into it's place. Now my phone is slowed down in attempts to download the playlist. When all I wanted to do was listen to the playlist! Rrrrrr. Sometimes I wonder if anyone at Amazon actually uses the product. I do, everyday, and I would love to help (re)design it. Just a bit more attention to design principles is all I ask.",amazon

With this app you can put it right back with a few simple steps. It's great.,amazon
3/21/2014,"I need to play around with Amazon Prime music some more, to figure it out, but my initial reaction is not positive. My breakdown after 1 day or so lookaying at it:
 
 I found it difficult to navigate the app, particularly with respect to what is included as Prime Streaming and what is not. More specifically, it's frustrating that the ""Prime"" (i.e., no additional cost) music is sort of mixed in with all the stuff that is for purchase.
 
 With Google Play Music, it takes some effort to actually go and purchase something. Basically what you find in Google Play Music streaming is available to you for unlimited streaming and included in your subscription cost.
 
 With this service, I'm wary that I might click on something and end up buying it. Maybe that is the point, really.
 
 Amazon needs to clearly separate the ""free"" (i.e.included in Prime subscription) streaming music from the rest for this app to be very useful.",amazon
6/20/2014,Extremely frustrating!! Amazon keeps telling me that my password is not valid. I keep changing it and they keep saying that it is not valid. I can easily access the cloud music from my PC.......phone doisn't know that it exists....just keeps telling my the my password is not valid.,amazon
1/6/2014,i have downgraded my review of this app. first pro is that you can download music for offline play. if you have an android device (for example my galaxy tab A) you can put that downloaded music onto the ext card. pro: i love the curated playlists that amazon creates. now the con which knock off 2 stars - IT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING & CONFUSING APP I HAVE EVER EVER ENCOUNTERED. once you add an album or playlist to your library GOOD LUCK IN FINDING IT LATER. if you add more than one album it adds them all in a row of songs instead of individual albums - AGAIN SO FRUSTRATING AND CONFUSING. many times i get so frustrated that i just into recents and play that. why does it have to be the opposite of user friendly?,amazon
10/1/2015,"I like the idea of amazon music, but the execution is very poor. When I'm driving, which is when I tend to listen to music, the music stalls and stutters. I can rarely get through an entire song. It doesn't seem to matter whether I'm playing music from the cloud or if it's downloaded. Even the streams you've created don't work properly. Very frustrating.",amazon
10/9/2015,"App doesn't work on my Android (Samsung Note). It had worked fine for quite some time and then one day stopped working properly. I went through Amazon ""tech support,"" which was a jokaye. The tech told me the problem was that I didn't have the latest version. It was a real hassle to download the latest version because I first had to download some Amazon App which is equivalent to a play store. The tech informed me that if I downloaded it elsewhere (like from other play stores or even the Amazon site) it wouldn't be the latest version. In the end it still didn't work, so the tech did some more checking and then told me they were having issues with Samsung devices but were working on it. Very frustrating and a big waste of time. Amazon Music works fine on my iPhone and, of course, through my Fire TV, but the music is very limited if you're not into pop stuff. This made the whole experience even worse because it wasn't worth my time. Amazon really needs to get it together if they expect to compete with Pandora and Spotify. .",amazon

The only way I have found to use this is to download it to my computer first and then copy and paste the songs/albums to my Android device!! Really?? In this day and age??

6/12/2014,"I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs & limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.
 
 The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.
 
 It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.
 
 Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.
 
 Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...
 
 It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.
 
 I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.
 
 Thanks for reading my review.",amazon
6/14/2014,"I really want to love this app. I really do. Having legally free music is appealing and having good recommendations made has certainly increased the library of music I'm playing.
 
 But this app is absolute garbage. It was designed by someone that never has used a music app before. Maybe it's my phone? I have some spare cell phones, I'll try this on to see if I experience the same issues and update my review.
 
 For reference, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (t-mobile variation) and I'll be testing it on my Nexus 5 (old model) and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus (T-mobile variation) and a Samsung Galaxy S3 if it powers up.
 
 So here are the huge glaring issues with this app and service:
 
 1) You can only upload 250 songs to the cloud. That's pitiful. Amazon is the damn king for cloud computing. I refuse to believe they can't easily and at low cost up that number. Google play music (which I was using before) let's you upload 50,000 songs. A 250 limit severely restricts us and I refuse to rebuy my music catalog from amazon mp3.
 
 2) If you add more music to your playlists from your computer, and you hit download on your app instead of it just downloading the new tracks you added onto the same playlist (ie Favorites) it creates a new playlist (Favorites 01) it doesn't redownload everything, but it's a nuisance. In a year what will I be at? Favorites 69?
 
 3) Why can't think app sync with the music app on my Amazon Fire Tv? With google play music I can connect to google play on my chromecast and play my music on my surround system, I want to do that on here as well so I don't have to constantly skip tracks I've already heard recently.
 
 4) This is the by far the biggest frustrating issue for me.....and related to # 3. This app has never once played a playlist all the way through. And it is INFURIATING. What's the point of having a 800 song playlist if it keeps restarting!?! I listen to music on the way to work and I'll get to track 8 of 800 and when I drive home in the afternoon I should be able to resume on track 9 of 800. But it doesn't. It. Keeps. Restarting. So I spend most of time skipping tracks, because ""i just heard that this morning, heard that yesterday."" Google Play Music never once had this issue.
 
 I want to hear a playlist all the way through. I want to get home, sync the app to amazon fire tv and listen to music as I wash dishes, then go to the gym and continue my playlist. And I want to not have the playlist keep starting over again every time I open the app.
 
 I switched from Google Play Music because of the allure of all that free prime music, and it has introduced me to some really great stuff I'd never heard before. But the app is currently a brokayen mess.",amazon
5/26/2016,"I've been using Amazon Music for a few years, and enjoyed downloading purchases to my android phone so I can play my own music in my car. Now, however, I can't get through a single song through the car without an error message (exception 180) that stops the player cold. The error messages suggest I ""try again,"" but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I've PAID FOR from my device. This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Now, I have to find a music player that doesn't hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music won't play on any other player, that I've tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper. And, from what I'm seeing on these message boards, Amazon customer service hasn't even bothered to address this issue with the customers who present it. What a big FAT disappointment, Amazon.",amazon

 2) Compilations are not grouped under one album. Every single song lists the exact same album name, yet Amazon MP3 creates a separate album for every artist. So you can't just click on an comp and let it play. You have to go back and choose a new song every time, which is maddening when you consider problem #1 above. I'm guessing Amazon would respond that there's something in the metadata that doesn't flag it as a comp, but come on. If I'm in album view, just combine the albums with the same name.",amazon

Then about 6 hours after I first got the &#34;Prime&#34; song I tried to play it again and the app said it was no longer available, then removed it from my list. Lame!

Ever since the last update it randomly ""stutters"" when playing a song or stops competely. I can't get it to clear off my phone after I turn it off. It has also become a pain to navigate. Before this last update I would have given the app 5 stars. I hope that they fix what they screwed up. No longer a fan.",amazon
12/10/2013,"Your app is very limited that sometimes it gets close to absurdity.
 
 1. I expended over a $100 in your store to get a 128GB memory card. I have not taken advantage of it because your app doesnt allow specifying in which folder I want the music to be downloaded. I have to maneuver and keep transferring the music manually which is really aggravating. At times, if I have no done a recent transfer to the memory card and I will not be at home in a while, Im in such need of memory that I have to clear the whole Amazon music from my phone. The start the whole process again.
 
 2. To free up memory from my device, I selected the voicemails messages to be downloaded to the memory card. Your app makes them part of the library. Worse than that, I cant delete them all at once or better, just delete them from the library but keep them stored in my phone. At times I had deleted over 20 voice mails one by one from the app library. That how stupid it becomes.
 
 3. Same as #2, I have downloaded complete playlists from Prime. I discover songs that I dont like and I dont know how to get rid of them while keeping the rest of the library intact.
 
 4. I can't play my music offline and wasting my cell phone data streaming. When I try to play music supposedly downloaded to my cellphone, I get an error message with a ""Exception #180"" code
 
 It is such a painful waste of time when you can solve that in less than an hour. That is why you hire software engineers and geeks. Any of them can take care of all of the above during lunch time.",amazon
11/30/2014,"Finally this lousy app allows you to download the music YOU OWN directly to your MicroSD card, which I understand was a problem with Android, not Amazon (the problem occurred with many other non-Amazon apps).
 
 That being said... this app still needs major work.
 
 DLs of music I bought/own don't always work, but there's no indication from the app that they didn't complete. So you think you have the whole song, and instead you have only half or less.
 
 On top of that, it is SUCH A PAIN to try to delete and reDL the song, because this must be done from completely different screens and requires stepping back through multiple menus. It is neither easy nor intuitive.
 
 As a Prime user, I'm allowed to DL some Prime music I *don't* own for offline listening. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. The app won't tell you why.
 
 There's no way to remove the gaps between songs the way they would sound if playing a CD or album. There are FREE apps that let you do this or let you crossfade, which this app also doesn't let you do.
 
 There's NO graphic equalizer. Again, there are free music player apps that do this!",amazon
1/7/2016,"The app needs some improvement in order to make it more user friendly. It has a very generic setup. The biggest pain is getting your library move over from another service like Apple Music. It's not easy if you have playlist you want to keep in place without having to make new ones. Sorting is limited, very limited columns selections in your songs catagory (roughly 2 choices vs Apple Music has over 40 choices). It has a duplicate choice in advance settings, but there is no option(or a way) for the user to run a duplicate command like Apple Music. Preference tab is very limited as well. These things makes this service well behind Apple Music, but like any other service it can be improved. The one big advantage Amazon music has over Apple is price. Amazon does offer 2 months off for a full year subscriptions vs Apple which offers no discount which is why I decided to give Amazon a try.",amazon
6/7/2017,"So buggy, i wouldn't use it if it didn't come with prime. I can't believe that amazon finds it acceptable. Music will often not load or the app will crash out mid session, if you make a playlist that has online and online music it can't play offline (just skip the online). I will download music and it still acts like it online music only. The app will turn on randomly and play music (happened once in a meeting which wasn't cool). In addition its painfully hard to exit the program on your phone, its like one of those bloatware apps that just wont go away once you opened it. It is easy to find free music or purchase music though and works on both iphones and androids. The iphone app seems to be less buggy then the android (no surprise).",amazon
9/22/2016,"As a Prime member this is a nice way to get music since you have access to hundreds of artists and genre of music.
 But the app is designed piss poor and is not user friendly at all.
 
 First, the interface is PAINFUL to use. Not only does the app NEVER keeps your music last listened to in check, there is no real way to make a Playlist, keep recently played music in check or even find what you last listened to. Sometimes the app saves it but half the time I am lookaying for what I last listened to which is annoying!
 
 Secondly, the UI is confusing. It list cloud, Prime music, library and store but it never really has the list right for what you were listening to or want to listen to. It is just really a pain to find music I want to hear, even my own music!
 
 Thirdly, how do you make a Playlist? I still haven't figured that out. The app is so painful to use I really haven't bothered.
 
 If you just want to listen to music it okay for that. The app itself is a mediocre music player.",amazon
4/13/2016,"Adding songs to your playlists is a pain. Rather than the normal way of searching for a song and then adding it to your playlist you first have to add it to you library, then you have to go into your library and search for the song again, then you can choose to add it to your playlist. And the biggest problem is that there is no SD card support. Many phones have limited storage, but Amazon doesn't care about us people with older phones. It makes the app nearly worthless.",amazon
9/30/2015,"okay, have been a prime customer just about ever since I can remember. Joined Prime Music this year, tookay a while to get use to it over Pandora, but was fine until today. Went to my favorite play list and there were a bunch of songs that were Prime music and use to play all the time, and now the Prime logo is greyed out, and a prompt comes up with remove or buy. Truly a bait and switch tactic, that could almost be considered against the law. Second issue, last month I uploaded or I should say tried to upload discs out of my personal library. What a pain, they would only allow certain songs to be uploaded to my prime account, dialog box stated: incompatible format. Odd, they play on everything else I own. Most likely a licensing or royalty issue. Not at all happy now. I had a Stevie Ray Vaughn album that was all Prime Music, went to play today, all greyed out, they want me to buy now.Iit wasn't uploaded, don't own a copy. I will provide an update if I hear from them. I don't like surprises, don't think anyone does.",amazon
10/3/2016,"I'm fairly computer literate and this is a painful application/service to use. This is especially true if you have a large library to upload to the cloud. I'm talking weeks of babysitting this thing to get them there.
 
 Also, the app is very slow to respond when scrolling around in My Library. There should be a local index so this doesn't happen. Of course, the Store browsing works reasonably well since they only have tiny web pages (a couple of screens long).
 
 This service is a valuable component to the Alexa universe. Pleeeeeze, Get it right. It honestly seems like Amazon really doesn't want you to use your music you already own, in favor of a streaming service. It may be fine for some, but personally, I don't want Amazon feeding me music via streaming. I want MY music. Think about this.... What if your parents told you what was popular and you had to stream from that.",amazon

12/20/2016,"the worst app for moving music i have ever seen, im fan of amazon and using alexa with amazon echo a lot, but this app is something out of ordinary, you realy have to make an effort to design app so poor.
 what i think most people will use this all with their amazon prime subscription is upload music and then listen to echo when needed... but whole process is so slow and complicated, its not even worth using it. after few hours of trying to upload, i only managed to made my Echo play 10-20 of my music, out of 100s i tried to upload.
 whole process is designed to be worst possible user friendly one. i think only person who will understand whats going is the guy who wrote the program.
 realy hoped that thery will change interface of do something with this app. but 5 months passed and nothing.

This has been a cluster since I was in the beta.... every time they upgrade, it gets worse and worse. After this last update, when I open it, I get an error message that says there is no disk in the drive, and It wont go away, and Amazon Music locks up..... can't use it at all. I've uninstalled and re-installed, and it does the same. About six months ago I called in for support, and they said it could not handle over 40K songs, but I was only at 33K. Still they said it was due to high song amount. I pay amazon so that I'm supposed to be able to upload up to 250K songs. That is not even the worst. I have a compilation set with 4 albums, and Amazon made a different album for each song. It is fraught with issues all the way through, and I have been telling amazon for almost a year about these issues, and it just keeps getting worse.

Force closes for no reason, terrible organization, storage and RAM hog, causes phone to freeze to the point that I have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it, and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long. Seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through Amazon Prime, I guess I'm stuck with this crappy app. Otherwise I am going to use the slightly less glitchy Google play music. Seeing as I am paying for this mangled service, and assume some of my payment is going to app development, I'm highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from Amazon.

4/19/2016,"I'm using the IOS app. It actually works pretty well. It seems that some albums in my library need a little update in the metadata, and it will be easier to find the stuff I'm lookaying for.
 
 I've got about 30k songs in my collection. I'm trying to upload all those so that I can access them across all my devices (including my echo). The Amazon music program on the PC and MAC are by far the worst cloud upload program I have ever worked with. Let me list the problems:
 
 1) I've got a 4-core 8-thread core i7 machine, it maxes out all my CPU in order to do 3 parallel streams of uploading. On my macbookay pro, it shows 110% CPU on a 4 core machine. Uploading a file should not be a CPU intensive process. It slows down my entire PC, where typing stuff into a web browser is about 1 character a second.
 2) The underlying threads kindof work (I get lots of ""Cloud Service Not Responding Errors""), you have to go back through and ask it to retry files one at a time. Because it's so slow, it takes about 30 seconds to actually select, hit retry, and click ""got it"" and have the popup dissappear.
 3) The UI hangs, so you have no idea what it's actually doing. I have to resort to hitting refresh on the browser on the website to see what has actually been uploaded. It gives a popup when the upload is complete, but that only happens about 20% of the time (if you're uploading 5 songs at a time). If you upload like 100 songs at once, then it just hangs and shows busy forever (even hours after it completed uploading the last file). You have to quit the program, and go into the task manager and actually kill it. I now do that between every upload.
 
 Amazon solutions are typically very good. The kindle programs work amazingly well. This one is total crap, which is a shame for an otherwise very good service (from what I can tell). If they can get this fixed, then their offering should be very competitive.",amazon

8/3/2015,"***THE WORST MUSIC SOFTWARE***
 
 1. Doesn't play the majority of the songs I've uploaded.
 2. Sometimes replaces album art with incorrect ones.
 3. Sometimes deletes lyrics from various songs (not really relevant since the Amazon Music Player doesn't display lyrics, unless that feature is enabled and then you're left with songs without lyrics)
 
 Amazon refuses to play most of my songs that were uploaded to the cloud. These are original mp3 or m4a files. I don't understand what the problem is. Some play, some don't. Why?
 
 I did find a workaround that involves uploading, downloading, and then uploading again. That's right: upload the song, then download it back to your computer, delete the original uploaded song from Amazon's cloud server, and then re-upload the downloaded song. It appears that certain things are delete from the original uploaded, such as lyrics. Maybe Amazon doesn't like certain lyrics? Who knows!!!",amazon

There are extremely long pauses while browsing my collection and frequent force closes. I really would prefer the functionality and layout of Amazon's app, but the horrible lag in browsing the UI is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this app for large music collections.

 So far, so good.
 
 But, there are horrible limitations with this app that Amazon could easily fix, if they wanted to:
 
 1) It won't download music to your SD card
 I bought a 64GB SD card so I could listen to my music when I didn't have a connection (and also so I wouldn't have to worry about using too much data).
 But when it downloads music it goes to your phone's internal memory, and can't be set to use an SD card. Why? Why? Why? My Galaxy Note II has just 16GB of internal memory, which is needed for programs, etc. There is not much space to store a bunch of music. That's why I bought the SD card (from Amazon!). Google Music let's you download to SD - you can too!
 
 2) It will let you download your music, but still streams it from the cloud
 I was enjoying listening to my music from the Amazon cloud so much that I was pushing against my Verizon data limits. No problem, I thought, I'll just use the handy download function in the app. So, before a big car trip I created a playlist and clicked the download button. On the drive I pulled up the playlist and started to play it. Everything seemed great until I lost the 4G signal and the music stopped. What happened? Hadn't I downloaded the songs? Well, yes, the songs had downloaded to my phone, but the stupid Amazon MP3 player was still streaming the songs over the Internet, even though it ""knew"" that it had already downloaded them all. Stupid!
 
 3) No gapless playback.
 Try listening to Dark Side of the Moon or Abbey Road with gaps between all the songs and it just ruins the experience.",amazon

 The real benefit of Amazon Prime Music is no commercials otherwise every other music app (Pandora, Slacker, etc.) is much better in every way.
 
 The available music is limited and music stations in Amazon Prime Music are horrible. My guess is that it's because they want you to buy the unlimited music service or because they'd have to pay the artist and don't want to in a ""free"" service. Example: The other apps have a ""top pop station"" where all the latest and greatest is played and the selection is excellent. Amazon Prime Music - not even close. Amazon claims these stations / play lists are created by experts. I'd add say it differently....they're created by experts who are limited by the music available.",amazon

The version just released recently is absolutely horrible however. No longer can you click on a song and select ""artist"" or ""album."" You just have the option to play it. A quick way of playing an album I recently purchased or uploaded was to just find it in the ""recently added"" playlist. Now you can just click on an individual song and listen to the entire playlist. What is really egregious though is when you go to ""my music"" you can get to your songs, artists or albums and they are in alphabetical order as before but what is missing is the alphabet menu shortcut we had before where we could jump to an artist like Joyce Manor for example, just by quickly scrolling to the J. Now you have to scroll through each individual artist name by name which if you have a large library can take quite a while. I feel like I'm being pushed by Amazon into relying on playlists and using the music app as if it was Pandora or something. I prefer my own library and that's what I want to play but this app makes that more challenging.",amazon
10/8/2016,"Amazon Music, not quite ready for ""prime""time, and if I had to pay for the service, I'd request my money back.
 
 Heres why I say this. First, create your own playlist. It's kinda good, the prime catalog is lacking, and I have yet to discover the magic bean that will allow me to add my local music on my PC to playlists on my phone (same account) that I can achieve VIA google music. Add to that I added 500 songs to my prime playlist.. It repeats the same 20 songs, I don't even hear some artists I've added.
 
 Then came the ""stations"" these in theory are great, Pandora killer I thought.. But holy crap are the stations HORRIBLE. lets try punk rock. I hear the same 13-18 songs repeated. Half of which aren't really in the genre. Lets switch to the stations titled ""Van Halen"" One van halen song, then you'd expect a high energy classic rock song, nope.. Lets toss on something a lot slower by abba, stevie knicks or Fleetwood mac. Yeah, they're in the same class.
 
 Long song? No problem.. We'll cut it off before it ends...
 
 Add to that the app likes to stop playing, then start again, then stop again.. When writing this review I turned on the van halen station, connected to 4G, it would play one song and stop. Connected to work wifi, still played one song and stopped. Finally rebooted my phone, Plays one song and stops.. Not the best app in the pool at this time. Absolutely doesn't enhance my prime membership yet. Keep trying amazon..",amazon

12/9/2013,"I've been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service. Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it. Well, I'm wrong. My husband has already declared ""it sucks!"". But I don't listen as often and I have more ""mainstream"" tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no. Here is a short list of why I don't like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible. So much so that, even though it's essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I'd rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app. The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain won't recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud. Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are ""re-recorded""versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song. I've not run across this with Spotify or Google Play. What's the deal with this scam?
 
 In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song (good luck if you can find it on Prime Music) . But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else.",amazon

My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all. I love that it remains ""running"" when it doesn't even work.

I've used this on my HTC One M7, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S5.all of them have terrible performance. On wifi, it is just barely acceptable. Over 3g or even 4g, it takes an almost obscene amount of time to start streaming. This may be expected when on lower bandwidth connections, but it isn't just that it is buffering. It takes up 90 percent cpu time, impacting anything else I am doing. Seeing the same behavior on 2 M7s, plus the tablet and the S5,indicates it is an app problem. Initially I thought it was a side effect of the initial synching, but the problem continues days later.
 
 On the positive side, being able to download so you can listen offline is great. As I said, the app itself is easy and intuitive for the most part. If the performance can be addressed it will be a great app. As it is, it is relegated to occasional use.",amazon

 Update October 2016
 
 I finally got used to the process of uploading and customizing, and they changed the whole thing, preventing the organizing of folders, songs, albums as we would like. Now it is virtually useless and unwieldy, with side bars expanding, and extremely difficult to simply lookay through folders.

However,I did experience some issues.The fact that when I was listening to a song and lost my internet connection, the song would start all over and you're forced to listen to the entire song all again once connection has been restored.Another thing I disliked about Prime Music was the fact that there's not many artists.Only really known ones.One of the things that really bugged me a bit was the fact that the app needed a lot of my private information.Like no thank you.I ended up uninstalling the app for that reason and since it tookay up a lot of space on my phone.I'd rather stick to Pandora.",amazon
1/5/2016,While I love the music the app on my Samsung Note 3 is terrible. It fails repeatedly. It give me a message with a code and tells me to contact customer service. Why does the app not send this report itself? Once the error starts it is hard to even clear as it just keeps retrying the function and errors out again. Today I was just trying to edit a playlist. I have to reboot the phone after I add or delete 3 or 4'songs as the errors start. I don't want to call customer service. Oddly now as I pokaye around it seems picking up the phone is my only option. Nowhere is the online chat support? Send a text or email?,amazon
12/1/2015,"This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I've got that done there's no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by (say) Artist I've got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.
 
 Searching isn't terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, ""m"" there's no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I'm moved to a different search tab. This isn't rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you're this app is doing isn't better.
 
 Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it's laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. There's a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I'm forced to use it when (say) interacting with my Echo.",amazon
9/27/2015,"Let me start by saying, I have been using computers since I was 5, and by now with some ease. I am no stranger to downloading music, I've been doing so since the Napster days.
 
 Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. It's bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.
 
 Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure ""oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me!"". Wrong. It's genuinely terrible.
 
 Just today, I purchased 20 or so songs, but in order to retrieve them (oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS) I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history.

I can't believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle, Spotify, etc. The only advantage of this app is that it is cheap. But, functionally, it it terrible. I have been an Amazon customer an Prime member for 5 years, but I have to admit that their venture into the music world leaves a lot to be desired. Amazon, you can do better with the (almost) unlimited resources that you have. Spend some more time and money on this application and you could be the best, but if this is what you are willing to invest in this, users, please go elseware.",amazon
12/23/2015,"I used to LOVE Amazon's Music App, but with the recent change they eliminated a lot of features that I used and turned the app into something that is to me completely useless.
 
 CONS
 
 0) It's just slow, and laggy, and freezes all the time. While I'm uploading or it decides to download something (completely outside of my control) it can not be used.
 
 EDIT***
 
 Since the time of my originally posting this review amazon has introduced several updates that have incremementally begun to address my problem and I am so thankful for that. I had started using another music player but it is so much easier to have the program that i use to download my music also play it and it's great to see that a company as big as Amazon can listen to complaints and improve on products. I STILL want it to be a lot easier to remove music from my computer directly from the ap but they added the ""see file on computer"" option back again so if I really want to I guess I can use that. Thanks Amazon.
 
 1) On the new app they have this extensive list/filtering system which is mostly redundant and yet so complicated I hardly ever know what subset of my music I am listening to. Is it my OFFLINE music, on the CLOUD, filtered by download date... or is it the ALBUMS section with ALL MUSIC, yet only purchased songs ordered by upload date? There is NOTHING smart about this set-up and it only serves to obscure the next point
 
 2) I CAN'T STOP IT FROM DOWNLOADING EVERYTHING! I like to try out new albums/songs and support artists.. So I buy the album and keep it on the cloud and download my favorite songs for easy listening even without internet (yaknow if I wind up in the stone ages or something..) Maybe somewhere along the line I accidentally hit dl everything, although I don't believe that I did- but even so I can not find any setting that would be able to help me change that! furthermore they tookay away the ability to click on a song and find it on my computer which I could have potentially used to delete unwanted songs from my computer. AND NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO DELETE A SONG INSTEAD OF GIVING ME THE OPTION TO DELETE IT FROM THE COMPUTER OR THE CLOUD IT ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT THE CLOUD.
 
 3) It's now more difficult than ever to donload or upload songs when I want to... having me drag and drop songs onto the words, upload or download is totally unintuitive especially since I usually like to deal in multiple songs.. which leads me to the INABILITY TO HIGHLIGHT MULTIPLE SONGS. That is a completely necessary/useful option that I don't understand the logic behind taking out.
 
 4) When I click ""make a playlist"" from this song- nothing happens... I probably just do not understand what I was supposed to do maybe? But I am fairly computer literate and a programmer myself so if I can not understand it I assume that most are quite perplexed.
 
 PROS
 
 The color scheme is nicer... the icon lookays good?
 
 I originally was going to give this app a 2 star rating becuse I think the aesthetics really were an upgrade... but honestly there is such a downgrade in functionality this app is terrible now.. If there were any other way to easily download and listen to my music that I buy from Amazon I would be there right now..",amazon
11/8/2016,It is a terribly complicated way to upload and categorize music. If you upload your own music it uses the Artists name as the main indentifier and if there are multiple artists it creates an album for each of them instead of seeing the album as a whole. You can edit but the app is not user friendly in that it requires multiple steps each time you edit an album. Unlike iTunes you cannot edit the entire album information all at one time. It requires you to do that song by song. Terrible. I am not a fan of iTunes but I find it more user friendly then Amazon music.,amazon
11/23/2016,"Amazon needs to do some serious fixing on their digital media. I tried music for the first time after getting a prompt that im only using 2 services What happens with my first experience? ""Try again Later"" Yes thats what I wanted to see. Same applies to movies. Tookay two attempts and at least a half hour to get a movie to play. Last time I tried to watch a movie it was telling me I couldnt watch it in HD, ""not enough bandwidth"" I have 60 meg bandwidth router 10 ft from TV. Those services are terrible. Amazon. Renewal Im thinking not.",amazon
11/18/2015,"I can't give negative stars, or else I would. There is no reason this product needs Android beyond 2.1. The best use for a old phone or device is to put it in a corner as a music player. But this requires that you be on the most current version of Android. Useless app.
 
 It needs far too many permissions and is a data hog. I believe that is why they want the more current Android, in order to assure they are on my current device.",amazon
8/20/2015,"I love the Amazon Cloud service, and I store my entire music library on it. Unfortunately, my experience with it has been inconsistent and disappointing. I have an iPhone, and if I use the app on there for more than about 5 minutes, it locks up my phone, and it can take a full minute for it to respond. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and for some reason, Amazon decided to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre. That might not seem like a big deal for some people, but it's huge for me. Really makes the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to. I realize there are competition issues between Amazon and Apple, and Amazon and Google, but these inconsistencies and poor performance is a real let-down from Amazon.",amazon
1/9/2013,"Unlike others, I don't want to download all my music onto my phone. That would be impossible! I own a LOT of music, and when this app was Amazon MP3, I was easily convinced that I should upload all of my digital music to Amazon, and then I could play it wfrom my phone where ever I was (as long as I had a good internet connection, of course). Got a new phone, and I downloaded the new Amazon Music app. What it shows as 'Cloud' music is only about 1% of the music I store on Amazon's cloud servers. I can't really review any other feature of the app, because my music is not accessible. I called Amazon, and was told they were working on it. A couple of days later there was an update, which did not fix this problem. Amazon can add all the features it wants, but if I cannot play the music I already own, the app is useless to me.",amazon

5/7/2015,"2 stars. I love music. I had this app on an android phone and it had no SD support. Which made it useless since most android phones have what like 4 gb of internal storage. I've tried running this one a iphone. The app crashes all the time or loses its place and I have to start the app over again. No love there. So this is the big one. I have an Amazon Fire phone. yes, I'm one of the 5 people who bought one of these silly things. But to be honest its a pretty solid phone. So I was really shocked that you have to run this silly app to connect on their phone and not their built in music. On top of that the app stops playing all the time. There I am enjoying a song and all of sudden with no warning. Silence. I can push any button on the phone and the music starts again. Or if I'm lucky the music will start up again with no interaction (like its buffering and this isn't me streaming. I playing the music I ""downloaded""). I can understand the other two platforms not working all the time. I get it, its hard programing for other devices. But this is Amazons own phone! There is no logic in this place.",amazon
6/23/2015,"You have an internet connection. I downloaded a bunch of music but it won't play unless I have an internet connection, I wanted to be able to play my downloaded songs on road trips in between cell service but they won't play. Then there is the fact that you can only download songs to your phones memory and not an SD card, makes the 16 gigs of space I have available on my card pretty much useless",amazon
7/7/2014,"App lookays great and seems intuitive. Why 3 stars? No option to move cached prime music (downloaded for offline listening) to external SD card. Instead the app fills up valuable space on your internal device storage with encrypted media files. I'm not sure why they do this. It can't be for copy protection since anyone can easily copy the cached music (m4a files). The files are encrypted and useless without playing them through the app as designed.
 
 Other major problems:
 - no automatic volume normalization. Who wants to constantly turn the volume up and down with every song?
 - ""preview album"" function for listening to music I would potentially buy doesn't work reliably. I have to amazon.com through a browser and preview there.
 - Cannot read reviews of songs/albums. It shows how many stars and how many reviews, but does not take you to any reviews if you try to click on them",amazon
3/11/2015,"This issue with the app only playing music from a specific destination folder on the internal card is also creating another problem, playing music you didn't purchase from Amazon.

4/27/2011,"I have been using the Amazon Music App on my Tablet pretty much since it became available. I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet. This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App, this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.
 
 However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had (meaning songs I didn't download from Amazon). I have my entire library on random so after the 20th track of very old music, I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists. I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device (why wouldn't they be?), yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I'm offline. Even albums I've purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app. I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members, (System of a Down, 311, Disturbed, etc), yet for some reason the app doesn't want to play them anymore unless I'm connected to the internet.
 
 If I connect to the internet, then viola!! all my downloaded content plays. But think about this for a moment, what is the purpose of downloading for ""offline play"" if I can only play them when I'm online? I don't know what changed but an app that worked so well is now brokayen and pretty much useless for what I use it for. I'm not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the 8 - 10 hours I'm at work just because Amazon decided to break something.
 
 This is incredibly ridiculous, and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull, and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library doesn't work. My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again, but I might not even bother because in 6 months it will probably break again.",amazon
1/13/2015,"I can't move it to my SD card. Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. It's pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it's a serious space hog and there just isn't enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can't be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I'll be more than happy to use it.",amazon
5/20/2016,"This app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that's bc it does SO MUCH! I wanna address 2 complaints I read abt 'no external SD support.' & that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist & that made the app a piece of crap. okayay, so 1st off, 500 songs is like 3 Days worth of music. I have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music. Does anyone's phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight?? if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot & prbly melt the phne. So, to me that's a useless comment & irrelevant. The other issue: I like that all the music us stored in the Cloud & it doesn't use ANY Storage space on my device. If u own the music u can download to ur device (it's fast!) to play offline if u ever get stuck or just don't want to use data. And, YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDERS 2 an external SD card if u have an Android (Samsung S5 user here). it works just like moving files on a computer. The hitch is this: u can download aNY of the music u want. However, u can only move the music you own. Amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: MP3 & MP4. It downloads in MP3 if u own it. Then u can move to an SD card & the app will find it & play it. MP4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage. Hopefully, most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this, so you can't transfer & steal music u haven't purchased.
 I personally think this is a great app & that Amazon Prime is better than sliced bread. I'm a true believer.",amazon

If I ""buy"" an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I'm using online to listen to it. (Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?).
 
 Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.
 
 And of course speakers on phones suck.
 
 So, Music?
 
 I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another ""source"" of music.
 
 I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service. And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface (downloading), it worked okayay. But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.
 
 I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.
 
 So so so....
 
 If you use it, more power to you.",amazon
7/5/2013,"The mobile app is pretty good. The site and the desktop app ui needs some work; very beta feeling. Also ran across some music that was encoded at poor quality. The download feature is really nice since I have a limited data plan and free with my prime membership is pretty cool. Lookays like the business model is to give you just enough free music to get you to use it, but with holes in collections to get you to purchase more.
 
 They do alow you to upload some of your music, but we still have yet to find the one app/service that will have everything. I currently use 5 now...",amazon
12/2/2015,I was dissapointed that the sound quality of the recording was extremely poor. This was probably associated with creating the mp3 recording. Amazon did refund the money but I would question if there is any quality control an if this problem will happen again. I will probably stick to cds.,amazon
11/21/2015,"Well, to make this fair... I love this app and prime music! I have had SAT radio for years, I accepted it for what it was. I don't have to any longer. My SAT radio always had a ""tin"" quality to the audio, but prime music is clear and amazing. I own a new F150 and have turned on the SAT only a few times. It's just as easy for my phone to automatically connect and start streaming. It sounds so much better. Choices, choices... Streaming stations, my library, or prime music that is usually available with my subscription! It's all there, in one place. You wouldn't think of writing a check for expensive, poor quality products, would you? So, stop feeding the SAT company. Prime is where it's at! Best of the best!!!",amazon
5/7/2016,Just a few percentage of music content is available for prime subscribers. I was attracted by the price but very disappointed when find out that just a few track are included in the prime account. In addition the player is too poor in options compared to spotyfy or beats music players.,amazon
5/18/2015,had issues with poor reception on LG phone. Now incompatible with Samsung phone...FRUSTRATION...Now Amazon account still reflects LG phone and won't update with new Samsung info...more FRUSTRATION... Now I can access music from cloud but only on pc ...then must transfer ... more frustration and irritation...,amazon
10/8/2013,"*** It should be noted that I wrote this review before Amazon converted this app to the ""cloud player"" so even though this app has the same name as the current one, there may be significant changes in how it works now. ***
 
 You can search, listen to samples, and buy songs with this app. However, there are no user controllable settings and it gives VERY little information about the song or the album while shopping. You also must sync this to your amazon shopping account and enable one-click purchases to make it work.
 
 This is a very basic app, which is a good thing to some degree... that's what keeps it simple. I'm glad it's not trying to be everything under one roof. I don't want it to be a music player and do all sorts of other annoying stuff like iTunes does. However, it is so limited that it's hard to feel like it's easy to use because the limitations require other work-arounds.
 
 ~~~Shopping Experience:~~~
 
 When shopping for songs or albums, there's no description, reviews, or anything else other than the artist, title, and a date (which is not explained--is that the release date or what?).
 
 Being able to listen to song samples so easily is a very nice feature. It's quite easy to search for a song, quickly find it, and listen to a sample before buying. It's great if you're not sure what song you're lookaying for.
 
 There are some strange things about it though. For example, several songs and albums I searched for have two versions of the same song for two different prices. Songs from the same name, artist, and album sometimes show up as two separate listings for $.99 and $.89 with no explanation of the difference. Are they different bit rates or something? Different formats? With no explanation available and no extra detail about the song... who knows what you're getting.
 
 There seems to be no way to put songs in a cart and buy them all in a single purchase. You must activate one-click on your amazon account to use this app. I just started using it so I haven't seen the credit card bill yet, but the way this works makes it seem as though there's going to be a separate $.99 charge on the card for every individual song you buy. This seems a little tedious. I would love to buy several songs at once in a single transaction.
 
 It would also be nice to buy up a credit balance for the phone like a gift card so I could just purchase songs as I discover them and have the cost deducted from my balance without paying for each separately. I don't want to have to share that with my other amazon web shopping however, so I'm not sure if a traditional Amazon gift card would work. It's all pretty poorly explained. If I were going to use this app a lot I would be tempted to create a new amazon account specifically for this app so I wouldn't have to commingle settings with my web shopping.
 
 Also, there seems to be no way to retrieve previously-purchased songs later on if they get lost or deleted. It would be really nice if it would put the song in a queue to download next time you sign in from your computer so you can easily use it there too. Currently I copy them from my phone to the computer... so why not just buy them on the computer and copy them to the phone? That's not any harder or easier so it contributes to my point that while the app is easy in itself, it requires a bunch of extra work to get the full value out of your music purchase thereby negating the so-called convenience of the apps simplicity.
 
 ~~~App Experience:~~~
 
 Because there are no user controls, you can't specify what folder the songs get put into or where it is located. Neither of the music players on my phone are able to find the amazon mp3 folder on their own (even after refreshing the media list) and therefore are unable to show and play the new music. So I had to install a file manager app, and each time I buy a song I have to copy the it to my normal music folder.
 
 Finally, the documentation for this app sucks. Actually working the app itself is pretty easy and self-explanatory (mostly because it has no features other than searching for songs and pressing the buy button), but it requires a whole bunch of coordination with your amazon account and its settings and the implications of all the little things you do are not at all evident. Everything is very poorly explained, if at all. You have to fumble through all the steps until you figure things out on your own. Then for the few topics they offer help with, it's takes you to a web page for an explanation... but comically, it's not a mobile-friendly web page so you have to zoom in and scroll left and right to read the lines. Seriously? These are web pages written specifically relating to a mobile phone app, ostensibly to be read primarily on a mobile phone, yet they're not in a mobile friendly format. Big fail.
 
 ~~Summary:~~~
 
 As powerful a site as amazon.com is, I'm a little surprised at how incredibly basic this app is. The way it works now, I find it much easier to just buy the songs from the amazon web site with a computer, and transfer them to the phone manually. The only time I envision using this app is when I'm away from my computer and desperately want a song right away.",amazon
3/25/2011,"I wish Amazon Music had the albums of some of favorite artists like Jessie or Yellowcard. I was very surprised to see that Beyonc's Lemonade album was available on Amazon Music because the selection of many artists' albums is scarce. Sometimes it downloaded music won't play if you have a poor signal or don't have a signal at all -- very annoying. Other than those small things, it's a great music service that's free with my Prime membership so I can't complain too much.",amazon
12/5/2016,"For over a month now, ""Amazon Music"" has a bug where the New Releases section in the ""Store"" - Not Prime... only shows music from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, etc.. I can't see what's new and listen to previews of new music before purchasing, because nothing from this side of the globe is even on there!
 This needs to be fixed. No wonder so many people get their music for free via Torrents, when our choices to PURCHASE and control our own music libraries are piss poor. Greed in the streaming only game is pathetic, and you can only push people so far.
 FIX THIS BUG!",amazon
1/12/2017,"I love Amazon music for certain music. Not at all for my Christian music. Not much of a selection. I love this one singer named Hilary Weeks but there is only one of her albums. I do like I can listen to all of Joey&Rory's music, Christian and county. Very poor when it comes to LDS singers.",amazon
6/24/2017,"Well, when lookaying for an alternative to Google Play, I thought for sure that Amazon would have their head on straight and would allow you to choose where the downloaded music is stored so that the memory limited main phone storage, which cannot hold my music collection, would not be crunched. Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well. There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application.",amazon
8/18/2013,"I wanted this app to be good since I'm a prime member. I could get over the clunky gui, but the app won't play more then one song off a playlist or album. This used to work fine but as updates have come it's gotten worse and worse. First it would only play five or six songs off a playlist/album. Now after the most recent update it will only play one then stop. The app will also crash every time I try to play a downloaded song. Really buggy and poorly written program. I expect much better from Amazon.",amazon
11/16/2014,"Using Android app on Samsung S4
 
 TL:DR - App not recommended and will not use in its current state even when service is free. Buggy, prescriptive and not user friendly. Pity as the service itself seems quite good.
 
 Pros :
 Simple install/setup - picks up amazon account by itself from your device if you already have another amazon app
 Managed playlists are nice, good varied selection
 Lots of good music in there
 
 Cons :
 Automatically scans your device and inserts any other music it finds into the app's music library
  - no way to disable this
  - no way to exclude or remove songs located elsewhere on your device (it simply adds them back in when it scans again)
  - no way to filter library so it only shows music you downloaded through Prime Music - it mixes it with anything it found during the device scan
 No way to specify download location - defaults to using internal storage instead of external SD card, limiting downloads severely.
 Stutters fairly frequently during playback of downloaded tracks.
 No way to perform a multi-select of artists/albums/tracks within the library - have to perform actions on each one individually (adding to playlist/remove from library etc).
 
 more settings needed in the poorly populated 'Settings' screen such as :
  - specify download location
  - specify which folder(s) to scan for exiting music
  - disable device scan",amazon
10/23/2015,"Most disappointed that Fire TV has no Amazon Music with Prime Music app yet. Also disappointed in this app on Android, it stalls A LOT and requires an app restart or reboot with reload. Streaming is MUCH better on the TuneIn Radio app on FireTV-Android-iOS from many different online radio stations all over the world. I tried Amazon Music with Prime Music also on Windows 7 and Mac OSX and found it to be inconsistent or get error messages even after installing the latest version of Adobe.
 
 On the other hand, Amazon Music with Prime Music seems to work fine on iOS on an iPod.
 
 Amazon adding their Amazon Music with Prime Music enticed me to finally get a Prime Membership of my own rather than use a family member's. However, while the Prime Video is awesome with lot of choice and solid streaming as are all of the Prime Video apps, I am rather disappointed in the Amazon Music poor streaming/buffering problems.",amazon
7/1/2014,"Crashes a LOT!
 App is slow, search is sluggish and inconsistent. I can search for an artist and it will return suggestions but no albums by that artist, but when searching for a similar artist the first shows up as a suggestion?! Sometimes searches return NO results but when I search again a few minutes later it finds results.
 The app sometimes switches between Cloud and Prime without warning. Music stutters too much compared to other players. I can stream HD in YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix just fine but I can't listen to a song from Amazon without it skipping.
 The selection is limited.
 Sound quality is poor. I hear a lot of the connotation artifacts, that under water sound.
 
 At least it works okayay enough to audition a few tracks before it crashes. It will help me make some purchasing decisions, though I doubt they will be made through this app.",amazon
10/1/2015,"I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.
 
 First I will say a few positives, the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think $7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.
 
 Now the Cons - easy things to fix:
 1. On the App, make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song, artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said, most other music apps are just as poor in this area - not a good excuse though.
 2. The music recommendations for offline mode - I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full. So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it won't try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for, offline music.
 
 Now the Cons - harder to fix, or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums, others are complaining as well:
 3. Integration with Echo - When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day, Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse, it doesn't even shuffle on the command ""Echo Shuffle My Music"" or ""Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account"". On this command, echo starts with the same songs until I say ""shuffle"" again and skip a song. Then it says ""enabling shuffle mode"" and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is brokayen and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10,000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the $25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up.
 4. Related to #3, when I do use the shuffle command, it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them, but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again, a month ago this was opposite, I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play, only Prime songs will shuffle, now it is reversed.
 
 I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time. If this improves I will update my review.",amazon
11/4/2016,"Lookays like Amazon is pushing people to Itunes with the latest iteration of Music.The prior app was relatively stable and offered music afficionados a reasonable interface for downloading their digital purchases. With the new ""blue"" release, I am back to downloading .ZIP files like it's 1999! This poor interface takes away the entire incentive of skipping cd purchases.
 
 As a prime member who purchases both hard and digital media, I am no longer purchasing digital (unless it's dance music), instead I will go back to CDs and rip them myself.
 
 Amazon, this iteration is complete crap. You can do better than this!",amazon
11/5/2016,"Just writing a review to give feedback. When I open the app to listen to offline music but have poor reception, it takes forever to load. If I turn off my internet connection, it loads instantly. Obviously there's a ""phone home"" check going on, and if you delayed that or did it in parallel, the app would perform much better!
 
 Otherwise, it's an okay app. I count Amazon music as a nice bonus to prime - certainly not why I got prime, but nice to have anyway",amazon
6/9/2017,"Prior versions of this app were uninspired but functional. The current version is so poorly designed as to be nonfunctional. I've moved back to iTunes.

4/9/2017,"It's a waste of time out of the gate on my android phone. I bought a bluetooth headset to listen to podcasts while I'm mowing the lawn.
 
 The podcast is already on my phone.
 
 I open Amazon music, which is supposed to play music on the device and voila, it does. It plays through the speaker on the device.
 
 I attach the headset and, uh, no. No audio. I can see it playing, I can hear the volume go up and down as it makes a ding each time I adjust the volume.
 
 I screw around and waste 20 minutes pairing and unpairing, lookaying at settings, nothing fixes it so I toss it on the bed and mow my lawn with nothing but the voices in my head to occupy my time.
 
 I come back in and install BlackPlayer. It works flawlessly out of the box.
 
 Amazon how how much money to blow on development and you can't stream audio to a bluetooth headset in 2016?
 
 Here's some advice. My data will never live in your cloud. Stop designing poor apps thinking it will.",amazon
7/10/2016,"CLUNKY! Yes, it does the trick, but sometimes I get confused as to where to lookay for things. Want to see albums by a certain artist? okay, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!
 
 It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.
 
 Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.
 
 The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is).",amazon
6/5/2015,"this app needs work, especially if you use the Echo app with it, they get confused and sometimes the Amazon Music app will fail to work. The only fix I've found is to reboot the phone, simply killing the app and restarting doesn't work. This is on a Moto X running Android.",amazon

I just wanted the free version and not have to pay so for this feature you do have to listen to ads. I don't mind because it is worth it. Pandora is so great that I went online and ordered two portable speakers so I can really hear my music as loud as I like. I can hear it on my iphone, Kindle, laptop and now on my computer at work. It's great to have your favorite music playing in the background while you work. No radio to have to keep up with and find a empty outlet. Pandora you rock and this is from a 63 year old grandmother who loves her music!",pandora
11/30/2013,"A friend just recently told me about Pandora and I think it's terrific.....I just hope they don't make it mandatory to subscribe! If that happens, they'll lose me.",pandora
3/5/2013,A friend of mine had this app on her phone and I didn't even know what it was. I thought it was awesome and downloaded it onto my kindle. Very neat and easily able to be customized.,pandora
1/16/2013,"A friend recommended this app as a must have for my new fire, so i figured I would give it a try. It's a nice enough app but wasn't what I was lookaying for at all. If you are lookaying for a BASIC music selection then this might work for you, if you have more eclectic tastes then I would suggest TuneIn (another free app)
 Why?
 First TuneIn is easier to navigate with a simple home page to start you off.
 Second right from the start you can see the wider variety of options available to you.
 TuneIn presents you with 4 main choices - TALK, SPORTS, LOCAL RADIO, & MUSIC
 Just sticking with the music sections for comparative purposes Pandora gives you 23 ""genres"" and TuneIn 25 -
 I know what you're thinking - not that big a difference right? That's what I thought too on my first glance - but when you check closer you see how really lacking Pandora is. Since my main interest in an internet radio was the ability to access stations from around the world I will compare this ""genre"".
 1 of Pandora's 23 genres is ""World"" - click on it and you are presented with .... wait for it.... Reggae, Contemporary Bollywood, Celtic, Dancehall, Worldbeat, Hawaiian, Classic Bollywood, Dub, African Essentials, Ska, Contemporary Reggae, Indian Classical, Cajun
 YUP 13 channels. Let's start by lookaying for some Jpop - no Asian choices so let's go with ""worldbeat"" right? Silly person that I am, I assumed that when you clicked on ""worldbeat"" you would be presented with more options to narrow down where in the world you would like to listen to right? WRONG. Click the Worldbeat channel and it just starts playing songs from around the world. Nice I guess, but not what I was lookaying for.
 In comparison click TuneIn's ""World"" genre and - well lookay at that - the world's a little bit bigger than we thought!
 TuneIn gives you 37 regions of the world to help narrow down your choice (such as Africa, Arabic, Caribbean, Dutch, German, Irish, Japanese, Native, Polish, Romanian, Turkish & Vietnamese just to name a few!decide you want to search by language? That's not a problem either!) Let's get the Jpop started by clicking ""Japanese"". Had this been the case I would have been more than satisfied! But wait? What is this?? click on Japanese and you will get this - ""Results 1 - 25 of about 257"" Wait?? You mean ALL Japanese music is not the same?? You are offered a range of stations from actual radio stations in Japan, to streaming internet stations such as a station from Herndon, VA(apparently nothing is better when you are snowed in then a little anime and jpop top 40!). Now just like your local community station on TV isn't going to compare to ABC or NBC, sometimes it IS what you are lookaying for.
 Both apps include commercials (which didn't bother me on either)
 A con for TuneIn is that sometimes the stations are not available, but with the large selection this isn't much of a setback. TuneIn will also suggest similar stations if the one you want is currently unavailable. (Please note- I wasn't on Pandora enough to know if it occurs there as well.)
 TuneIn also offers features like a sleep function and an alarm setting (If Pandora has them they I didn't find them.)
 So overall, while I think Pandora is a fine app I really like the versatility of TuneIN.",pandora
12/31/2011,A friend recommended this app. I am always lookaying for good and different music. This app fills the bill. It does not repeat music over and over like the radio.,pandora
2/10/2013,"A friend turned me on to this............can't believe I just discovered it. I listen to it on my computer, Kindle Fire, phone........what more could I ask for. So versatile. It has literally changed my listening life and introduced me to artists I had not heard of.",pandora
2/5/2013,A frustrating app at times. It will occasionally pop up an overly that demands you either give the song its showing a thumb up or a thumb down. The only way to regain control of the app with out giving a thumb up or a thumb down is to exit the app and restart it. Very annoying. Paying for premium does not give unlimited skips like Spotify does.,pandora
4/28/2016,A game for my granddaughter's tablet.,pandora
8/23/2015,"A good app to get lots of music. A few too many ads perhaps but that's the trade-off for ""free."" The ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" feature is also helpful to keep getting music that you want. Has everything I wanted including 60/70/80, classical, and ""old fogey"" music.",pandora
10/10/2016,"A good app, but advertising keeps it from being a great one. I have a gripe about some of the music on my one station is too old for the genre.",pandora
4/5/2013,A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.,pandora
9/6/2012,"A good free program except for the commercials. I realize that they are necessay and that there is a Pandora One program tha is commercial free, however, it would be nice if the would tell you the cost of the program before a person signs up for the trial period. I am always concerned when I sign up for something not knowing what the ultimate cost will be if you deicde to keep the program.",pandora
10/15/2015,A good music app. Lot& lots of music. To choose. From,pandora
6/14/2016,"a good product and good background music for work and play, able to select the type and kind of music you want to listen to instead of letting the radio station or DJ of that station to choose for you, more control of the music you want to hear and when you want to hear, to fit your mood at times. Unfortunately, the subscriptions can be costly if your taste is broad and wants it more than one genre, or one type of music station.",pandora
3/13/2013,A good selection of music at no or low cost. I would recommend it to anyone.,pandora

I recently switched from ""some"" commercials to the lower of two commercial free options. All 3 are good to listen to, but I think I will be at this ""mid-level"" of service for some time to come.

10/24/2013,Actual free endless music,pandora
6/5/2015,"Actually pay for the subscription, so I must be a fan. A few minor problems - they apparently make no attempt to ""normalize"" the levels, leading to significant changes from track to track. And too often, especially with live tracks, the heads and tails are just abruptly clipped, which can be jarring. Also, while they do seem to take 'thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" seriously, the play lists are narrow; listening for a full day will often produce a lot of replays, with too few ""deep tracks"", just the same old popular cuts.
 But reliability has been good, and sound quality perfectly satisfactory, other that what was mentioned above",pandora

The others regularly would lose their connection and take a long time to reconnect to the internet (if they'd reconnect at all). Pandora seems to have a very strong connection.

 it got continuously worse, sometimes shutting down the app completely, other times leaving me sitting listening to silence which eventually turned into nothing.
 I tried to reach them -they have NO PHONE NUMBER-i emailed them, per their instructions as being the only way to communicate with them.
 I expressed my dissatisfaction in the product that they were now charging me for, especially in light of the flawless experience I had enjoyed as a non-paying customer. I stated that I had uninstalled the app from my phone already, but that i hadn't cancelled the service yet, because before i severed ties completely i wanted them to refund me every penny they had taken for a product they'd never delivered. Granted it was only 4 or 5 dollars at that point, but i don't have extra dollars to throw into the wind and they didn't deserve that money@all.
 Long story short - i am busy and before too long, some other nightmare in my life tookay center stage, and I only realized that Pandora had NEVER EVEN REPLIED to my email, until..... you guessed it! i noticed the charge on my credit card again the other day!
 aarrgghhh!!!!!!
 so, thanks alot Pandora for your upgraded product, PANDORA NONE!

2/10/2014,"As far as the app goes its not bad, though I cant really say I dig the whole pandora thing",pandora
2/15/2014,as good as promised.,pandora
11/9/2014,"As great a resource for music lovers Pandora is, some things aren't as great. For example, the first thing you want to hear on johnny cash radio is not the whatshisface impersonator guy from the I Walk The Line sound track. And today, it seemed the only Chubby Checkers, The Twist track miss Pandora could find was from THE SON OF MASK SOUNDTRACK!!!!! WHYYYYYIZSSSITLIKETHIS?????",pandora
4/2/2014,"As I downloaded for my 20 year old so I cannot truly give proper feedback. However, I will tell you that she continues to use it after many, many months. She sets it up on a Bluetooth speaker and seems to like it so I will give it 5 stars. If she had problems, it would have definitely been deleted! Hope this somewhat helps.",pandora

 with stoppages like a lot of apps do. I have it on my Kindle, and Google phone.",pandora
11/19/2013,"As long as you have access to the Internet, you will have access to Pandora.com, which has a large database of available tunes. You can decide which genre you want and adjust it to play only what you want to hear. It will, however, make suggestions based upon your preferences. It's almost like owning your own radio station.",pandora
3/17/2014,"As most of you know, Pandora is a must at work! This is one of my favorite apps. Highly recommend.",pandora
4/30/2015,"As music stream services go, this is a good one. I only use the ad-supported version, and I have seen the ads to be very wela placed, and don't interrupt the music so much. The app has helped me find artists I have never heard about, and their music has been a joy to listen.",pandora
4/12/2013,"AS OPPOSED TO INVESTING IN SIRIUS OR XM, PANDORA PROVIDES ME WITH A MUSIC MEDIUM TAILORED TO MY NEEDS. I ENJOY CREATING MY OWN STATIONS FOR LISTENING ENJOYMENT. I CAN USE REGULAR RADIO FOR UP TO THE MINUTE NEWS.",pandora
6/8/2013,"As soon as I found the music I wanted, I selected classic rock, at first you get songs that aren't as good, but as time progresses the software uses the songs you like to play a better selection.",pandora
1/7/2014,"As stated, last update brokaye Pandora completely & now hangs instead of loading. When working I'd give it 5 stars - the alarm feature is particularly a plus & when brokayen it disrupts waking up to Pandora. ..One other thing - Pandora One has promised to work on upgrading stream quality beyond full-blown computers & five years later it's DOA - disappointing.",pandora
4/19/2016,As the title said its okay. its only good because it has free songs. but it didn't let me choose which songs I wanted. and the commercials are really annoying! I suggest songify,pandora

9/25/2012,"At first I loved this and still love parts of it.
 The issue that I have with it is that when I listen to a Station that I have.They are supposed to play music similar the the title of the station I am listening to.... it tends to play music that has nothing to do with the station that I am listening to.
 For example. I have one called ""Loretta Lynn Radio"" She is classic country music .. I have female singers from that era on there... Like Patsy Cline,Kitty Wells,etc....
 SO now some one tell me what Michael Jackson's Thriller have to do with country music. ?? That is one of the songs that they played on the Loretta Lynn Station.",pandora
8/4/2016,At first it works and know it won't even load I can't listen to music anymore if I could I would give it a big fat 0 star it don't even deserve one!! Listen to me don't get it!!!,pandora
10/14/2013,"at first it would not shut off, had to shut down my kindle and restart to have pandora off. that was fixed(majic) but now it will go thru a whole song without making any sound come out of my kindle, unles you pause and un pause, sometimes more than once. i have been using pandira on my blackberry for years without any of these problems. was gonna buy pandora one, but not with the way its acting. i uninstalled and reinstalled, this is your last chance pandora......",pandora
11/28/2012,"At first Pandora was great, I loved it, heard songs I haven't heard since I was young.

Can somebody tell me why?",pandora
2/25/2015,"At first when I got the app for my kindle I loved but now I don't, it repeats the same song over and over again and if you don't like one of the songs you have to thumbs down it for it not to play again.",pandora
7/22/2012,at first when my friend offered it I wasn't sure like almost everything else now adays I thought it would need facebookay or twitter I don't have both gladly. I love Pandora and I'm sure you will to especially. since its free!,pandora
6/2/2012,"At first, I thought Pandora was okayay, pretty good music, infrequent, brief commercials, and free. Then I started to work on it, adding artists until I have the most amazingly eclectic mix of country rock, blues, jazz, Grateful Dead, Beach Boys, and it's still free. Only thing, once in a while, I'll get some schwilly Christmas song dropped in - yo9u have to be sure to exercise the thumbs down if you don't like something. For me, Pandora is just the best!",pandora
4/15/2014,"at first, I thought this app was the best thing ever, especially to listen to k-pop, but then I updated it and now I can't listen to it none stop unless I pay or be limited for every month. I wish I didn't update and am warning you not to, too.",pandora

Although there are several competitors out there including Apple's (a direct shameful pandora rip off that would never have seen the light of day if Steve Jobs were still alive) and I heart radio; Pandora has been around for over a decade and they are simply the best.

1/2/2013,"Being one that is very picky when it comes to music providers, I surprisingly loved Pandora. They have every variety of music genres.

11/24/2012,"Below, you will find my old review for how the App worked on my first gen Kindle Fire. With regards to my Kindle Fire HDX, I would say that performance and functionality have gotten a whole lot better. That said, my taste in music services has changed. I would recommend instead, either Songza or Spotify. Still, Pandora is a pretty solid offering and the app is several times better than it used to be.
 
 ***Old Review 2012***
 This app used to be a good one on the Kindle. Now it plays two songs and just stops. Completely Useless. It's part of the reason why I don't subscribe to avoid having ads. Based on other reviews, they don't seem in a hurry to fix this, so why bother upgrading? Bad Business.
 
 Update (Same day): So after posting this review, I removed the app from my Kindle Fire and then re-downloaded it from the App Store. Now it appears to be working as it used too. So I've changed the rating to reflect this.
 
 Another Update (Same day): So it appears to play the songs without any problem, but when an ad pops up, the app just stops and you have to quit and relaunch to get it going again. So even a reinstall won't fix this. I'll reiterate as mentioned before, Bad Business!",pandora

7/19/2017,"Besides the fact that they get you in then prod you to step up to paying they stream good music for the most part. New artists or seldom heard artists are appreciated when they get your taste in music down and I have a quite a diverse taste in music, the tunes roll in.",pandora

 + Free! Who doesn't like free?!
 + High quality sound. Even with a weak signal, Pandora plays like these songs are stored in my phone.
 + A wide variety of stations to choose from. Rock, country, hip hop, R&B, jazz, classical, electronic, disney, and even music from movies! Also by year, the 70s, 80s, 90s, latest hits, Pandora has it all.
 + Create your own group of music. If you only favor a few bands, even from different genre, you can combine them in a group so it will only play the type that you enjoy listening.
 + Thumb up and down system. If there is a song you like, thumb it up and it will play more often or more of the same artist. Thumb down and it will never be played again.
 + Alarm clock! With the latest update Pandora offers your favorite station as your alarm clock. This will ensure to get you moving and not hit that snooze button!
 + No commercial or interruption! This could just be me, I use the same account for my mobile device and my pc. When I listen on my pc there is zero commercial. On my phone however there is ads once in awhile. Not sure what triggers it. But the ads are always short and happens every few songs.
 
 Give it a try and you won't regret it. I have been using this for years and even after trying others, I prefer Pandora.",pandora

 Connection has been good with my T-Mobile 4G network. It usually buffers for 10 seconds and the song fully plays. I've experienced no hiccups with this app. It may depend on your network, location, and signal strength
 
 The interface is very user-friendly. There is a full size image for the song/artists and then the familiar bottom bar -thumbs up, thumbs down, pause, stations, and next. On the top right corner, there is an ""i,"" which lets you read a short description on the artist and the option to lookay at the lyrics.
 
 For the most part, the music is of good quality. Playing the pandora music through my headphones and car speakers, highs and lows are still distinct. It's not the best, but definitely passes for radio quality.

12/18/2014,"Edit: Found an update which wasn't showing up when I wrote the original review, actually had to search for Pandora in the app store, rather than just lookaying at my app downloads (which brought me to the Pandora app page in the store, but all it said was ""open"" and not ""update""), in order to be able to download the update. Sound quality is fixed, but the song name still doesn't change when the song does.
 
 Original Review: Audio quality sounds terrible compared to my 2012 KFHD7, I use High Quality in both devices. App does not display the new song title when the song changes. Videos on mobile YouTube sound 10x better than this version of the Pandora App. App needs to be fixed, as it is not playing high quality audio and is not updating the name of the song.",pandora
7/7/2017,"EDIT: Inexplicably, I was finally able to get the app to work, but I don't understand how. It wasn't showing up in my BlackBerry World list of installed apps, though there was an icon on the home screen. So, I went to the Amazon App Store, from which I had installed the app, and acted like I wanted to install it again. It told me that I already had installed the app...and then the app opened. I logged in and listened to a few minutes of music, then closed the app. I expected not to be able to re-launch the app, but lo and behold, it launched fine. I then went to BlackBerry World to recheck the list of installed apps and Pandora still wasn't listed, perhaps because it was installed via the Amazon App Store. Regardless, I'm upping my stars from two to four.
 
 I am a daily Pandora user on Android devices, smart TVs, etc., and want to be able to use it on my BlackBerry Classic. It installed, but will not launch. If anyone has tips on how to get Pandora to work on a BlackBerry Classic running OS 10.3.2.556, I'm all ears!",pandora

1/4/2015,"Either the upgrade to 1.7.1 or some change on the hosting side caused the audio to lose all the highs. I thought my tweeters were busted at first but no, every other audio application sounds fine. The music barely sounds like it's in stereo any longer. And why would a music player need to read my phone state (which includes the phone numbers of who is calling). Pandora is going the way of Netflix, losing customers by dropping service quality.",pandora

 I will recommend Pandora to all my friends.",pandora

9/17/2014,"First let me start by saying I think this has been improved from a few years ago because I had it on a previous phone and it did not always work properly. On my latest phone, I have not had any issues whatsoever. I love the fact that a person can create their own stations and I feel that Pandora does a good job of choosing music based upon my likes and dislikes. Pandora is used all the time at my house. I do have the free version, which has occasional ads. However, the ads are few enough that it does not bother me. If ads do annoy a person, then an ad free version of the app can be purchased.",pandora
1/15/2016,First pan Dora!!! That's so bad for little kids yeah go hit Dora with a pan!!! Really u have to create an account that sucks!!!,pandora

12/13/2014,"Five star rating for excellence in music. Two things I would recommend though. 1.) Don't put adds on, even if you haven't upgraded to pro yet. This will help us enjoy worshiping the Lord, and having our minds focused on Him. 2. ) I suggest that you have more song selections for an artist, instead of switching to different artists on their radio. For example, if Phil Wickham has more albums out, could his station just play more of those, instead of just one or two? That's my thoughts. Otherwise I would give it a five star rating because of its easy access, availability to access different stations and the superb bookaymarks as well. Thanks for your free service Pandora, I will have to say though that your Christian stations are the best! :)",pandora
2/18/2015,Five stars,pandora
4/23/2015,"Five stars easy, the music and other programs offered on Pandora are what I enjoy listening too. Also they don't have signal drop and now I have it on my Kindle Fire, I am able to move around and listen before I select the programing I want. AOL radio doesn't work more than half the time and I have gotten an on screen message several times saying to try again later, when I do, still nothing. Pandora is good listening and I really don't mind the comms that are a part of the free programing either.

1/13/2017,Five stars!,pandora
8/21/2017,Fix it and I'll change my review.,pandora
2/12/2016,"For a free product, Pandora does a fantastic job of allowing you to choose your favorite types of music and picking similar styles so as to let you hear a variety of music artists. Once I choose my artist stations it also allows for a shuffling of stations. I believe I could listen for three days straight without hearing the exact same song.
 Pandora is a great site..............Everyone should take advantage of it.",pandora
1/27/2013,For anyone who uses this service on other devices it works pretty much the same here . I have had no trouble with it .,pandora

1/30/2014,"For Christmas, 2015, I received a great gift of a Kindle Fire tablet, as well as a really nice headset.. I recently discovered Pandora and was very pleased with the site.

12/21/2014,"For main words: Three Dog Night Radio!!!
 
 Oh my goodness, I am loving this app! I can't get enough of it. The ads don't really bug me. They're reasonable in length and I find them more tolerable than the raunchy television commercials.",pandora
1/6/2015,For me sometimes the music skips but it could just be my internet connection. For the most part it's fine.,pandora
12/16/2013,For me the experience has been far too complicated. Too many challenges to upgrade and have not been able use on my car Bluetooth.,pandora
10/24/2014,"For me, this app is the best of music apps.",pandora
1/20/2015,For music streaming Pandora is indispensable. A Large selection of genres and infrequent breaks in streaming make it an enjoyment,pandora
1/17/2014,"for my life span, all the tunes I've listened to, Pandora is awesome!",pandora
10/12/2017,"For my listening genres (electronic new age/relaxation/concentration), the selection seems to be very thin and repetitive. Add to the limited skipping of unwanted selections, it was a no-brainer not to renew this after my year expired. I did discover Ulrich Strauss, for which I'll be eternally grateful :-).",pandora
4/18/2015,For only $36 a year Pandora offers the best music experience across every device imaginable. What more could you want?,pandora
12/13/2011,For some reason every time I try to open this app up it automatically shuts down. Tried reloading it several times still nothing. It has always perfectly up until today. I really like this app. What can I do to fix it?,pandora
4/8/2016,for some reason it won't take my password.,pandora
1/26/2016,For some reason the app doesn't play anything longer than 1 second. I'm going to delete it and add it again to see if that fixes the problem,pandora
7/12/2016,"For some reason, I think I am being charged to use Pandora. I thought it was free.",pandora
6/14/2015,for someone like me I love music and I went on Pandora all the time but now it wont let me in the app. serious problem needs to be fixed,pandora
4/27/2014,"For something that touts itself as internet radio, it's customization options are ridiculously limited. One might assume that, since it asks you to enter an artist's name to create your own personalized radio station, that you will be listening to that artist on said station. Not so. You will listen to 1 song by that artist and then a whole bunch by people you've likely never heard of and that have nothing to do with the artist you entered. If it allowed you to enter artists you want to hear songs by and then actually played songs by those artists, and *only* those artists, I would no doubt give it a higher rank. The commercals and skip limits just make it all the worse. In short, if you are picky about your music, lookay elsewhere. This isn't going to give you many real options for customizing your personal ""station"".
 
 Signed, Pamela T.",pandora
11/17/2011,For the past 3 days the app will open but the music won't play and I can't do anything like try to pause and unpause it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still won't work!

11/23/2013,Free is a great price. Music selections are very good. I've run across several likable pieces I'd never heard before. I completely recommend this music service.,pandora
1/7/2013,"Free is a relative term. What price is ""free""dom? In the case of Pandora's app the price is getting an annoying pop-up ad box in the center of the display virtually every 2 seconds. The curse, if you don't upgrade you will be haunted by never ending ads until time immemorial. Given that ad curse, you might think that they'd only deliver the Blues. But, to be fair, there are considerably more music genres to choose from. Hence the 2nd star. We each have different patience levels. You have to decide what you are willing to put up with ad-wise for the free app. Just know what you're getting into.",pandora

6/8/2015,Good music app. You are able to create a profile and start listening right away without having to download each song. You are able to pick an artist or genre and it gives you a variety of music. You can pick anything from smooth jazz to lil wayne. There a few short ads that pop up in between songs. You are able to skip I think 5 or 6 at a time if you don't want to hear it at the moment. This app learns your tastes and will suggest songs or remove ones you didn't like from your playlist. I like that you can even listen to comedy skits or holiday music. If you are lookaying for a good music app this is it.,pandora

12/24/2014,"Good music player... for things not on the local device. Everything is streamed. For some, this is awesome. For others with already extensive collections, it is redundant at best.
 
 Then, there's the randomness. You start with some single song or artist, or maybe even a vague genre as a base and it randomly tries to figure out what (based on music DNA) you might like related to that baseline. And trying to teach it some of the most-simple things like ""I hate this artist, in total"", just seem to be beyond the comprehension of the app.
 
 Not horrible. But plenty of room for improvement.",pandora

3/12/2013,"Hmmm,???? I don't remember buying this. It must have come as a free app on my phone. Guess I'll have to check it out.",pandora
8/16/2015,Hmmmm I think that this is a good app but when you want to go back sometimes it will not let you go but other than that it is a really cool app :),pandora
4/5/2017,Honestly I hardly ever use it.,pandora
1/12/2013,Honestly it's a good app for music. But...... it does have its flaws. It might stop or daddy forward to another song. But other than that it's awesome!!!,pandora
3/4/2015,"Honestly the only downside to this is that sometimes....you just want to listen to music from the artist you chose. At least I do. However, I normally enjoy the music that's being played anyway. So no biggy.",pandora

9/2/2016,How are you people saying finally Pandora for Android? It's been on the Android Market since I got my first Android phone at leasttt 2 yrs ago. And if you're complaining that Amazon doesn't update as frequently as you want maybe you should get apps that require updates a lot from the actual stock market. Pandora is a great app just like the amazon market,pandora
9/17/2016,How can you go wrong it's free and you can program it to play only what you like and after a while it understands what your preferences are. Instead of buying the music you can simply create your own station that you want to hear.,pandora

7/15/2013,How can you not like pandora?,pandora

4/9/2013,how come other pandora apps are commercial free? i mean did you guys lose a contract or what AD-free please.,pandora
11/6/2016,"How could anyone NOT love Pandora? I really like that I can select all the music I enjoy and then similar music is added. I can give a thumbs up or down to keep only what I enjoy. The ads are minimal and not irritating. I listen to this when I want to get things done around the house, prepare dinner, or just relaxing. Thank you, Pandora!!!",pandora
11/18/2013,How could anything free be any better? I believe this is worth paying for if the adds bother you. You will find similar music to what you select and may find artists you were not aware of.,pandora
11/30/2013,how could you not love all this music for free. somehow though my channels always seem to lean heavily toward the Beatles but still awesome app.,pandora

7/10/2015,How great to be able to listen to music I enjoy. It has introduced me to new artists which I will enjoy hearing from in the future.,pandora
1/4/2014,"How long have I been listening to Pandora? Since before it WAS Pandora and it was MSN Music, that's how long ago I've been a fan! I realize that there are other streaming music channels out there but when you achieve perfection, WHY switch?
 
 Thanks to Pandora, my work and personal life is so much richer. I have over 52 different channels on Pandora, from Patti Page, to Lionel Hampton, Pink Martini, Nils Frahm, Windham Hill, to 5 different Christmas stations (which I'm embarrassed to admit, I listen to throughout the year!). I have learned SO much more about the different genres that I enjoy, from Pop, Jazz, Blues, Alternative, Classical that Pandora should proudly take a bow, just on the education factor!
 
 If you go just a hare's breath beyond the standard listening feature, there's a wee box of ""arrows"" that you click so you can find out 1) Lyrics to most songs; 2) About the Artist; 3) WHY Pandora is using that particular artist i.e. ""Accoustic rhythm piano; intricate phrasing."" You also have the ability to ""Bookaymark"" any song that you like, so you don't have to scramble for a pen/paper to remember ""Who WAS that awesome artist?""
 
 And, if you take the small effort to ""Thumb's Up/Down"" a song every now and then, Pandora can broaden their knowledge of your music and they add more songs of that ilk to your stations. Thank you, Pandora!
 
 Because I have a Zune membeship, what I do is take my bookaymarked songs/artists and then investigate them further through Zune, usually downloading the entire album. A person can't be everywhere at one time and by listening to Pandora, I discover the ENTIRE world of music, not just the tiny part I know.
 
 And ""Yes!"", I'm a paid member for Pandora.One, a yearly Christmas gift I give myself and Pandora, applauding what they give to me, daily. Frankly, what else can you buy for less than a dime a day that delivers so much? :)",pandora
8/24/2013,How many stars would I give Pandora? All the stars in the sky.,pandora
2/3/2013,"How the heck did I live without you, Pandora?",pandora
9/17/2015,"How wonderful to be able to choose the music of one's choice for anytime playing! A delightful repertoire at one's fingertips! A great opportunity to expand personal musical knowledge through wide exposure.
 
 Thank you, Pandora!",pandora
8/9/2015,How would you like to listen to whatever you would like anytime you wanted and your favorite artist singing everything you want to hear? Get this: It is an eternal music box that plays everything you want to hear. It's amazing!!,pandora
3/19/2014,"However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $36 yearly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""
  That's why I use Milk Music. You pay less only $4.00 per month and you'll get unlimited Skips with no Ads.
  I think I'm going to say with Milk Music.",pandora

1/2/2013,"I absolutely love Pandora! I choose to add the monthly subscription (it's like $3.99 a month) and the subscription is totally worth it. Regular Pandora has occasional ads that you can't skip but with the subscription there are no ads. I use this app every day, I have all my favorite stations trained to play my favorite songs all the time. I have even found new artists and songs I didn't know existed as Pandora will occasionally add a random new song or artist into the mix.",pandora
12/13/2011,"I absolutely love Pandora. I have a massage business and everybody that comes and gets to choose the type of music that they want.

5/9/2017,"I absolutely love this radio. It plays tons of similar tracks that are exactly what i want to listen to. I would recommend it for some one who is more open minded about music, not as specific because it doesnt always play the song that you are wanting to hear, however it might play a song that you dont know that could be better. Its great for some one who is wanting to widen their musical horizons.",pandora

7/20/2012,I actually pay for Pandora one each month so I don't get the commercials. Well worth the $3.99 a month!,pandora
5/5/2013,"I admit that I cannot remember the exact timeframe that I discovered Pandora, but I believe that it was sometime around summer or autumn 2011 when my husband played music from the app during one of our quiet moments together. I enjoy that there is a wide range of stations and music genres that one can listen to. Im open-minded when it comes to willingness to listen to various types of music. Right now, the top three music stations that I am listening to on Pandora the most are chillout, electronica, and indie dance, although I have to humbly credit recently finding out about indie dance from a public relations specialist named heather whaling of geben communication- who listed indie dance being one of their fave stations online. Sometimes I go ahead and also shuffle the over 20 plus radio stations that are set in my Pandora profile in order to listen to satisfy my eclectic tastes in music. Many of my online music purchases have been influenced by many of the songs and artists I heard on Pandora.",pandora
1/4/2014,I adore Pandora and dont even listen to the radio in my car anymore. It is very intuititve based on your like and dislikes and the ads are so short you barely notice them!,pandora

7/19/2012,"I adore this app. I am able to play music when I am on my phone, computer, iPod or Kindle. Pretty much I take the music with me everywhere. There are so many stations that if you can think of it there is probably a station (that type of music) for it. Another feature that I like is that I am able to mark songs that I like or dislike (even skipping them). This makes my playlist more designed for my taste. There are quite a few ads & commercials on the free version that I have but Pandora has another pay version if want to avoid the ads (& some other benefits I not sure about). Give it a try...it's free.",pandora
5/24/2017,I agree with a lot of the users here. It just freezes up now an all I get is a pretty little blue screen that says Pandora!!! I have eve deleted the app an downloaded it again and STILL the SAME THING. So it will stay at one star for me.,pandora
5/9/2015,I agree with everyone but be aware that if you update this app while using kindle fire it will limit your free music to a certain amount of hours per month.,pandora

I get to listen to newer songs by the artists I adore and never have to pay a penny for it(unless I cannot live without the song in question)!

I think there are far less bugs in this version. So, in short, great product that I use daily.",pandora

1/14/2015,"I am an old man. 61 years old to be exact. I have always loved music, and the only way I knew to play it was by putting on a record, or as time went by, a compact disc. Pandora, when I finally discovered it, was a revelation. I could create my own stations...and suddenly my home was filled with Bach, Thomas Newman, Argo Part or when we had guests, an easy listening station. But slowly the app died. It would play one song and refuse to play another. This happened more and more frequently and I finally gave up and downloaded Songa. It works fine. Goodbye Pandora.

12/12/2016,I am going to be subscribing to Pandora One soon. Love the variety and don't need Sirius any more. Pandora has comedy channel and many varied genres.,pandora
1/27/2013,"I am happy now. Now that Pandora's free membership comes with unlimited playback I want Pandora everywhere and, thanks to this, Pandora is on my XOOM now.
 
 Pandora is elegant and flawless on Honeycomb. The screen is less cluttered than the PC version with nothing but the album cover, the thumbs up/down icons, an 'info' button that opens up artist and song info screens and the playback controls. I like that option to blank the screen while layback continues. And Pandora keeps playing while other apps are in use - tried it with the browser and a couple of games.
 
 The Android settings menu allows you to tweak a few parameters:
 
 - Play quality high/normal
 - Auto screen lock on/off
 - Auto shutdown in low memory situations
 - Bluetooth on/off
 
 It's perfection (with some ads popping up).

4/22/2014,I do a lot of late night computer work and the Pandora music program is easy to load and go with lots of options for music genres to switch to since there's lots of repetition from an individual genre.

 Unfortunately, Pandora takes it upon themselves to add other artists that they consider to be of the same genre.

3/2/2017,"I don't have to pay for music anymore . Let . Me tell you . There's a audio recorder app that's for free on my kindle and you can record Pandora music then you can listen to it without WiFi or Pandora cause it immediately downloads on your device.

1/28/2014,I don't know how to play the music and set up the right apps to make it personal. I know younger people can do it without trouble.,pandora
12/25/2013,"I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I sometimes hear the same songs over and over again - in the same order. It's getting a little aggravating, because even though I like those songs, I don't want to hear the same ones in the same order every time I listen to a station. I've only noticed it happening on the Pop Rock radio I have, thankfully. Pandora often offers me a new song when I first click on the station, but it's usually a song I don't like (and I'm not holding that against them, of course). So I'll put a thumbs down. But then I get the same songs all over again. It's quite frustrating.",pandora
3/13/2014,"I don't know if it is this version of Pandora or my Kindle that makes this app take so long to load. I have a solid connection, but it can take five to ten minutes for this to begin playing. I also cannot find any way to close it without turning my Kindle off. I love Pandora on my iBookay, but this version on my Kindle.",pandora

7/19/2012,"I don't know what to say that probably hasn't alreadt been said in praise of PANDORA on mommy KindleFire. Name an artist and voila, you have a ""station "" that will deliver tunes by that artist and similar artist. One caveat, if you listen a lot (and I do) you will soon recognize the limit to the tunes by your rave artist that will repeat. Usually these will be the songs you would expect on a ""greatest hits "" album and often that is exactly where they come from.
 But hey, if you get bored with the repeats, quickly create a new station.
 This app can't. Be beat for a source of tunes for your KindleFire or other aneroid device.",pandora
4/21/2014,I don't know what's going on lately but it will play one song then buffer for eternity. Very disappointing.,pandora
8/4/2012,I don't know what's up with other peoples kindle fire's but it works fine on mine. It never crashes and has good music. The only downside is ads but overall not bad.,pandora

12/29/2013,i dont know why this app needs wifi!!! when i got this app it only played 2 songs and went to commercials!! jango plays more songs w/out wifi( i think) and no commercials!!! i totaly recomend jango and its free!!,pandora

2/20/2013,"I don't listen to local radio because of all the talking and commercials. I've liked Pandora online so I thought I'd try the app. EVERY three songs there is a video commercial and there are constant pop-up ads. Thanks, but no thanks. Uninstalled it.",pandora

6/15/2014,"I don't mind a commercial a few times an hour, it almost like listening to radio - sometimes after 2 songs... I am sorry, but I'm never going to buy a Jeep or Lexus.

11/13/2013,"I don't mind the advertising, the best thing is that I can choose the music that I want to hear. It's one of the best website that have invented.",pandora
12/9/2013,"I don't mind the commercials but wish it would stop asking if you want to download the free version Pandora One. I like the service otherwise, particularly because it includes lyrics for many songs and it learns what type of music you like.",pandora
7/2/2013,I dont mind the station having ads but playing over the top of the songs is very annoying. The old method of playing the ad in between the songs made much more sense. Maybe it is a glitch but I dont really understand what the ad is saying with the song still playing in the background.,pandora
9/6/2013,I don't own my own music library or like to take responsibility for the music I make my friends listen too. Pandora is perfect for my music starved lifestyle.,pandora

4/29/2016,"I don't really mind there being ads but some of them are about sexual enhancement etc. I don't want to be seeing/hearing those certain ads with my family around. the worst part is those types of ads you get while the music is playing, you cant close them! the close button simply does not work and opens the link as if you'd clicked on the ad itself. I understand I'm using the free version of Pandora but there should be a way to disable those types of ads while still being able to listen to my favorite songs that have slight profanity in them. other than that, good app.",pandora

Seems to stop playing after a few hours though and has commercials. When I use on my LG home theater (built into that) it never plays commercials and never quits until I turn it off. Not bad though for a free music radio. I tend to use Songza more often on the Fire HD then this one though.",pandora

Other than that I love it it is the best. Marilyn from Remus, Michigan",pandora

4/25/2013,"I downloaded and installed Pandora on my Kindle Fire. I created a station and everything seemed to work fine. However when I walked away and returned, the station was no longer functioning. Turns out that the ap requires you to interact with it from time to time or it shuts down the station. This stinks! I switched to another streamer that does not require me to be glued to my screen. Pandora better fix this or they will quickly be OBE.",pandora

3/25/2013,"I downloaded this app 6 months ago on my Droid X and recently on my Droid X 2. Both times, I've enjoyed plugging in my phone with an audio jack into my car and surfing my stations. It sucks up battery pretty fast, so I also charge my phone in the car while listening to Pandora. And it only works if you have wifi or 3G available which isn't an issue unless you're driving far out in the countryside.
 I recommend this app and want to mention that I haven't had songs skip or not fully play.
 If I will, I'll update this review.",pandora
5/3/2012,"I downloaded this app and was pleased to see that it has a sleep timer and other features not offered on my nookay app. However, as one reviewer mentioned, it seemed to just lock up when I tried to open it for the second time. What I did was to remove it from my device and reload it everytime I wanted to use it. That was a bit of a hassle, I thought, but yesterday I realized in frustration when it came up with the pandora screen and I just tapped that screen, it opened. Boy, did I feel silly! In my defense, I am over 50 and what is supposed to be ""intuitive"" to many isn't ""intuitive"" to me. Anyway, I'm thrilled that I figured that out and am now able to listen to all my channels on the great speakers on my Kindle Fire HD.

8/18/2014,I downloaded this app for my kindle fire. When I opened it nothing happened. I tried deleting it and re-downloading it - it still did not work. It just shows the opening Pandora screen and never does anything else. Just a tad bit annoying!,pandora
11/20/2012,I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire and was most impressed. I opened the app and started listening to music but had never did anything else while listening to music. So I opened my Ebay app and did some shopping while listening to music that I like on Pandora...totally fabulous!!,pandora

10/16/2013,I downloaded this application for my Kindle to play while I'm at work. There's such a broad range of different music specifically for my taste.

4/9/2014,"I enjoyed reading the bookay. Got it right after seeing the movie, Captain Phillips. I actually enjoyed the movie more because of Tom Hank's acting (last 20 minutes of film was tremendous).

6/21/2014,I enjoyed using this program until they raised the price of the service. It is a one of a kind program because I could develope the music folks I listen to most offen.

5/18/2013,"I even subscribed to the Pandora one over Sirius. $4.99 for Pandora, over $15.00 for Sirius per month. I don't like Howard Stern that much. I like to be able to skip a song if I don't like it, but do not like that this option is limited per day. Got it because my motorcycle radio's reception sucks. Crystal clear and integrates with my motorcycle radio from my iphone through a simple FM transmitter.",pandora

Also I would like to have an alarm with music instead of buying the music feature on other alarm clock apps.,pandora
12/3/2015,I finally found somewhere that plays new music,pandora
9/24/2015,"I finally loaded the Pandora app the other day on advise from my daughter. After reading lots of bad an so - so reviews, I was skeptical, but didn't think my college student would steer me wrong.
 
 I created a variety of stations among different genres and have beenvery happy with all my choices and most of Pandora's too. I haven't had to give many thumbs down. Even stations I've created that I thought would be just to try out, have become some of my faves!
 
 The brief commercial breaks aren't a problem at all.
 
 If you are on the fence like I was at first, give it a try, I believe you will get addicted like I have.",pandora
10/1/2014,"I find I don't use it much. I have the free version, if that makes a difference in the review.",pandora

I get awesome tunes while sunning at my pool what could be better! Thanks Pandora!,pandora
3/24/2015,"I find it fun to listen to. It does use up your battery pretty fast though. Also, is regularly skips songs when I don't want it to. Also, it signed me up for pandora one all by itself and I don't know how to get out.",pandora
6/14/2014,"I find Pandora media service to be my most used app on my smartphone. I can listen to ""Classical Study"" while I read, do projects and study online or at my desk. I find it helpful that Pandora feeds me with so many different selections, I never get bored. It is like a radio station just for my style.
 
 Sincerely, David Hall",pandora
5/2/2015,I find Pandora to be most exellant especially late at night,pandora
1/12/2014,I find Pandora very helpful.,pandora
10/23/2015,"I find that this is kind of clunky to use. I like the Amazon Music app better. I can find albums on the Amazon app. I still have not figured out how to access albums on Pandora. So, it's okayay. Not the greatest, not the worst.",pandora
6/20/2016,"I find that when you create a radio station that the same songs play over and over again. In my case I created several 'radio stations' based on performers such as Simon & Garfunkel. I know S & G have recorded many songs but only heard three or four of them along with a lot of other performers music that was of only marginal interest to me. If you skip too many songs - you get a message that is not allowed as often as you like.
 
 I also found over the two months I tried using it that most of the music was from albums recorded at 'live' events, I prefer the higher quality studio songs - I don't seem to have any choice in the issue. No longer using Pandora.",pandora
9/26/2016,"I find the loop of music too short. I only received my Kindle about 2 weeks ago and am already getting lots of repeat songs, which shouldn't be happening so soon with all the zillions of songs out there. Also, when I click on the Beatles station, I get a lot of music before Beatles music happens. Yes, I'm on shuffle, but I thought when I was on a station, I'd hear at least a lot of that music. But the short loop is my primary dissatisfaction. I haven't updated to the no-advertisement membership because I don't mind them. I thought perhaps if I did upgrade, I'd get a longer time between repeat songs, but that's not what no-ads means, so I'm not sure that would solve the problem.",pandora
2/13/2015,I find the music selections much like iheart. I enjoy having both because I have a choice of which radio to listen to.,pandora
11/29/2014,I find the product very user friendly with very few commercials and the ability to choose the genre of music that you like,pandora
7/9/2015,I find the songs I like and enjoy I really recommend this to you get it it so free I RECOMMEND IT REAL BAD,pandora
12/28/2012,"I first discovered PANDORA through my work, but now I listen to it at home too through my Kindle Fire and my blue-ray player. Love It!",pandora
6/8/2013,"I first started using Pandora on my laptop. Having it loaded on my Android smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD is even better. Able to play my stations in the kitchen the bedroom, the car and anywhere is fabulous. The user interface is good and easy to figure out. The only issue I have is that the touch buttons are so small on the screen it is hard to hit them accurately. For example, the X that you use to close an advertisement and the menu to quit or change stations. But other than that, it works like a charm. I am a big fan of Pandora as a way to listen to music.",pandora
7/16/2013,I found all my old music.,pandora
9/27/2013,"I found it hard to navigate and find a particular song. Also, I didn't expect it to use data charges when I play it through the app on my car.",pandora
4/7/2017,"I found Pandora to be of no value. If i had paid for it i would feel cheated.
 The promise of liustening only to music i like is a lie.
 The stuff they offered when i asked for Mozart was stuff I would never even classify as the same genre. I can't even imagine what genre that stuff was part of. Very disappointed!
 I've uninstalled it. I might try spotify (?) or some other music app.
 Very disappointed!
 If i could i would give it a rating of minus stars ! ! !
 VERY DISAPPOINTED ! ! !",pandora
9/8/2014,i found some very funny comedy type channels and era specific ones that cater to my 80's hair band and late 70's self. mitch hedberg radio is friggin' funny! Great app!,pandora
8/12/2017,I found the inability to skip unwanted tracks simply unacceptable. Program was deleted. Amazon says I didn't use enough words so I added this sentence.,pandora
10/2/2012,I found this app to be very helpful. Now whenever I am bored I can just listen to my favorite song's!!,pandora
10/18/2013,I fully recommend this app. I enjoy having the personalized radio feel and don't like how you have to pay for the mobile with apps like spotify.,pandora

11/25/2013,"I gave pandora a 5 I really love so much variety and the commercials are quick, i recommend this app",pandora

1/8/2013,I gave this a 5 star rating because whatever band/artist/song I type in it matches other artists and songs perfectly! I use Pandora all the time! I would highly recommend it.,pandora
6/19/2014,I gave this music app five stars because of the wide range of stations and diversity of songs provided and unlike YouTube when you leave the app the songs don't stop they continue to play. One good thing about Pandora is that the adds aren't as bad they don't show up a lot. Thanks Pandora for the best free music app anyone has to offer,pandora

I logged in to just hear one song, and I stayed on for an hour b/c the other songs were songs I liked...I had to force myself to shut it down so I could get some sleep and get ready for work in the morning.",pandora

5/16/2013,"I give 4 stars, the only thing are the ad pop-ups.",pandora
5/27/2013,I give it 3 stars because the music and playlists are good but the commercials are terrible! You can download other apps that don't have any commercials that are just as good if not better.,pandora
2/20/2015,"I give it 5 stars because I can't give it 6! If I'm listening to music, it is on Pandora!",pandora

12/22/2012,"I give it a two at best. On Android the app rarely if ever works right and more often than not you get a popup that says ""Pandora can't find any more music, try changing channels"" on every single channel even letting Pandora choose one. And on the web it's recently become totally unusable as it now plays ads THROUGH the music nonstop. And it's it's same stupid ad for some health insurance company over and over over and over. Might be time to kiss this one goodbye. Lookays like Pandora just got too greedy.",pandora
7/2/2013,I give it an A +,pandora
12/30/2014,I give Pandora 5 stars but you guys need to get involved with the independent artists and the unsigned artist,pandora
8/10/2014,I give Pandora a 5 because it's so easy and to me the best music of all time all categories. Thank you Pandora.,pandora
3/3/2016,I give Pandora a five star rating because of it offers such a wide variety of music! I actually do not mind the commercials because they are not run close together and it makes it feel like the old radio days. I would recommend Pandora to everyone!,pandora
1/20/2017,"I give this a 5 star rating because I am really stuck to music, and it is free!!! I can create new stations. But the big deal is adds. Every song I play, I leave my fire on my bed and listen to an add, and another one comes on. UUUUURRRRRGGGGG!!!!! So I almost put a 4 star rating.????. But my ?? (heart) told me not to. So I didn't. I told my mom last night I wish that there were NO adds in the world. But I have really great station's like Dove Camron or Ariana Grande.",pandora
5/22/2014,I give this a 5 star rating because I can pick the music I want to hear and there are not very many ads. This is a great idea! Glad I got the app.,pandora

7/27/2017,"I got email asking for 6 month trial for the top of the line super duper (where when you ask for a song, you actually get that song) - and it doesn't work that way on my lap top, and it didn't convert to my phone/tablet - I now get advertisements for the same thing there. How many $9.99's do they want from me?",pandora
4/23/2015,I got it then was told it didn't work in this country before I could even start. I don't know if it is good of bad but if u don't live in the USA then don't bother getting it.,pandora
7/28/2017,I got on the app thinking it was awesome. Then it asked me for Facebookay information!!! Don't waste your time,pandora
9/2/2012,I got Pandora on my cell phone; and it STINKS. I can never get it to stop and it plays songs that I didn't request. There are SO many ads. I uninstalled it.,pandora
6/8/2015,I got rid of Pandora on my Kindle Fire HD. Just couldn't take all the ads. Same problem with a Kindle Fire in general.,pandora
8/22/2012,"I got the free app, but it wouldn't open and instead the blue pandora screen just sat there for about 5 minutes before I got annoyed and closed the app...any ideas?",pandora
7/5/2013,"I got the free version and decided to upgrade to Pandora One. The commercials eventually got to me and I couldn't take it anymore. Enough about that. I have really enjoyed making stations and listening to music I would play if I had it, much of which I do own now. The links to buy the music make it simple to expand your collection.
 I like being able to insert comments and read what others think about the songs and artists.
 I got this app for my Mom's i-pad and it doesn't have half the flexibility as the one for the Kindle. I even got her Pandora One thinking it would add more usefulness, it didn't.
 My only complaint is there is only three ratings for the songs; like (thumbs up), dislike (thumbs down), and neutral (do nothing). I wish there was a really, really, really (you get the idea) like the song.",pandora
9/3/2013,"I got the free version of Pandora and am loving this Pandora music experience, I listen to music via Pandora rather than the radio now because it is able to select music that I like. I can give it thumbs up or thumbs down to each music and Pandora will remember my preference.",pandora
1/21/2013,i got the upgrade and now pandora won't load. i got slacker and i love it. i liked pandora but after the upgrade it doesnt work.,pandora
9/7/2013,I got the upgrade was charged for it and still got are you listening,pandora
3/14/2012,"I got this app and it works great, but once I get on the app I have to wait 10 min for it to load!! I would recommend spotify, because you can litsen to music you actually search for, and Pandora when I search for a song the real song does not come on it is a completely different song then what I search for therfor GET SPOTIFY",pandora
8/24/2017,I got this app because I always use Pandora on my other devises when I am useong that device some of my kids use it. I do like this app i only gave it 4 stars because it is kinda hard to navigate this app on the Kindel Fire.,pandora
8/7/2015,"I got this app for my Kindle and Android phone and now I have music everywhere I go. It's much better than radio. ""Reception"" is crystal clear and it has less (a lot less!) commercials than radio. Commercial interruptions are tolerable and the content of the commercials are even relevant sometimes. And if you're willing pay a monthly subscription fee (currently 4.99, up from 3.00 when it was introduced in 2009), you get advertising-free music. Last, I shouldn't forget to mention that if you have T-Mobile (I do), music streaming on Pandora doesn't count towards your data usage. SWEEEET!",pandora
12/26/2013,I got this app for my Kindle Fire HDX. The app works great and it is just want I needed.,pandora
2/6/2015,I got this app for my T301 and it's AWESOME! I can jam to the radio all day long for FREE!,pandora

1/24/2012,"I Got this programfrom nt computer on Sunday night and as Tues night I have yet to see it on my Kindle, I like it on my computer just did not think that it would take so long to down load.",pandora
2/18/2012,"I got this so I could integrate my smart TV with my android tablet and use my tablet as a remote for the radio, and it does exactly what it is supposed to. I particularly enjoy being able to put in the artist or song and up it pops, though I get bored pretty quickly when the same type of music keeps coming. Still, it's a must have for those who enjoy 'listening' to radio!",pandora
1/1/2013,"I got this spp back in the days of the first iPhone, now it really stinks. In order to get the service I got for free, it now costs 5 dollars a month or put up with ads thst are worse than commercial tv when infomercials are on.",pandora
10/18/2013,I got this to listen to music around the house. Good selection of music genres.,pandora
8/21/2014,"I got this to replace the I Heart Radio until they release a compatible app for my device. The downside, though, is that it doesn't have the radio station I like to listen.",pandora
4/15/2016,"I got to use it once and it worked great, but I opened it up again and it just hand a Pandora sign. The screen didn't change. I think it's great but only when it works.",pandora
2/24/2013,"I guess after you get good with it, it may be good. Until then it is quite difficult.",pandora
9/12/2013,I guess I'll be canceling. App won't open.,pandora
1/7/2017,I guess it is okay but if you are hoping for a really good music app go to iheartradio,pandora
3/28/2016,"I guess that's the point of free versus subscription service, but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer-based commercials, now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating, to say the least.",pandora
2/13/2016,"I guess. I could never get it to work, so I deleted it from my kindle. I have not tried it lately.",pandora
12/10/2012,"I had 2 stations, and none of the songs would play. Advertisements worked as well as commercials, but the songs wouldn't play, and would switch after a couple of minutes as if they did. Tried restarting a couple of times and that didn't work. Ridiculous.",pandora
1/23/2015,"I had a Pandora account on my old phone and decided I wanted it again on my new one. I like the music selection
 On Pandora.",pandora

2/25/2014,"I had Pandora apps on several devices for a few years. Lately, its gotten better. I've noticed no commercials and better matching with ""like"" music. My stations are awesome. I sometimes forget I'm listening to Pandora and not a playlist I made.",pandora
10/8/2013,"I had Pandora before and it was good. However, because it kept pausing when I tried listening to music I liked, I will give a low rating!!! That will teach them!",pandora
6/20/2013,I had Pandora on my Ipod but when I went to put it on my kindle it asked for my password. I wasn't sure if I had had a separate pass word for Pandora. Was it my password for Amazon? This was confusing so they did not load it onto my kindle however they seem to think it is on. I am not sure how to go about getting it now. I do like Pandora on my Ipod,pandora
7/19/2014,"I had previously downloaded Pandora for my computer and found its music selections far superior to another free Internet source. I then upgraded to Pandora/One to take advantage of higher fidelity and eliminate ads. When I found I could get a Pandora download for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 "" I jumped at the chance. With the free app from Amazon I now have two sources for quality music: a fixed desktop computer and a mobile Fire tablet.",pandora

6/7/2013,I had the app before and stopped using it. Just got back on and it's better but the purpose of creating a certain artist station is to only listen to that artist. I hear music completely different from the artist,pandora
1/26/2013,"I had this app before,about 5 to 6 months ago,but now it won't work. I open the app and it just puts me at the loading screen and nothing else,I waited about 10 minutes and it didn't work. Please fix this,thanks for listening.",pandora
8/1/2013,"I had this app for the longest time but just recently when I open the app and select a station, songs continually pop-up (not playing them) they just pop-up and don't stop until I close the app. I don't know if it's just my kindle or the app.",pandora
9/9/2013,I had this app on my phone and it's amazing as any other form of Pandora radio. I didn't see it on here for a while so I experimented with other apps but I would much rather use Pandora!,pandora
8/7/2015,I had to go back to an old version to just get it to work. Still very sketchy using that. Takes a minute to load the first song then twenty seconds to over a minute to play the next song. Do you call that quality? Because I don't. I've had better luck using Slacker. Droid X2,pandora
2/16/2014,I had to pay $36.00 per year but it was worth it. i recomended to anyone you have music every where you go.,pandora
11/10/2011,"I had to uninstall because it kept saying my session timed out when I wasn't even listening. I even restarted device before uninstalled.

6/1/2015,I have a complaint. . . My Elvis Presley channel plays one to two of Elvis songs in a hour. I hear more Waylon and Johnnie cash than Elvis. The same goes for all the other channels I set. Why set up your favorite artists when you play what you want?,pandora

7/4/2016,"I have a paying account with Pandora on my desktop computer, and have had one for years. I don't like the blasts of 15-second ads you have to put up with when you have a free account. I was delighted to learn I could put Pandora on my iPhone. That app is free, so you can't beat the price! I have the iPhone with me everywhere, which I definitely cannot say about my desktop, so with this app I am using Pandora far more than I ever did before.
 
 As for Pandora itself, I like that I can set up many different ""channels,"" and Pandora will play a constant stream of similar types of music within a given channel. I can also change channels anytime I like. I often play a channel with rousing music first thing in the morning to wake me up, and a channel with soothing music while preparing for bed.",pandora

5/5/2013,"I have been a long time user of Pandora on the web, blackberry and Android. Recently this app has not been allowing me to hear entire songs. a song will start and play for a short amount of time before abruptly skipping to the next.

11/13/2011,"I have been a longtime Pandora One subscriber. Until recently, I have made the jump to Sirius XM satellite radio. Why? Much more variety. Not to mention 160+ live channels. All music channels can be catered to the end user's taste with MyXM it has 6 skips an hour limit, but doesn't make me feel bad. Because there is always something new to listen to. Pandora has become stale. If I Don't suggest a new artist the station keeps playing the same stuff over and over again. Sirius is worth the dough.",pandora

I recently upgraded to a Kindle Fire HDX, and can now play music while I'm reading or anything else I may be doing on the Kindle.

1/24/2017,I have been listening to Pandora for about 8 months and I will continue. Great music and it is such a bonus to be able to create my own stations. I wish it was easier to place a song request but that is the only negative I have. The positives far outweigh!,pandora
5/17/2016,I have been listening to Pandora for many years - I first saw it advertised when I was on the AARP internet page on the computer which belonged to my job - which I have retired from - it was advertised as Pandora Jukebox. I have it downloaded on my computer at home and my iPhone. I like that I get to choose the music I like to listen to - and I get to rate it. If I don't enjoy one of the songs that they are playing - I can stop it and go to the next one. I recommend Pandora to anyone who loves music as much as I do..,pandora

6/8/2013,"I have been using Pandora as a paid member, for years since before the 'app' came out. Now its everywhere, in my kindle, my iPhone, and even in a program form for my PC. Its my favortite App and Music Player. I have various moods for music, and by the entry of one song for the mood I'm in, it instinctivly plays other songs around that genre and style. Like sometimes I'm in the Lady Gaga mood, and then I listen to main stream dance pop for the evening. Other times I want to hear some Nickleback or Papa Roach, and then I am jamming to that and all simular songs. Another perk is it plays current new 'in' songs from that genre so I do get exposed to fresh music around my favorites selections, so its always expanding my musical horizons as well as keeping me saticfied with what ever mood I am in at the moment. I pay the anual fee for several years now, because.... who wants commercials? Why not pay them to help them operate their service, instead of letting advertizing agencies pay them and force their product in my face? I never hear commercials, which is one reason why I canceled my Satilight Radio service and switched to Pandora. ALSO it's MUCH cheaper annually than XM Radio, and can be heard on any internet device, unlike XM Radio, where only on registered devices. This is a great internet radio service :)",pandora

6/22/2016,I have been using Pandora for months to listen to music at work. I didn't care that there were advertisements since it was free. Now they are limiting the free music to 40 hours per month. I will find a new app for listening to music at work. I'm very disappointed.,pandora

4/7/2014,"I have been using Pandora for years now. I listen to it at work and home. One word of caution - even though it may say ""music for work"" be aware that it does not filter out all songs that have profanity. It may be considered mild but it depends on your setting. I would not use ""music for work"" if it was an educational setting even in an office. But that's just my opinion- I was so surprised to hear curse words on that station and quickly turned the volume down. Pandora offers plenty of options that everyone can find something that makes them happy to listen to.",pandora

You can create your on stations to your own personal music genre and like or dislike select songs that play randomly. The song that you have given thumbs up to starts to store on that particular station so it can play as often as you like. It's almost like creating your own CD, but, you can add more stations and add select artist to that one particular station of your choice. In my opinion this app is easy to use and plays awesome music!!!",pandora

 Fix permissions. Stop asking for location data. This is a radio program you dont need to know where I am. It wold be okay but even with locations off you keep pestering for it to be on. No means no. Pandora permissions keep getting more invasive. Creepy. If it isn't fixed will swap to new app.

Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows what you like it will play songs from that artist, or era, (80's rock).

8/25/2013,"I have Kindle, TV and Blue ray DVD player all connected on the same account and can listen to my playlist without making new ones.",pandora
11/26/2015,I have listen to this site for many years and love having it on my Kindle! having my stations with me simple priceless!,pandora
7/14/2012,I have listened to Pandora for several years and was very pleased to see it made available for the Kindle Fire.,pandora
2/7/2013,"I have listened to Pandora for the past few years and love it. Installing it on my Kindle Fire 2 and being able to listen to music in the background while using the Kindle for the web and other features is right up my alley. Also, I have been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sound. It's great for this device. Highly recommend.",pandora
10/16/2012,"I have listened to Pandora for years and enjoyed the music. Recently, however, it appears that the listener is being pushed away from free listening toward the premium pay listening.
 I receive about 80% of a song before Pandora switches to another song. Very annoying.
 I am switching to another alternative.",pandora
12/1/2012,I have listened to Pandora for years. Being able to pick and choose what I want to listen to is fantastic.,pandora
10/25/2015,"I have listened to Pandora music for over a year now, and I have enjoyed the freedom and variety of music offered through this app. It syncs well with my laptop and I know that it keeps a record of all my favorite ""thumbs up"" songs. I have appreciated the fact that the advertising on the app is not all intrusive, but is displayed in a small box in the center while the music plays on.
 My only negative, is that my music choice while enjoyable will tend to repeat itself more frequently after listening for a few days. The variety is limited and repetitive because it is free, but otherwise it is a pleasure to listen to Pandora. I believe it is worthwhile to invest in the paid version which offers more choices to those who can afford it.",pandora
5/30/2015,I have listened to Pandora radio for a long time and was pleased to get this app for my Kindle. It presents my choices is an easy to use format.,pandora
7/5/2014,I have little trouble getting it,pandora
2/7/2013,"I have loved Pandora for the last 5 years. This software/app seems to be doing great. I'm new to Amazon products & have previously used Apple products & the PC desktop icon for Pandora. I'm a Pandora One user(annual small fee, no commercials, better feed...) great re: creating own channels & auto customization based on what you like, don't like.",pandora
2/23/2015,"I have loved this app for several years; however, it doesn't seem to function very well on my Kindle. I've had it on two android devices, my iPhone, and now the Kindle. With the same network connection, it does not load the song promptly. Besides that, it's the exact same music loving quality one would expect from Pandora and it's seemingly endless stream of songs.",pandora
12/29/2013,"I have many music channels and even my own IPod. After a while, they seem to have repeats and I am easily bored. With all the music in this world, I don't want repeats. If one comes on Pandora, I just skip it, unless I have liked it and wont mind hearing it again.",pandora
10/23/2014,"I have mixed music taste, from classical to bluegrass, samba to classic rock, with show tunes and opera thrown in. Pandora puts a smile on my face and keeps it there all day, as I play music while I work. There is no substitute that I'm aware of -- Pandora is fantastic.",pandora
2/16/2014,I have never been disappointed with their choice of music.,pandora
5/5/2013,I have never been happier. My grandson set it up for me on my desk top computer about 5 or 6 years ago and have embraced ever since. One of the primary reasons why I like it so much is that I have some control over what I may want to listen to. Definitely 2 thumbs up.,pandora
12/31/2015,"I have never had an issue with this program on my HTC Thunderbolt (tho I do pay for the service and I also have unlimited data) and I use it all the time. I pay the monthy fee and have several channels set up. One can quickly get tired of managing and not getting weary of a personal list of mp3 files. Pandora frees me from having to deal with that.
 
 If you are using Green Power, you have to remember to pause Green Power or you will just get one song every 10 minutes.",pandora
5/6/2014,I have never had any issues with it! its awesome!,pandora
10/23/2011,I have never had any problems with Pandora. It does just what it promises.,pandora
11/26/2014,I have never used pandora before and downloaded the app because someone recommended it to me. Was suprised how I typed in an artist of genre and I got exactly what I wanted. I got current music that is hard to find on other websites and is not even heard on my local radio stations.,pandora
3/5/2016,"I have never used this before I got my Kindle and now I just wanna uninstall it. Not only did it not have the genres I listen to, it didn't have the artists I like. Not worth your time.",pandora
3/3/2013,"I have no clue how to use this app, wasn't aware I had it on here but I have been able to hear stuff on other peoples apps and it sounds good... which I could get some help with it on mine so I can enjoy it too.",pandora
4/26/2012,"I have no idea what others are complaining about. I have pro subscription so I don't get ads, but runs great on all my devices.",pandora
3/13/2012,"I have no idea why everyone doesn't use this. It's an amazing way to create your own radio station. Far fewer commercials that traditional radio. You also get mostly the artists you ask for, but they will also throw in new stuff you've never heard before. I also like hearing some older songs that aren't played on the radio very often anymore.",pandora
12/12/2011,"I have not been able to download it to my Kindle, can't give a review on somthing I have not used.",pandora
9/28/2012,I have not been disappointed in Pandora's ability to satisfy my musical needs for whatever mood I'm in. Love it.,pandora

10/1/2012,"I have not had this app ""force close"" on me ever on my Kindle Fire. It is nicely designed and gives easy access to all the same capabilities as the Pandora web site. If you want another mobile option for access to Pandora, I highly recommend getting this app.",pandora
3/25/2014,I have not had time to enjoy it yet. I am told that it is great.,pandora

 Could you let me know how to get it and where it would be found on my kindle? Thanks",pandora

10/1/2013,"I have not use it to much yet but when I have I have enjoyed the music. I'm able to bring up the music I want quickly and easily. I really like the quality of the sound of the music, a lot of the time my Kindle is too soft . I have to use earbuds or a plug in speaker to hear U Tube and some other music I've downloaded. Pandora plays nice and loud .enough through the Kindle. I do hate having to use a password to sign in, it's on MY Kindle which is open I don't see the need of a password.",pandora

6/11/2013,"I have only been using Pandora for a very few days, but so far I'm happy with it. It has a good selection of music and seeing as how it's free, you can't complain about any of it. If you don't like it, turn it off.",pandora
7/9/2015,"I have only been using the application for a few days, but so far I am impressed. The ability to create a ""radio station"" based on a particular artist is very intuitive, and the lyrics and notes are a interesting addition.",pandora

9/1/2014,I have only had a smart phone for about 8 months but Pandora is one of my favorite things about it. It is easy to work and select my type of music. I can put my blue tooth in and go for hours with Pandora playing. I recommend it to all my friends telling them it is the best.,pandora

12/5/2013,"I have Pandora everywhere my car my phone my laptop my tablet my TV. I pay for the subscription ,which takes away the ads I absolutely love Pandora. I started subscribing to Pandora when I had a birthday party coming up and I didn't want to go over thinking of what kind of songs I could play. I just put Pandora on and just kept on going with it all day I didn't have to worry about it. I did have to adjust the time it goes to sleep so that so I wouldn't have to be coming back every 20 minutes to click that I was still listening.",pandora
12/25/2014,I have Pandora in my phone and use it a lot. After many try's I am still not able to connect to it on my kindle. I would very much like to connect to it.,pandora
4/29/2014,"I have Pandora installed on my older model computer and had trouble with smooth streaming. With the Kindle Fire, the songs stream smoothly. If you're not familiar with Pandora, it is a program that allows you to choose the type of music you want to hear. I started with a favorite musician and put that name in my ""Station"". After that song ended, Pandora played a song from another artist of that genre. If I gave the song a thumbs up, the song continued and more of the new artist's songs would eventually be played on my ""station."" If I gave it a thumbs down, the song immediately stopped playing and Pandora went on to another artist and another song. I now have several ""stations"" -- one for relaxation music, one for blues, one for classical, one for country, etc. Pandora works great with Kindle Fire... Of course, the sound system isn't a Bose, so if your a musical purist, you shouldn't expect great surround sound.
 
 I really don't see how anyone can go wrong with downloading and using Pandora.",pandora
7/25/2013,I have Pandora it a great app.to have it's a five star rating with me. Hands Down!,pandora

10/2/2013,I have Pandora on everything I own which the app can be added to. I absolutely love it. You can create your own stations to listen to your favorite artists.

I used the thumbs up, thumbs down option and I plan to do more with Pandora when I have more time. I'm not sure if it's my Kindle or Pandora -- after the music has been playing for a while the screen goes black and I can't change anything any more.

12/14/2014,"I have subscribed to Pandora for years. It is great to have on our Amazon ""Alexa"". All I have to do is open the station I want, ""Alexa, Hillsong from Pandora"". Then as I listen to the songs I tell Alexa, I like this song or I don't like this song"". If it is saved as a ""like"" or a ""dislike"" I am building my own station.",pandora
1/1/2016,"I have subscribed to Pandora since they first offered package without ads - 2006 I believe - and listened for years before that. I have enthusiastically recommended the service to dozens and dozens of friends and even mere acquaintances; I figured I was doing them a good turn.
 NO MORE.
 Today's trigger was a Bait & Switch with the re-registration. The fee was listed a $3.99/month or $36/year, but only the one option in Google Play, a single button purchase at the monthly rate = $48 year. That's .33 more expensive than the listed annual rate.
 This is trickery and I take such details very seriously. It conveys to me that Pandora is now 1. a system that treats me disrespectfully and 2. it is run by those many now in business, who are consumed by avarice and greed.
 I know that businesses exist to make money and any service to consumers is only an epiphenomena, but this wasn't always the case with Pandora. It feels like a lose and makes me sad.
 But I could have live with this change. I did find great new music. There it is a far more sinister aspect Brave-New-Pandora: it is data mining all aspects of users' choice of music.

 Mr. Bieschke (Pandora's chief scientist) says ""We take all of these signals and lookay at correlations that lead us to come up with magical insights about somebody.""
 People's music, movie or bookay choices may reveal much more than commercial likes and dislikes. Certain product or cultural preferences can give glimpses into consumers' political beliefs, religious faith, sexual orientation or other intimate issues. That means many organizations now are not merely collecting details about where we go and what we buy, but are also making inferences about who we are.

 Out of $427.1 million in revenue in the 2013 fiscal year, advertising generated $375.2 million.

12/26/2013,"I have the paid version. the free version became pointless because of the commercials, just like spotify and terrestrial radio. the biggest flaw of pandora in the android/fire version is the lack of a way to filter out bands that you don't like...unless it's right in front of me and I didn't see it.",pandora

2/17/2013,"I have this on my phone and my kindle and Pandora is really useful. It sometimes limits the amount of songs you can skip, which is unfortunate since sometimes you have to listen to songs you don't like, and there are ads, but the app itself is really helpful.
 
 It's great to have one specific genre and for the music to stay on that track. I really enjoy the app.",pandora

8/20/2013,"I have to admit when I was first introduced to Pandora I was rather skeptical. However without a doubt it has become my go to app for music. To be able to build music lists from categories, names, styles, genres, or even song titles is just plain awesome. Even though you can't pick the songs that are played on your list you can help it evolve by giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings. I realize that since Pandora has come out there is newer and more sophisticated music apps coming out but so far I keep coming back to Pandora. Personally I subscribe to Pandora One which has been $36 per year and allows you to listen to music non-stop without commercial interruption. Highly recommended.",pandora

9/22/2013,"I have used Pandora since around 2006. It seemed at that time (in my experience)Pandora was one of the only services offering free streaming of music based on user input. I have Pandora One and I am disappointed that despite changing my settings to allow explicit content many of the songs are edited. It seems that the same songs are played several times over, even within a few hours. I still use Pandora Radio but I am losing enthusiasm fast. There are now many other similar services that offer a much greater selection of songs. I have tried several of the other services and the music has much more variety on many of the other services.
 
 _Bottom Line_ I would carefully compare all services before committing to one. There are now so many to choose from and each service has its limitations. Each service also has its perks too. Do some research and find out what fits best. Yes, I still recommend Pandora Radio to friends but I no longer recommend paying for the service. This review is based on my own opinion, individual experience, and style. I do not believe this is a one size fits all.",pandora
4/30/2014,"I have used the free version and paid version. I enjoyed both!! When you pick specific artists and create stations it does a good job at playing music in that same genre. I have used this app faithfully for years. The thumbs up and down option is great for customizing the station even more to your own personal liking. It keeps songs you really like replaying in the mix without over playing them. But, also adds new songs to the mix as well.",pandora

You can pick one or more genres of music you like and listen to it all day. Create several stations of what you like and it will continuously load music. You can dislike a selection and it will immediately go to another song. You can chose either one of your stations or intermix your stations. Share your stations with others also. What's not to like.,pandora

2/26/2014,I heard Pandora playing at someone's house several weeks ago. I decided to sign up for the free version to see what it was like. They do have ads however they are few and far between. There is no comparison to regular radio which bombard you with so many commercials it seems that there are more of them than there is music. With Pandora you can also choose your favorite genres. Most radio stations have a theme but Pandora is much better I think. I will never listen to radio again if Pandora is available.,pandora

11/27/2016,"I honestly just accessed the app store just to write this review. If I could have one downloaded app on my kindle, this would be it. Ever since downloading this, I've even been using it on my laptop.
 
 Pandora basically tells you to tell it what artists you love and plays their songs as well as other similar artists and songs. I've locked in Usher and it's been playing slow Chris Brown and J. Holiday and basically anything that sounds like Usher. It's super easy to use and you even have the choice to give thumbs down to songs you don't like (it'll skip it but you only have a limited amount per hour or so.)
 
 I recommend this for ANY music lover, you won't regret it & it's free.",pandora
11/9/2015,I honestly love Pandora but now it is telling me that I have five hours left of listening for free in March. They have never timed me and if it keeps on doing this then I will download I heart radio or some other free app. Please you guys are becoming cheap just because you decided to upgrade doesn't mean that a minor will pay you just cause you wanted to upgrade your stuff the other version was just dine to me. I love Pandora it is the app that I use absolutely everyday I don't want to have to delete it.,pandora

I got an email from Pandora wanting to know what I was doing with the app running on 3 devices. I guess they think i'am passing it around!!

2/24/2014,"I just recently signed up for Pandora and have not had the time to give you a fair, evaluation of what Pandora has to offer, at not monthly cost to me. Several of my friends have subscribed to other stations that offer what Pandora offers, but at monthly charge rates that can add up over the course of a years time.
 
 I have chosen several programs, on Pandora that meet my listening needs and have added peace and soothing my mind over sometimes stressful times and also offered me music of many music artists that I grew with when I was younger and are much more soothing than much of what I hear, on the general FM stations today.
 
 I lookay forward to listening more to Pandora in the future. Keep up the good broadcasting services you now are offering.
 
 The world today can be a hectic environment and peaceful music is more than appreciated by me and others that also carry many of the portable devices, like a Kindle Hd or I Pads.

5/24/2016,"I like a very wide range of music including country, Motown, jazz, Native American flute, show tunes, hip hop, and classical. I can only get that variety on Pandora. I have been tapping the thumbs up or thumbs down button to the songs pandora chooses for me ever since I downloaded it to my shiny new iPad 1 - was that 6 years ago? The result is I have the perfect radio station for my eclectic taste of music. No where else can I hear the smooth jazz fusion of Hiroshima followed by a sound track from the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. Pandora goes with me on all my devices and was a factor in me purchasing my Honda CRV - it came with Pandora built in! The commercials are annoying to me because the original Pandora was commercial free. Now they break in after every 6 or 7 songs. Still less frequent than regular radio but I might have to break down and pay the $4 a month to get rid of them. Best music app hands down.",pandora

5/25/2013,"I like Pandora. When I paid for a subscription I listened to my favorite styles of music on my android tablet, my Kindle Fire and my pc. When I switched to the free account, I could still listen on everything but my Kindle Fire. This app keeps telling me I've ""timed out"", even though I haven't listened to it for days. The last straw came when my KF notified me that Pandora had automatically been updated. I clicked on the app and was told I was timed out of a version I haven't even used! Some apps never stop running. This seems to be one of them. I thought it might help if I logged out instead of telling it to quit, but I couldn't get in to do that. If you want to pay for a subscription, you won't have this problem. But at least for now I'm through with this app that counts itself as running when it isn't being used.",pandora

 1.) It won't let me log back into Pandora without removing from my device and redownloading it.
 2.) Half the time it won't let me listen to music, it'll say that it can't find anymore related songs to change the station, but it does that on every station and hasn't gotten any better, it's done that to me very time this week I've tried to listen.
 3.) When the warning first popped up, it said I had 48 hours of free music left, so I logged out wanting to save it for long car rides, but when I logged back in a couple of days later it said I had no free music left, even though I hadn't listened to it at all.
 So Pandora, I'm willing to give you two stars for excellence in music, but I won't go any higher than that because of the glitches, I'd appreciate it very much if you would fix them, then maybe I can give you five stars.",pandora

3/29/2014,"I like this much more than I thought I would! I've tried others and they all have their own little niche, and hence, they are all a bit different but this one suits my needs perfectly. I don't want to listen to a whole album, I just want to listen to some of the tracks from my favorite artists and that's exactly what this provides. Of course it would be fantastic to have the best of all of these types of apps together in one app but that would cost a fortune.
 I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of data that this doesn't use.....of course it could be much better, but compared to others, this uses a lower amount of data. There are a ton of visual advertisements!!! But, I use this on my phone and I minimize it so that I don't see them. I don't know if that helps keep the amount of data usage lower but like I said, compared to other music streaming apps this is far superior.",pandora

  The selection and variety of music though is really nice and I suppose I could pay and have those annoying ads removed, but the ads themselves really dont bother me. Just how loud they are. I read one time that increased volume on ads supposedly increases their effectiveness which is why television ads are required to fall within a certain volume level.
 
 Perhaps it is more jarringly noticeable because I am playing soft lullabies. That is my only complaint though and use this free app a lot without it freezing or having bugs.",pandora

6/24/2016,I love how it plays great songs after songs but one thing I don't like is you only have a limited amount of songs you can dislike until it plays it and gives you the notice you have disliked to many songs. Our where it plays two commercials when you skip a song.,pandora

Before I got the pandora app I was thinking, 'Is it one of those radios where you have stations like 98.7 and 95.5. Is it a kind of radio where you can't pick your songs, author or genre?

You just have to create a station and hope for the song you want to hear. Another great feature is that you can listen to stuff other than music too. I have a comedy station that brings up comedian routines, not songs.",pandora
12/7/2013,I love Pandora! I could never live with out it. The songs on the stations are awesome!! my favorite stations are today's hits and today's country <3,pandora

7/18/2013,"I love Pandora! I listen at home, in my car, at work, and everywhere in between. After a few months of teaching Pandora my likes versus dislikes, she truly has learned my tastes. When I change from my personal stations, I know exactly what I am going to get. I even enjoy mixing things up a bit when I dabble with the premade channels Pandora makes available. They are very good but my personal preference are the stations I create by choosing my favorite songs and genres. Great job Pandora.",pandora

12/12/2013,I Love Pandora! Its A Great App For People That Love Music....The Only Thing I Dislike About Pandora Is That You Can Only Change The Song On A Track Six Times... But Other Than That Its Great! I Would Rate It Four Stars Instead Of Five Just Because Of The Issue With Skipping The Track Only Six Times.,pandora
12/7/2013,"I love Pandora! I've set up over a dozen personalized ""stations"". I can hear whatever music I am in the mood for, from classical to Supertramp, to Sade, to Fun., and whatever similar artists and songs that Pandora pulls.

 My preference is SMOOTH JAZZ it gives peace of mind and I can meditate, relax, after work or cleaning house on a Saturday morning.

12/11/2013,"I love Pandora, and this app is no exception. It is great to be able to just log in and have a personalized radio. It also exposes you to different music that you would have never thought of listening to. However, that's only when it works. Unfortunately, this app very rarely functions properly on my Kindle Fire HD. It often freezes up, and refuses to do anything except close, and it is also prone to just completely not opening. It is ridiculously annoying. But still, it is a great app, when it works.",pandora
7/8/2016,"I love Pandora, and use it everywhere. I can select the artists, music, comedy, etc. And choose not to listen to a track again, or more often. I wish I could forward more often, though.

12/10/2012,"I love Pandora. It works very well on my Motorola DROID phone. It works somewhat less well in my Volvo car in that there is a long delay before the first track plays and a rather lengthy delay between each subsequent track. Also, often, Pandora in the Volvo will repeat tracks which is very annoying. But, I love being able to access my favorite styles of music for free and stream them for hours on end. I also like how I am able to listen to different takes by artists than those that are generally played on the radio. And, there are a number of live tracks that are played.

4/13/2013,I love Pandora.. The fact that I can choose what I want to listen to and subscribe for commercial free music for such a cheap price is awesome... Satellite radio is expensive and you don't get to choose anything,pandora
2/13/2014,"I love Pandora... but recently, it's not as great. When I start it up, it takes 3-5 tries to get a song to play. After a few songs it stops playing. It's disappointing to know such a great app can have so many glitches.
 
 It's not like I don't like Pandora, because I really do. I like how it's free but of course, free is limited... but to be honest, you can do lots of things users that pay them can. For once. It's great to know that I can listen to certain music instead of a mix.
 
 Overall I love it! :)",pandora

1/1/2014,I love panora. Always plays music I wanna hear. Just wish It wouldn't lose signal so much. But overall I love it,pandora
8/20/2013,"I love rock music like Led Zeppelin. I tried to type in Led Zeppelin and my favorite song, Stairway to Heaven, but it shows a lot other music that you don't want to listen to.
  You can type in The Beatles then Jimmy Hendrix could show up. You only get three skips to skip a song you don't like. Total rip off. You can't listen to the music you typed in; only random music of that genre.
  Also, it doesn't even let you make a playlist of your favorite music. You will be lucky if you get a few songs by that artist or the one song you typed in. Sometimes even if you don't get the song you want, you can listen to others that you might like.
   Another flaw is that you can't listen to the same song again after you listen to it once. You cannot replay nor can you rewind or fast forwarded songs.
 Waste of time for those of you who want to listen to certain music.
 I give this 5/10.",pandora

6/28/2013,"I love that amazon has apps to download. The apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost",pandora

8/22/2013,"I love that I can find the stations I am in the mood for. It's easy to use. The reason for only 3 stars is that I have it installed on my phone, and sometimes it kicks on by itself. It doesn't matter if I'm at work, or school or in the middle of the night. I won't be using my phone and all of a sudden I start hearing music. Since I always have my volume up so I can hear my phone, when Pandora comes on, it is loud! If that were fixed so it wouldn't randomly start playing, I would give it 5 stars.",pandora

You are allowed so many song skips per hour of listening. I love that there are multiple stations that i can choose from.

2/24/2014,"I loved Pandora. I use to listen to it when I went to bed. Well one day, I got a message saying that I had exceeded my limit of 40 hours that month. It said if I would just pay $.99 I could listen for the rest of the month for free. Since I loved it so much I tookay the offer. I then proceeded to leave the app after it said I had successfully purchased my rest of the month. When I came back later that day, it gave me the same message. I figure it just didn't register the first time so I went and checked my acount. When I lookayed Pandora did take the $.99 from me but didn't register it. Being annoyed I just paid again. Then I was listening to my music and it kept skipping songs. My mother told me to uninstall it and then reinstall it. So I uninstalled it. When I went to reinstall, it kept failing. So that means I lost $2 to Pandora. I know it's not much, but when I only get a gift card of $25 for my kindle on gift giving holidays, it makes me a bit frustrated. I want my money back! How do I ask for it back?",pandora

2/7/2012,"I mean, it's Pandora Radio...on your Kindle. What else do I need to say? It works just like the mobile app. okay the one thing that comes to mind is that to close the app, you have to pretty much go to your Home Page and then hit the more options button on the top right corner and tap ""Quit"". If you tap the Home button, it continues to play in the background. No big deal, and its a little weird to me probably because I've only had the Kindle for a little over a month.",pandora

When I pay I would hope they at least stream at 320 kbps. Really, they should stream lossless as an option in the settings. It's like paying for satellite radio. Why would I when the quality is set so low? Everyone has just gotten away from really listening to albums because there way too much loss at these qualities. Pandora, please upgrade to a higher streaming kbps. Otherwise, I'll never pay for it. You are now asking us to pay for 192, when you used to offer it free. What's the incentive then? None.",pandora

For instance I really, really wanted to hear ""Over the Rainbow"" by the wonderful Hawaiian singer so I clicked on the song and added it to my ""radio.""

4/27/2014,"i personaly have pro and cons of this app but I overall I like it and use it frequency.
 I like many things: ""liking"" a song, sharing via social network and creating custom stations.

10/8/2013,"I play this all the time. Only downfall is after a while, songs will creep in that aren't even close to the genre selected. I made a Motley Crue station (gotta love the 80s hair metal), and after a couple hours, Bryan Adams played. WTF. ",pandora
11/29/2012,"I prefer ""Google play music"" it has way less commercials,but this is a change of pace. I like how they keep track of the thumbs up songs and make a custom station.I pay for Amazon prime music and use it most often",pandora

8/1/2017,I primarily listen to Christian music. It plays all the songs I hear on my satellite radio in my car.,pandora

12/12/2013,"i purchase4d my kindle fire, I live in Ecuador but when I purchased, no indications that some of the apps don't work in my country.
 Pandora does'nt as well as games like Sudokayu.
 I think that I should have been advised that some of the applications don't work ourtside US. One of the reasons I purchased Kindle Fire was for the games!!

7/14/2012,I purchased the Pandora One subscription. There are several things I enjoy about Pandora. I have been able to check my favorites list when I wanted to check out a song I've heard for the first time I liked. Being able to give a song a thumbs up or down helps control which songs I want on rotation too. You can use the free Pandora with all the same features too. The only difference is the free version contains ads.,pandora
10/2/2013,I purchased the subscription a few years ago and it's worth it. Sat radio is not for me as i enjoy building my own stations on Pandora.,pandora

1/22/2013,I really do not know why I have to write a review about this. Its a great app excluding the advertisements.,pandora
2/10/2014,"I really don't get this app. While trying to listen to music, different songs would start playing and I couldn't shut it off.

10/7/2013,I really enjoy listening to many stations on this app. My only comp!ain't is hearing some of the sleazy advertisements that are riske and rude.,pandora
6/26/2014,"I really enjoy listening to music and I like the idea that you could chose the artist you want to listen to. However, if I type a specific artist I hate the fact that you listen to one of their songs and then a different artist comes on. They don't play the songs from the artist you choose consistently. They'll play one song but then go to a different artist and then back to your artist....I don't really care for that style. If I put in Prince, I only want to listen to his music....",pandora

This problem only happens on my Kindle Fire HD 8, which I have to Shut Down when I leave because Pandora may come on and use up all the battery. I do not sign out to end the music, only ""Quit"" because it's very difficult to sign in. I don't know if this is a Pandora problem or a Kindle problem.
 Update 4-16-17: After the recent Pandora update, this problem has finally been fixed! Much improvement with this last update, too.",pandora

12/4/2012,I really enjoy using Pandora! There are so many options as to music styles and it is so easy to use. I haven't begun to test the limits of what it can do. And I like the fact that it can play in the background without interfering with other work I am doing.,pandora
12/6/2015,"I really enjoy using pandora. The only problem I have is that the commercials are interfering with the app. Before the song is done playing a commercial comes on and ruins the whole song. I understand the reasons for commercials, but how about after the songs over?",pandora

7/18/2016,I really like having the Pandora app on my phone. I can listen to different stations without having to have a traditional home or car radio. I like that I can take it anywhere with me. I also like that I can go in and out of stations to find a song that I like or want to hear. If I don't like the current song I can just back out and then go to another station.,pandora
3/16/2013,"I really like his service. I have three differnt statons programmed. You have to fool with it a bit to get the individual statons playing your requested format, but they give Artist info and usually a list of ""like"" artists which you can add as ""seeds"".
 After a while, your ""station"" will be playing, pretty much, the genre you desire, along with a bunch of additions you forgot, didn't think of, or never heard of.
 Be patient!
 It'll come around.
 You can ""Thumbs down"" selections you don't want.

10/7/2015,"I really like Pandora and I listen to it daily when I am at work. I can have every genre of music that I enjoy and it is very relaxing and helps me stay focused.

1/31/2017,I really like Pandora and like having it available on a smaller device than a computer.,pandora
11/17/2014,"I really like Pandora as you can find a station based on your artist. If you give the thumbs up for songs, they tend to play them and others like it more often.

2/5/2016,"I really like Pandora, but not sure if its Pandora or my Kindle, but the song will start to play then stop and then start again. There is a pause in the middle of the song, it reminds me of my CD's skipping.",pandora
1/25/2017,"I really like Pandora, but the only complaint I have is that when you create a station, after a while the songs start to get repetitive and it is hard to keep the station fresh. You basically have to add an artist to the station to get some fresh songs in there, but even then it gets a little stale after a while. However, it's free and it works. The stream does not get interrupted unless you have a really weak signal. It's a great way to hear some new music or artists you were otherwise not familiar with.",pandora
2/20/2014,"I really like Pandora. But for some reason, and only recently, I can't exit the app on my Kindle Fire. The button for the option to quit will not respond.

8/23/2013,I really like the Pandora app. I've accessed in on my personal computer at home for several years and am really excited to be able to use it on my Kindle Fire. It's great to use in my RV!,pandora
4/22/2014,I really like the Pandora player. The channels are very good at finding similar bands to the one you are searching for and plays a nice selection of music. My only real complaint is the very limited number of skips that you get for the day even if you subscribe.,pandora
12/12/2012,"I really like the variety of music. I have mine on shuffle so I will have a 60's song, then a country, then rock and roll! It is great, except of course the commercials, but there are like gobs of them!",pandora
1/20/2014,I really like the variety offered by Pandora but I am having difficulty customizing it to my wants. Maybe I should read the directions again!,pandora
9/28/2016,I really like this a lot because it h a d a lot of music so that's the only reason,pandora
5/29/2013,I really like this app because it got all kind of music. This is a good app for anyone that likes music.,pandora

9/12/2013,"I really like this app, and it is nice because if the device turns off, you can still listen to the music. You can make a new radio by entering the artist or song and the radio will play songs similar to the one that you typed in and made a station. Hope the review was helpful and lookay for my other review for covet fashion! Peace Out!",pandora
1/14/2014,"I really like this app. I was able to cancel my Sirius subscription and save money. I use it on my smartphone in my car and in my home. At home, I connect to a bluetooth speaker. When a call comes in, the music is silenced until I finish the call and then it automatically starts playing music again. Unlimited music selection.",pandora
5/28/2014,"I really like this app. it knows just what to play. I love listening to the praise and worship station while falling asleep, its very soothing. overall a great app in my opinion, if you dont like it then sorry, download something else",pandora
12/19/2012,"I really like this Pandora app because I may choose the type of music. I then can choose a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" in order to refine the choices that Pandora gives me. I simply put it on and it plays the music I like so I may relax during my breaks at work. This is great!",pandora
6/12/2012,I really like this. It came with the Challel Master DVR and that got me connected. I tried it on my computer where I pick the songs. Now I added it to my Fire and that gives me some mobility. Bobbj,pandora
11/5/2013,I really like this. You can find the music you want easier. It comes it get. I don't have to worry about it fading out.,pandora
12/26/2014,"I really like using Pandora, especially when I don't know exactly what I want to listen to. I'm able to play the songs and styles I like, discard what I don't like or am not in the mood for. Pandora then plays songs and styles that I like, and the choice to skip or listen.",pandora
12/4/2012,I really like using Pandora. I can listen to all the kinds of music I like without commercials. It's really good for use at work.,pandora

6/25/2016,I really love love love Pandora! There is only one thing........ you can only have six skips per hour on each station and that is my only complaint the rest is amazing.,pandora
2/10/2017,"I really love this app and use it all the time! I've gotten into so much new music, it isn't even funny.",pandora
1/1/2013,I really love to listen to music of my choice. All you do is choose your artist and it plays music by that artist and others that play similiar music. Love it!,pandora
10/27/2013,I really loved Pandorea until today when I opened it and it was a totally different format. This format allows annoying ads to be on top of the song information where before ads were in the corner. My grandmas old phone had this format about ten years ago! I do not like the format and think it is harder to use. Please change it back!,pandora
5/19/2013,"I really miss Songza so was on the hunt for a new app to play music. Found Pandora, tried it, and love it.",pandora
11/11/2017,I really really enjoy,pandora
7/28/2016,"I really thing it is awsome, to be able to listen just to the music I like. I can take my kindle to any room i go to and listen to what ever music i like. I even have certain songs i like to listen to for sleeping. Thanks",pandora
5/16/2017,I really think that this app is one of the best music apps I have downloaded yet. Thank you Pandora u rock,pandora
2/9/2014,"I really used to love this app but recent updates have made my kindle fire unstable and the ads have been regularly crashing the app. Also, the ads have become more frequent. I could probably deal with if they worked properly and music would resume after they finished. Until this is fixed, I cannot recommend this app.",pandora
12/21/2014,I really wanted pandora because it's great on the computer but when I went to log in it wouldn't let me I've tried everything I could. Bye pandora,pandora
12/4/2012,i really wished this app had a history button. had a song stuck in my head for weeks i cant remember the lyircs but i know of it. good though. request. history button please.,pandora

10/25/2015,I reccomend this app for anyone! It has a hugr variety of music and is free! You can create as many different stations as you want and there are way less commercials then the radio! I love this app and use it all the time!,pandora
8/10/2015,"I received head phones for Mother's Day along with a suggestion for Pandora. I now live with phones on my head almost all day long. We have become so accustomed to TV, the computer and today's technology ""stuff"" .. I had almost forgotten the shear joy of LISTENING to music and actually HEARING the WORDS of the songs. With Pandora I can choose what I want to listen to ..
 it's truly wonderful.",pandora
4/19/2012,I received two new charms for Christmas and loved both of them ! I have loved everything I have ever received or bought myself from Pandora ! I just love it !!,pandora
5/10/2014,I recently added a SirisuXM app so doubt I will be using this app very much. No fault of Pandora.,pandora
2/29/2016,"I recently downloaded this app thought it was awesome at first and then it said I had to start paying because I went over the amount of hours. So I was pretty upset about that cause I really like Pandora but I guess I can still use it on a regular computer. Honestly I think a great app for a kindle fire or any tablet would be Iheartradio because its free,you never have to pay and it's somewhat similar to what Pandora gives you and also you can listen to your favorite radio stations. But overall Pandora is an awesome app it just sucks it's not always going to be free.",pandora
5/19/2014,"I recomend this app for and to everyone.You keep your track right on this and it doesn't take much space up at all! it has old songs, new songs, and much much more !please get this app.... you'll enjoy it",pandora
5/24/2013,I recommed this to all. It has lots of kinds of music for adults as well as children. It fits my moods!,pandora
12/22/2015,I recommend it. It's like your own personal radio station. I enjoy it everyday. You get to listen to old and new favorites.,pandora
1/4/2014,I recommend Pandora Media. It is excellent way to listen to the music you want This is a good product.,pandora
3/2/2014,I recommend Pandora strongly and listen to it exclusively instead of radio. It is worth paying for a subscription to get rid of those pesky commercials.,pandora
12/27/2012,I recommend you get this app for all your music needs. works perfectly no problems what so ever. has all of my favorite songs.even the ones I don't here on the raido any more. is also great for kids. get this app.,pandora
5/17/2014,I recommend you to get Pandora. you can type in Pop music and it will give you some stations. you can even skip songs! but the downside is ads but everything has ads I guess,pandora
12/1/2013,I refuse to sign up for a plus membership.,pandora
1/29/2013,I registered this app but every time I try to sign in the app swirls and the screen goes blank. I haven't been able to listen to any music.,pandora
6/11/2017,"I remember listening to Pandora and hearing an ad every 3 or 4 songs, now it seems as tho it's 2 songs, then an ad. If I JUST had an ad, skip a song, it has an ad again. Annoying, but, it's free. As for the songs, I'm a fan of Industrial music and it seems as tho Pandora only plays songs by 6 or 7 different bands. I KNOW there are more Industrial bands out there! It serves it's purpose, it keeps my niece dancing on bad days, but the amount of ads is getting insane. It isn't driving me to upgrade, it's driving me to find another service.",pandora
3/4/2013,"I remember when Pandora first came out and how impressed by it I was. I got busy for awhile and didn't have a great phone to download it on for a few years and it sort of slipped my mind. Now that I've downloaded it to my tablet and galaxy s5, I am constantly listening to my stations. The Music Genome Project and it's results never cease to impress and amaze me. I am able to steer a station in the right direction and then Pandora turns it into an ideal station suited to my likes. Great app!",pandora
2/19/2013,"I saw that a sleep timer had been added, but with the new update it is gone again. What happened? The only reason I put this app on my kindle was so I could fall asleep to relaxing music.",pandora
4/22/2014,i searched for 1 song but the station only played it once,pandora
11/13/2013,I seem to get a better mix of music on my phone than I do on my computer. Have to watch out for usage when off the network.,pandora
2/20/2015,"I selected ""Pokayey LaFarge"" and that was the artist first played. But since then I get only music similar in style. Also, had to go to ""contact"" to get password fix and it tookay two tries.",pandora
4/19/2014,"I selected the app ,it said it downloaded but when I select it to open and let me start selecting music it doesn't work. All I get is the Pandora blue screen..",pandora

9/5/2014,"I should have known, Pandora is not available in asia. The app probably works great.....elsewhere..... or with a U.S.VPN. Sorry to disapoint you my fellow expats.",pandora
8/17/2017,"I simply cannot believe Pandora expects people to PAY for service!
 1. The lyrics to songs are either wrong or non-existent. I've come across so many lyrics that have nothing to do with the current song playing!
 2. If I were the artist, as to the Biography that was written about me, I would definitely contact someone at Pandora as they appear to be total idiots! How can anyone unintentionally, put in a biography about an artist, that isn't about that artist? O.o That fact is beyond "" Sloppy"" it's entirely Unprofessional!!!!
 3. When creating a new station for the genre I enjoy, I am constantly given tracks that are not even in the same realm... ??? O.o So I sit and one after another, Thumbs down to the track.. How do they come up with this?
 
 Mr.Westergren's statement as to Pandora competing with iTunes is ludicrous as it appears that Pandora is put together by a group of prepubescent children experimenting with a music program.",pandora
1/23/2014,I simply just didnt like the app. The interface is confusing. Music discovery is difficult. This app simply sucks. There has got to be better music apps out there. I'd skip this one.,pandora
5/11/2016,I simply love it!,pandora
1/9/2014,I simply love this app ant nothing better. I love music and comedy this app provides both. the only thing that sucks is that the schools wont let you us it there,pandora
12/28/2014,I sincerely appreciate the quick response and remedy to my problem.....Amazon recommended to contact the Pandora support team and provided the address...I was plesantly surprised to get such a quick response.,pandora
3/20/2013,I so enjoy using Pandora...especially as it gives me access to wonderful Hawaiian music! I can't say enough good things about this app!,pandora
7/8/2013,"I spend the less than 10 bucks for no ads, worth it.",pandora
1/9/2013,I spent alot of time tryingto find a good radio/music app and before Pandora all the others were horrible. Pandora works very well and is in my opinion the best music app out there,pandora
6/29/2016,"I start my day listening to Pandora while I exercise, at the end of the day it puts me to sleep.",pandora
6/20/2012,"I started getting political (and other) advertisements that interrupted both my music and any games I was playing. I have not positively isolated the source of these ads. When I do that application will be deleted permanently and I may reload Pandora. I could not skip, stop, or delete these ads except by Shutting Down my Kindle. I am filing a complaint with AMAZON and KINDLE SUPPORT.
 
  I have really liked listening to music on PANDORA that was from my school years. That is why I gave it two stars. However, I will NOT have any application that includes advertising that is this intrusive on my Kindle.",pandora
9/8/2015,"I started listening to Pandora years ago and despite other competitors appearance on the market (slacker, iheart etc) I still use Pandora.",pandora
11/2/2013,"I started listening to Pandora years ago and they would not only play the songs by the artists I picked, they would point me to artists I had never even heard of which led me to buy their music and thus expand my music collection. I will keep on listening and hopefully hear about even more artists whose music needs to be heard.",pandora
4/25/2014,"I started out with them but graduated to Vevo, love it much better. I deleted it for Vevo. sorry couldn't help myself.",pandora

12/10/2015,"i started using this app some time ago told my wife about it she loves it, she use it when she walks.",pandora
2/24/2017,I still get to listen to ADS!!! How do I get rid of them---while I'm PAYING FOR THIS SERVICE?,pandora
1/21/2013,I still havent figured it all out but will continue to us. May be a prob with my device. Kindle fire,pandora
8/14/2017,"I still love pandora!
 I have prime, and google play. but I still use pandora about... 1/3 of the time. it's nice to have it totally on autopilot!",pandora
9/12/2013,I still use it.,pandora
2/17/2016,I subscribe to Pandora and I've never had issues with the program on my laptop or phone. Since I upgraded to the Kindle Fire HD the app will not allow me sign off. This is annoying.,pandora
6/12/2016,"I subscribe to Pandora radio...but I subscribed through GooglePlay 6 months ago.I downloaded the app onto my new Kindle..logged in...and no music.It shows the album art and everything like normal....but not a sound. Maybe because I originally got it through Google??
  This is not cool.I'm starting to see this Kindle as a waste of $$ and just as an electronic sales pitch from Amazon.
  My Pandora works fine on everything else except this Kindle.So 5 stars for Pandora...1 star for whatever reason it won't play on this thing.",pandora
11/13/2012,"I subscribe to several internet music programs and this is one of the best. The free version is O.K. but if you listen to music alot, I recommend the paid version.",pandora
10/3/2015,"I subscribed to Pandora to get rid of the ads and allow it to stay on longer. I was hoping it would let you program in some of your own favorite elements - I knew it wouldn't take a play list, which is fine - but it works about the same as the free station as far as what songs come up. Since I work at my computer, I am right there to like or dislike selections, so with diligence I can get a station to play a very specific sound. I believe with my subscription I also get to click on the likes/dislikes more times per hour. I would recommend the subscription to anyone who uses Pandora a lot and can take the time to ""design"" a station.",pandora
7/30/2014,I suppose that it's okay if you want to be forced to listen to music that you are not interested in. I deleted the app.,pandora
12/27/2013,"I suppose this app is okayay if one listens to only English music. I listen exclusively to Italian & French music. It is next to impossible to find the artists I love. Antonio Maggie, Emmanuel Moire, Tiziano Ferro, Sinsemilia, Paolo Meneguzzi, Povia. The app assumes I do not mean what I type in the search bar. It is useless to me. I emailed Pandora support, I heard nothing back. I will find another app that doesn't presume & actually reads my search criteria.",pandora
7/24/2014,I switched to Pandora after Slacker failed me on the Kindle Fire. Loving it at the moment. It does have the occasional glitch/spazz out but nothing serious. I think this is about as good as it gets for free Internet Radio.,pandora
11/30/2014,I take my music wherever I want.,pandora
1/16/2013,I take pandora everywhere with me. I listen to it at work & home. This is my favorite music app.,pandora
1/23/2016,I teach piano and the students can hear the music played by the Masters.,pandora
12/2/2014,"I tell it to not play an artist on a channel, and three songs later that same artist shows up. It is redundant. I would rather use Spotify and know that it will only play the music I want to listen to.",pandora
10/7/2015,I think anyone who's tried Pandora considers it a keeper...and now I've got it on my Kindle Fire HD. A big thumb's up.,pandora
9/11/2016,"I think every body should use Pandora because, it allows you to listen to music when ever you want to.",pandora
9/22/2013,I think I Heart radio is much better it may have comerciqls but they play great songs and it doesn't fail,pandora
12/28/2013,I think I like it. They have changed their format and I am still figuring it out.,pandora
1/19/2012,I think I would love this app if I could get it to connect. I sign in and wait and wait and wait...,pandora
6/28/2015,i think it is a cool pro g ram . i prefer to mix up genres a bit and have to listen one genre at a time,pandora
2/23/2013,I think it is cool and it helps people go to sleepand it cool for people at Eng age and for tron people for partys,pandora
1/17/2013,I think it is difficult to run. Sometimes it works and sometimes no matter what I do it won't play.,pandora
2/12/2017,"I think it is grate I am 80 and it is great to listen to what I did in the 50's,it is really grate",pandora
1/28/2014,I think it is great. Music plays randomly.you can choose your type of music or artist it great when riding in the bus or train. You csn not really choose the songs.,pandora
8/12/2017,I think it is great. Sorry I did not listen to friends that had recommended sooner.,pandora
2/18/2014,I think it is so awesome. They have great song selections. I like how you can like a song and then it will play it more evert so often.,pandora
7/15/2016,I think it is so much fun to see what happens when I choose my favorite songs. But I wish I could skip every song I d like. Instead I have to switch stations t change music.,pandora
10/6/2012,I think it is wonderful to be able to access so many different types of music and even get a little background on the groups and see lyrics. The only thing that's needed to make this 5 stars would be more relevant music choices when you choose an artist. As an example I chose Beach Boys and the subsequent music will be a different style from the 50's.,pandora
3/16/2014,I think it was a good bookay to read and find out how he should and not his brother because it was he fought......,pandora
6/10/2014,I think its a cool app at night I like or just anytime you want to just chill out and do you. ( GET THE APP RIGHT NOW) Change that from like to love.OOOOOOOOO YES,pandora
1/12/2012,I think it's a good way to discover music you may not have heard already. You're not able to choose a song but at least you can choose from artist and/or the types of music you enjoy.,pandora
3/18/2013,I think it's a great app. It's all you would want but I personally would like more thumb downs available . But if you are lookaying for an app to personalize your own stations and optional privacy it's great. Check it's so good I'm listening to it while I'm typing!!!!,pandora
9/25/2015,I think it's a great program. Sometimes I have to babysit it a bit in order to keep it on track.,pandora
7/14/2014,I think it's amazing,pandora
1/16/2014,I think it's better than I heart radio .,pandora
3/12/2016,I think its great and I would recommend pandora to eveyone that loves music. I listen to it as much as I can.,pandora
9/5/2014,I think its nice....so much competition. I heart radio and others. It has genres others dont have. But why the commercials...got to upgrade.,pandora
12/29/2013,I think it's really covienient and you get a good song most of the time. Unlike the radio when it's the same songs over and over based on the genre of the radio station.,pandora
5/14/2013,"I think my own complaint with this app is that is loads so slowly or not at all. I don't know if thats pandora's fault with all its ads or just my connections, although I don't seem to have the same problem with my other radio app or game apps for the most part. Otherwise, I love the music pandora plays.",pandora
1/8/2012,I think once I get to play with it more and figure a few more things out it will be great!Little slow in the technical aspects of life.,pandora
12/20/2012,I think Pandora has a better music quality than iheart radio but I have problems switching stations. I often have more then one song playing at one time so I have to uninstall the app to get it to stop playing which is really annoying during school.,pandora
2/5/2014,I think Pandora is a good app and I think everone should get Pandora you will be so happy any proud that you got Pandora at your side and you will be so happy with Pandora get Pandora.,pandora
12/12/2012,I think Pandora is a good app to listen to music with but sometimes the app acts all stupid and wont play your stations but not always.,pandora
5/25/2013,I think Pandora is a great app because wen u want to listen to good music its there. I say u should get this app.,pandora
2/7/2014,I think Pandora is a great app to download on anything because you can listen to the music you like for free and. the timer for when you wake up is your favorite song.,pandora
3/31/2012,"I think Pandora is a great app! Pandora has all the music you would want but, there is no playlists or personal music. In spotify you can create radio channels, you get recommended music, you can go to different genres of music and find specific music that you would enjoy. You can also save music to your own playlists and listen to it anywhere for free with no internet!",pandora
10/1/2015,I think Pandora is a great radio station where you can program your favorite music and artists and be delighted listening to your music for hours. Thank you Pandora and keep the good work!,pandora

6/25/2014,I think pandora is awesome!!!,pandora
2/18/2014,I think Pandora is by far the best music app. I can listen to all of my favorite bands free. It also plays music like it on the station.,pandora

6/30/2013,"I think Pandora is not that fun to listen to, but me, yes I like Pandora , Pandora makes me play my Drums.",pandora
1/2/2015,I think Pandora is the best app for music for your device. The only tho g I have against it is the wifi issue.,pandora
10/9/2017,I think Pandora is the ultimate way to hear all the music I want to hear without all the music I don't want to hear.,pandora
1/5/2014,I think that 3 stars may even be a little generous.,pandora
11/10/2015,I think that Pandora is a great app and would recommend it to anybody but the one thing that pisses me off is how after you skip a couple songs they wont let you skip anymore,pandora
10/7/2015,"I think that Pandora is a great app to have, especially because its free, but also because it allows you to listen to relativley any sort of music. It is a very pleasurable thing to have on your phone, and I very much enjoy it. A few downsides would be that unless you upgrade it, you have constant commercials and advertizments which sometimes block your ability to view the album cover and/ or the song lyrics. Also, you often get a mix of artists on your station, even if you specify a particular artist. So, you may have, for example, a Lady Gaga station but instead of Lady Gaga it constantley plays Ke$ha and Rhiana and Miley Cyrus, which is perfectley fine. It just may take a while to find a Lady Gaga song and it doesnt allow you to press skip very often because you have a dailey skip limit, which virtually most radio apps have, anyway. I enjoy it none the less, and I hope that you will, too!:)",pandora
2/3/2014,I think that Pandora is great. Choose an artist and similar artists are included. Nice variety of music. I recommend it to anyone who has a tablet or IPhone.,pandora
7/26/2014,I think that Pandora is one of the best apps for music because of all the choices and all the easy searches. you get to chose whatever you want and it can be any of the genres you enjoy listening to its a great app.,pandora
12/31/2013,"I think that Pandora is totally the best!!! Really hands down I can take anywhere and enjoy the music I enjoy, not what someone else has programmed! Best ever ,I am totally sold on Pandora :)",pandora
9/2/2012,I think that they tried to make a good app but it is not working on my Kindle... every time I start the app It takes forever to start.,pandora
6/2/2014,"I think that this app is probably the best music app you can get. Free music, but you dont get to choose what song you listen to. But it will give you the songs that are related to it. It also gives you the best quality you can get. Awesome and highly recommended by me.",pandora
1/3/2014,I think that this app is the best and I love mucic!!!!,pandora
12/30/2013,"I think the app is great. My only complaint about Pandora is that you can't pick specific song's or artists that you want to hear, they just match you up to song's similar to the song and artist of your choosing, which can be frustrating but it's better than the radio for background music and I knew what I was getting so I still gave a 5 star rating.",pandora
11/7/2014,"I think the concept of Pandora is great, but I would like to have information about maneuvering through and being able to make it work for me. Where do you find instructions?",pandora
6/27/2014,I think the free music is great but the load in when you enter it is long. Best thing to do is delete the app than download it again.,pandora
1/4/2014,I think the music is wonderful and very few commercials. You get the kind of music that you like not all this jas they are playing today.,pandora
10/5/2013,"I think the sound quality and volume varies a lot from song to song. Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in my car for a while. I thought it was great! But for the $15 / mo. that they wanted for a subscription, they didn't have enough stations I wanted to make it worth while. I play cd's a lot because of sound quality and level.

 any of their choices.",pandora
5/10/2016,I think this app is amazing you can listen to your songs favorite songs withough having to buy them but you cant go back a song or resins to a part you miss and you have to hope you get a song you like that's really the only down sides though,pandora

1/6/2014,I think this is a really good app to listen to music I love it for falling a sleep to on those nights where you can't fall a sleep.,pandora
10/1/2015,"I think this is absolutely the BEST music app I've ever had! It's better than I Heart Radio by a landslide! Any station you can think of, Pandora has it!! It isn't like a real broadcast radio station, but if you type in something like Today's Adults Hits, all that station plays is today's hits! If you don't have the paid version (4 dollars a month) however, it has some ads. Oh, and another thing. You will get a lot of
 E-mails telling you what songs you like (they would know because there is an option of 4 buttons, one is Like, one is Dislike-automatically skips song- skip, and pause) and what new songs are for the season. I like the e-mails, however, even if you hate e-mails. Well, I don't have the paid version, and I think it's amazing! Seriously, get the app! No station limit, no anything but songs of your choice and a couple ads.",pandora
10/7/2013,I think this is by far the best streaming radio out there.,pandora

1/15/2013,I think this is the best!!!! I listen to this a lot. But people out there it needs wifi. BOMBASTIC,pandora
12/4/2013,I think this is wonderful however I'm not clear on how to use it or how to make and select my own music . Since it's free you can't beat it and I'm sure most people will be able to figure out how it all works.,pandora
12/6/2013,I think this need more skips and needs more albums.I want to choose my own music and artists.But its still good.,pandora

4/28/2016,"I thought I'd download the app on my kindle fire HD just to see if all the reviews were true. They. Are. True. It's very frustrating that it works on a computer but not on my kindle. When you click on the app, it just shows the beginning screen and doesn't change. I hope they fix the bugs! (I can't complain too much because the app was free, but it's still frustrating.)",pandora

2/25/2014,"I thought it was awesome until they starting putting ads up.
 Don't get me wrong, I still like it but I would've given 5 stars
 if there were no ads. It still is a great service and I would
 recommend it to anyone!",pandora
9/16/2017,"I thought it was hard to use, not what I thought it would be by the description.okay if you just want to listen to one artist at a time.",pandora
1/31/2014,I thought it was radio stations and I was lookaying for southern gospel. Instead it seems to pick out country singers singing gospel not real gospel artists.,pandora
12/28/2013,"I thought it would be nice to listen to the radio when I was waiting for someone when I had a WIFI available. I didn't realize that I had to sell my soul to do so! This app bombarded me with ads and forces you to sign in with your email address just to use it. They want to get you to buy the paid version, and it has limited options to listen to your preferred artist. It also clips the ends of many songs which I hate.
 
 The permissions list for this app is just crazy. Why should a radio app gain access to my personal data, modify my calendar and send email to guests and read my contact data. That is exceptionally invasive and I don't want to share that data with someone's server.
 
 Here is a list of the permissions on my Amazon Kindle.
 * Network communication - full internet access and create Bluetooth connections
 * Your personal information - add or modify calendar events and send email to guests, read contact data
 * Storage - modify delete internal storage contents
 * Kindle calls - read Kindle state and identity
 * System tools - Bluetooth administration, change WIFI state prevent kindle from sleeping
 * Network communication - view network state, view WIFI state
 * System tools - automatically set start at boot
 
 I just found the app to not work very well, not have the controls I wanted and its invasion of my data was over the top of what I thought was necessary to listen to the radio. I have deleted it from my Kindle Fire.",pandora
8/10/2013,"I thought Pandora would run in Panama, since Amazon made a big noise about releasing a colossal amount of content for the Kindle Fire. The first app, I tried to download and install was Pandora Radio. To my disappointment, Pandora is only available for the U.S. market.
 
 As you can imagine, I'm not a happy person, and there is not a smile on my face. Please Amazon, open up your Apps to the international market.

(unless you like lookaying at blue screens, of course) -.-",pandora
12/8/2011,"I thought this app was extremely easy to use. You set up a music style you enjoy, and Pandora does all of the work. I've encountered lots of new artists in this way.",pandora
10/9/2013,I thought this wasn't supposed to have ads. aside from quite a lot of buffering if I try and change the song and the ads at the bottom its pretty great.,pandora

 I use this all the time to listen to the latest pop music for free. All you do is lookay up a singer or song. Then, you pick a station. Then music will start playing and if you don't like the song, you can skip it.

7/26/2014,I totally like the app and the fact that I can name my own choices of music. Works for me.,pandora
9/27/2013,I travel a lot and with my computer/iphone I can listen to radio all the time no matter where I may be. I can listen to my favorite music all bundles up in one station.

3/30/2013,I tried downloading a few of the music apps in the store. Could not find any with the music I grew up with. My oldest daughter put me on to Pandora. She was right I found just what I was lookaying for . Thank you Tammy & Pandora.,pandora

That's right, even though that everything else works, the music, the #1 reason why this was made and why people bother using this is that only one thing that doesn't work. It works if you turn it off and leave it alone for an hour, but if you fiddle with it in the slightest way, the next track won't play. This is just sh*tty and weird from my experience. Oh, wait. There's one more thing that doesn't work; it's the search engine for music stations, which is also a pretty vital thing about Pandora... For those who're reading this review, I really don't recommend this...",pandora

7/25/2017,"I truly enjoy the free version of Pandora. I enjoy listening to every station of music that I create, even if there's commercial.

Which by the way I never listen to now, Pandora all the time.",pandora

5/8/2012,I turn on Pandora from my Tablet and use a jambox for the sound via Bluetooth.. I am a subscriber and pay my monthly fee. Pandora has a tendency to stop and then I have to restart. Sometimes it is really bad. (I have no problems with Radio Paradise). Mostly it is on shuffle and in spite of the fact that I have not put an arrow on Christmas songs Pandora manages to slip one in here and there. Most annoying since it is not December but March. It also is quite repetitive in the choice of music. I still give it four stars.,pandora
6/14/2017,I turn on the computer & immediately get to listen to my favorite artist--Pandora is a wonderful app. So glad I bought it.,pandora

2/11/2012,"I undersand that ads are what makes it free, which is why it is still a four star, but a new add every time you skip, or change station, as well as every three or four songs seems a little much. Interface is pretty good. If you add enough variety the stations do an decent job of fitting your tastes. Eats up data if you are not on a wifi network, but that is to be expected.",pandora
2/17/2014,"I understand developers want money. It's business. What I want is some reasonable privacy when I run an app. I like music. There are FREE apps that do a nice job, some with too many ads but many that certainly don't need my email address or login to operate. Pandora isn't one of these. It might well be a premium music app but in terms of what it wants... it's not for me.
 
 Slick interface that installs smoothly and runs well on my Kindle Fire HD. Fast download tookay forever to install. Why? TUNE IN is just as effective, annoyingly too many intrusive ads, but free and no login required.",pandora

12/21/2016,I UNI STALLED THIS APP. I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH AT ALL. IT WOULD NOT TURN OFF AND WOULD NOT LET ME ADD MORE THAN JUST A FEW SONGS,pandora
1/25/2013,I updated Pandora o. My kindle fine HD and I don't like the fact that you only get 5 hours a month to listen to music. I think this is just a way for Pandora to get people to pay for more hours.,pandora
3/12/2013,I updated the app on my kindle fire and now the app won't open. It just says Pandora but never opens.,pandora

11/2/2013,"I upgraded to Pandora|One and I absolutely love it!!! Being able to choose both genre and style of music I want to listen to; and choosing songs that I don't want to hear again, is absolutely fantastic!

3/7/2015,"I use and like Pandora and am a paid subscriber; really like accessing it on the Fire and plugging into external powered speakers or my hi-fi. Initially I found this app to be annoyingly unstable: If I tried to log into my Pandora account when first turning on the Fire, I could usually get in but sometimes it timed out before I could complete the login process or I'd get a message telling me they're experiencing problems. Anyway, there must have been an update at some point because the app has been trouble free for quite a while now and I really like it. I particularly like that there's a ""quit"" option when I want to stop it, as opposed to completely logging out. After using the ""quit"" option, when I want to get back in all I have to do is select Pandora from the Fire carousel and the app launches with no need to sign in. The alarm clock function is probably my favorite thing; very cool to wake to your own programmed music channel. Good stuff!",pandora
9/6/2013,I use Echo to access Pandora. I have asked it to play several different genres of music and it always responds with a nice variety of songs and different artists. When I ask for a particular artist it plays only songs by that artist. My only complaint is that the volume control don't control the volume of commercials at the same level as the music.. The commercials are always louder.,pandora

4/21/2014,"I use other music services too, but Pandora is a go to.
 Don't forget, that it is enjoyable to get specific music you like to listen too. It seems this will be a standard now.
 
 In order to preserve all these services, don't forget to shut it down when your not listening. Mind you, they don't pay a lot of money to the music industry per song, but those costs can build up. Act accordingly, and services like this will get better and better. Or go out of business.",pandora
8/12/2013,I use Pandora a lot at work. I can skip forward to a new song. It would be nice to skip back. I find it a bit clunky and hard to figure out how to maneuver. Also hard to figure out how to close the program.,pandora

3/31/2017,I use Pandora because of the thumbs up down system and that the service itself is free. The app is good but it could use a little help with auto scaling and scrolling for smaller and square screens. Actually most apps today don't take this screen size limitation or scaling into account and that impacts my use of the app. Otherwise good.,pandora
3/3/2013,I use Pandora classical or music to study by as background when I read my Kindles and it fits that purpose to a tea!,pandora

3/9/2016,I use Pandora everywhere I go! They seemed to have cut down on the commercials lately. If I weren't a full time student I would totally pay the price for their membership.

3/18/2014,"I use pandora in the car, on my phone, on my Kindle while reading, on my PC while while writing, as well as through my TV when I'm not watching a program. I especially like the fact that I can select a group of entertainers and shuffle the music so I get a variety of styles and performers. Only rarely do I feel the need to skip a particular song.",pandora
1/25/2012,"I use Pandora often on my computer, so I was excited to get it on my Kindle Fire HD and my daughters' tablets. While it works fine on the Android tablets, Pandora is a nightmare on the Kindle Fire. It takes forever to load (and usually multiple tries); it often stops playing for no apparent reason in the middle of songs, and may or may not resume at any given moment; and even if it does play well, when I try to turn Pandora off it won't shut off. I have to completely shut off the Kindle to get it to quit.
 
 Hopefully Pandora will soon fix this mess so I can enjoy music on my Kindle Fire. Two stars because it does, in fact, work on other tablets. DO NOT get the app if you have a Kindle.",pandora
7/24/2013,"I use Pandora on a few of my devices. I really like to use it when we have functions. The continous music with a commercial advertisement is still better than FM Radio in my local area.
 I can not upgrade app to latest upgrade for some strange reason.",pandora
7/18/2013,"I use Pandora on both my computer and Kindle. The sound is always great and the selection of music seems a good fit. I don't mind the commercials, but sometimes it simply stops and doesn't play anything.",pandora

2/16/2014,I use Pandora when I walk.,pandora
12/14/2012,"I use Pandora with my Amazon Echo more than any other streaming service. They seem to have the fewest commercials and play some great artists that relate well to the station I've chosen. To be honest I've only downloaded the app because I don't want to drag my Echo into the steamy bathroom. I use the Pandora app to pair my tablet with a waterproof speaker I listen to in the shower. I've created all my stations already with the Echo so although it works just fine all I really do with the app is scroll until I find what I want to listen to for that shower, start it playing and then walk away. It does what I need it to do and the music it picks no matter what 'station' I'm listening to is truly top notch.
 In a nutshell, I really don't do a lot with the app but it does what I need quite well.",pandora
5/19/2017,I use pithos to access this for no fee and no advertising - linux free version!!,pandora

9/22/2012,I use the free version of Pandora. Sounds great on my Samsung Galaxy player 4.2. The on screen ads don't bother me because my player turns the screen off after a few minutes so I never see them. As for the voice ads not that many in between songs. Good selection of songs in the different categories.,pandora
1/17/2013,"I use the free version so the pop ups can get in the way if I'm tryint to read song info or change the station but all of the pop ups can be closed out of. At least for 10 seconds anyway, then another one appears. Oh well, I guess I can't complain to much if it's free.",pandora
1/10/2013,"I use the paid subscription to Pandora, which as far as I am concerned is the best value around. The take-it-with-you Android app works beautifully.
 
 My only quibble is that it's hard to change your shuffle on the app, but whatever. It would be easier on a tablet, but for a mobile app, it's great. Thanks, Pandora-you're the best.",pandora
1/13/2013,"I use the Pandora app daily and have been able to find whatever music genre I need to fit my mood or act as appropriate background music while reading. Sound quality is excellent on the Fire, and the app has been almost glitch-free. One feature I really like is the ability to link to Amazon's mp3 store for an item corresponding to what you're listening to (if you like what you're hearing and want to buy it). Pandora provides amazing entertainment value on the Kindle Fire, and in my opinion has something to offer any user.",pandora
5/1/2013,I use the shuffle and shuffle options with about 50 stations and I listen every day for hours on end I will not change either this is All want but the user interface on the app could be updated for tablets,pandora

12/19/2012,"I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD 7"", my Droid X smartphone and also on the computer. It is the best ""free"" radio app on the market in my opinion because the more you listen and like certain songs that they play the more custom of a radio station you end up with. There are also not a lot of repeats which keeps things from getting boring.",pandora

1/29/2016,I use this everyday. Almost every evening before bed I get to listen some music to relax me. What's nice about it is I can choose what songs I like and they play them more often. Its nice to have the ability to modify the application to my likes.,pandora

8/17/2014,"I use this for when I'm working on the computer or reading. A lot of different channels, but I tend to have a core set of about 8-9 that I listen to all the time. Also appreciate that Pandora can be set up to play when my Kindle is in sleep mode -- helps save on the battery. It also doesn't seem to interfere with the other applications -- although it will occasionally distort slightly (not all the time) when performing certain actions on a game or pulling up e-mail.",pandora

7/6/2014,I use this with Bluetooth in my car to stream mostly jazz thru my auto's system.

5/8/2016,"I used it when I heard an artist was coming to play in our town and I was unfamiliar with their works. I plugged in the name of the artist and heard some of his works, but also heard other performers who were similar in style. As it turns out, I was familiar with some of the associated artists so it gave me a better idea if I would like to go hear the live performance of the original artist. This is a great resource for an introduction into new artists and genres.",pandora

Sorry Pandora, but your poor response to big problems has lost you another user.",pandora

6/6/2014,"I used to listen to Pandora at work about five years ago and shortly started paying for it so i didn't have to listen to ads anymore. I have never been happier with any other music source. As long as you have internet, this is the way to go 100% of the time. I listen to it at work, on my phone, in my car, my son has it on his Kindle Fire, It is the best thing that ever happened to Music. Not only can you choose the station you want and add whatever artist you want, you can tell it never to play a particular song again on that station by giving it a thumbs down. If you spend hours tweeking it over years you end up with at least two or more different genre stations that have ONLY songs you like. It also plays new songs that are similar to the artists you are listening to so that you can hear the new music coming out or artist you never heard of and never knew you loved. The design is very simple and easy to use on whatever media player you are using. It is just too great for words.",pandora

And then my Pandora started acting up, at first not very often it would just sit there after a song was done playing and it would just load, I would just go out of it and come back and it was fine, then that started becoming more frequent, and just now, I tried to go onto Pandora and every station I tried, Pandora just kept skipping all the songs, none of them would play they just kept coming on and then just skipped it, even the ads would be skipped. I tried deleting the app and put it back on, it would do the same thing. I deleted it and reinstalled it again 3 times, I tried everything, nothing would make it stop it just kept skipping all the songs.

5/18/2012,"I used to love Pandora, have enjoyed it for years and subscribed to Pandora Plus a long time ago. I used to be able to create a station, and if I encountered a song or artist elsewhere that I enjoyed I could add them to the station later using the Add Variety feature. At least I could do it on my desktop app. However, that feature has apparently been removed. So now, once I create a station it's seeds are locked and I am stuck with the option of only liking/disliking the music that the station provides.There is still a Pandora Help page on how to Add Variety, but it's instructions don't work. I will stay with Pandora only because I have so much invested in the stations that I have created. But unless and until they include Add Variety again, I would NOT recommend this to a new user. I only hope that they include it again soon.",pandora

2/6/2014,"I wanted to be able to make my own personalized music experience, but end up skipping around a bunch to get to a decent song, or just going to Youtube instead. It seems when I choose an artist for a channel, that artist gets played like once a day. Sometimes I get music I don't like and that aren't even close to the channels artist, and when I down vote them I keep getting more of their songs. The ads are annoying too, to say the least. It could be much better, but they have to pay their bills somehow. I will from now on just buy my own songs instead.
 Pros: free music, a variety of music, introduces you to new songs or artists you may like.
 Cons: very limited, not very big on custom tuning the channels to your preference, intrusive ads every other song, irrelevant songs often.",pandora

1/14/2017,I was about to buy a new MP3 player but needed music now. I down loaded Pandora and within minutes was listening to great music. Easy to use very intuitive let's you like and dislike songs to cater to what you want to hear.,pandora
1/21/2014,"I was amazed at the selection of music available for no cost to me. I am truly happy my niece got me started with Pandora.

7/15/2016,"I was amazing got to know Pandora, that it was from my friend introduce to me, it is easy to find out favorite sort of music and have beautiful sound quality.",pandora
8/29/2015,"I was an early adopter of Pandora. I was very happy to see the app come to Android; to discover that my channels and preferences were maintained on my tablet just made things even better. This and Spotify are my two current music apps - Spotify for when I want to find a specific song, and Pandora for when I just want to listen to songs that I like, and to be surprised.",pandora
4/8/2013,I was disappointed that when I asked for a single artist I still got a mix. Over all it is great....very few commercials.,pandora
11/27/2012,I was excited to see that Pandora was available for my kindle hd after being an avid user on my pc. I have become very disappointed with this app because of a constant loading issue. It will work a couple of times then it won't load. I've deleted/downloaded this app so many times it's becoming a chore. Please fix this! Don't make me go back to iheart radio!,pandora
8/27/2016,"I was excited when Pandora became available for smartphones, and have been using it on my Android for a long time without any problems. Recently got a Kindle Fire and, again, it's great.
 
 Unfortunately, recently it has had the tendency to occasionally start a song and freeze and skip after about 20 seconds. Also, I understand the need for ads, but recently they've gotten a bit overnumerous and repetitive.
 
 But I love Pandora; it introduces you to new music, lets you customize your station based on the type of music you like, and the fact that you can now listen to Pandora without the 40-hour limit per month makes it only better.
 
 I only wish the ads were a little shorter, more varied, and maybe a little less often. Also, the slight buginess needs to be addressed. But still, a solid app, especially for fans of Pandora online just getting smartphones or tablets. Four stars, easily.",pandora
12/27/2013,"I was hesitant at first before buying the app, but I fell in love with Pandora. I have come across artists I have never listened to and really liked what I heard. Only thing I would change is the amount of skips I am allowed. I think if I pay for it, I should be able to skip songs whenever I want. Overall I love love love this app!!!!",pandora
1/13/2012,I was impressed by this and so wasn't my husband. Can listen to all your favorite music for free. has a few adds but you can by pass lookaying at it or listening to it. I would recommend.,pandora
8/23/2013,I was introduced to Pandora by a friend and fell in love with it. I constantly listened to music on it. then one day I was cleaning my room and had been listening for a while then an artist that I do NOT like came on I tried to dislike it but the song continuedbto to play so I tried to skip it but I had already used the 6 skips in one hour the app is a great idea yet very expenseive and sucks battery I would have made this a five star review yet I just couldn't because if all the troubles I've had with this app.,pandora
12/28/2013,"I was introduced to pandora by my son-in-law, and I just love it. Very versatile; I like the different songs on it.",pandora
8/15/2013,"I was introduced to Pandora when I bought my Rokayu about 2-3 years ago. I am so tired of traditional radio, hearing the same old stuff from 40 years ago, even current music, they play to death. With Pandora, even if you chose a musical group from 40 years ago, you can hear all of their tracks, not just the ones they play on traditional radio. You also will hear musical groups from the same Genre. You can chose any group you like. Pandora offers an upgrade without commercials, even if you get free Pandora, the commercials/ads are not that long, and you are back to hearing your favorite music. I recommend Pandora to everyone!",pandora
7/25/2013,"I was listening to a station while doing my homework and skipped a song and the previous song wad still playing. so know I was stuck listening to a song that I don't want. and also every time I skip a song, the same spainish ad came on..ready to delete next screw up",pandora

12/17/2013,"I was not successful in getting it to download onto my kindle fire hd at first, although I was able to get it onto my smart phone and computer. Initially, I wasn't able to find out why it wouldn't load, so I thought I would be unable to give it a good rating. But now it is loaded, and I am perfectly delighted.",pandora
7/17/2016,I was playing some music when I decided to change stations. This trailer video poped up showing some demen girls that scare the hell out of me. I'm still shaking... adds pop up sometimes.... to me I say goodbye pandora.,pandora
12/1/2012,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that Pandora included the likes of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and many others of my favorites. Nevertheless, there is something here for everyone, as the numbers of musical genres and artists appears almost endless.",pandora
1/13/2013,"I was reading the reviews while Pandora got downloaded on my kindle, then I open it, and... It didn't work on Peru. Yes, I am in Peru and I talk English pretty well, and I am American. Yeah, confusing. But the point is that it doesn't work everywhere. It just works in the US.
 Bam, they got me. I usually give good reviews, but I couldn't even use it, so, what's the point?
 Thanks, and put useful to this review, please.
 Oh, I think you'd like hotspot fm. Lookay for I, it's free.

1/28/2014,I was satisfied,pandora
2/14/2014,I was so enjoying this app. I then received notice an update was available. In the midst of the update something went wrong now the app won't open. I erased it from my kindle & deleted it in the cloud. Days later I reloaded the app and it still doesn't work. I am so disappointed.,pandora
12/30/2014,I was surprised at how easy it is to use; though I dislike these reviews due to need for too many words. I will continue to explore the benefits and offerings. I was slightly disappointed that a few of my favorite artists/songs were not available.,pandora
7/16/2013,I was surprised at the ease of use of Pandora. I like music and I am able to enjoy it on my Kindle,pandora
9/21/2013,I was surprised to find how easy this was to download and use. I would recommend it very much. much fun.,pandora
7/29/2013,I was thanked politely for downloading it and refuse admission at registration.,pandora

10/17/2012,"I was under the impression that the music available on the Echo was free. However, I found I had to subscribe to the Amazon Music Unlimited to get the music (which was the reason I bought the item). There appears to be no mixing on the sequence of songs by artists. When I ask for a specific artist, it seems to always start with the same song. The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good. I will caution those who ask me about the Echo's need for subscribed music.",pandora
9/1/2013,I was using the free Pandora with the ads and my husband told me about this. I really like that I don't have to deal with advertisements while listening to my music.,pandora
6/9/2017,"I was very disappointed at all the advertisements that came with the Pandora music app. And to be asked to pay $4.99 per month to keep the advertisements off? I don't think so. I really do like my I Heart Radio. I guess I should have just stuck with that. But, I gave it a try.",pandora
1/24/2014,"I was very excited to get the Kindle Pandora app. It is very nice to play music while I cookay using the online recipes found on Pinterest or various other websites on my Kindle. The only thing I wasn't sure about was how to quit Pandora at first. There is a Quit option, but you must be on the main screen (the one that displays your stations) to utilize it. My Kill app wasn't even able to shut it down. I try to conserve battery life as much as possible. Once I found that Quit option I was much happier with the app.",pandora

11/21/2013,"I was very happy when I discovered the Pandora app for my new Kindle Fire. However I came to realize. It only works when it what's to. It works great for one day, and if you try to use it the next day. It freezes on you. So disappointing!",pandora

5/2/2013,"I wasn't aware that I purchased Pandora and am not sure how to install or use it. I have an iPhone, iPad, and Kindle Fire. Am I able to access Pandora on all three? Are there instructions, and how much was spent for this purchase? Thank you for your assistance.",pandora

11/5/2014,"I wish I had unlimited listening on this, if I did I would use it more. As it is, I use up my time, switch to one of the other freebies, and then forget to switch back. So I only listen now and then. (Advertisers are you listening?)",pandora

3/3/2014,I wish it was unlimited with how much u can use it.but no problems its fun and enjoyable i like music and you get 40 hours,pandora
6/23/2016,I wish it wasn't so repetitive.,pandora
5/8/2013,I wish it would just be sam smith and that's it,pandora
6/3/2015,I wish Pandora would allow me to pick the specific music I want to hear. I guess it wasn't designed to do that. So it's just a three star review from me.,pandora
11/5/2015,"I wish that I had all my music choices in my head when I need them, because I know that Pandora will play them. Plus more! It is VERY nice to get rid of the commercials! And at a bargain price.",pandora
12/25/2012,I wish the ads on the free version were just the banners instead of the voice-over ads. But other than that I LOVE Pandora.,pandora
2/18/2013,"I wish the like/ dislike was more intuitive. I HATE live music, but after I dislike a number of them by the same artist, it thinks I dont like the artist.DUH!",pandora
7/10/2013,I wish there was a better selection of songs on some channels and there were no ads...but it's free...so what are we really able to complain about! I would have given 5 stars if it worked properly on my Android too.,pandora
9/24/2013,"I wish they sold a subscription to have music w/out commercials. I get so tired of Geico commercials. But I like being able to like songs, and when you dislike them the song stops immediately: I like that.",pandora

5/1/2017,"I work cleaning horse stalls every day for 3 hours. I listen to several of the stations, commerical free. All station repeat the same music. I used a competor for awhile but even the fee based product dropped the wifi periodically. Pandora one - keeps me connected, with good quality. I get the signal on my IPHONE and play it on a Bose radio. In my case well worth the money",pandora
3/29/2016,I work in a cubicle where I get a lot of distracting noise from a nearby conference room and other cubicles near me. Listening to music on Pandora has helped me block out the distractions and focus on my work. Great selection of music and ability to customize your stations. The only issue is that it eats up a lot of bandwidth on my phone if I am not on wifi...just need to make sure your device is on wifi.,pandora
3/14/2013,"I work in a Dental office, and ALL of us listen to Pandora. It has music for all ages and is so easy to use.",pandora
4/8/2013,I would absolutely recommend Pandora. One can tune it to one's own likes and dislikes very easily. I thoroughly enjoy this app.,pandora

4/23/2012,I would give in 5 stars but I don't like the skip limit ????????. but over all I give it a ??,pandora
1/9/2012,"I would give it 5 stars but I dont like that you can only skip so many songs per channel and I thought that when you bookaymark a song it goes to a folder that you can play at any time. It doesnt though. Other than that, I like it so far. I have only had it for a week.",pandora
5/18/2015,"I would give it 5 stars, if, when searching for a song, or creating a station based on a song, that song is played first, so I know I've chosed the right song/artist. Another reason for the less than perfect rating is the commericals. I understand the need for them, but not more than once every 3 songs. And not the same commercial every other time. I just shut it off and switch back to regular radio at that point. The final issue is buffering. Mine does that a lot, right in the middle of the song sometimes.",pandora
10/30/2015,"I would give it a 4.9 rating if I could because of the advertising which seems to pop up at inconvenient spots, but I'm too cheap to spring for the paid subscription since I don't listen to the app all that regularly.",pandora
1/23/2014,I would give pandora 10 stars. I have siriusxm and it doesn't compare. You can select the artiste or type of music and it will play so much better than listening to music you don't care for.,pandora
5/17/2013,I would give Pandora 5 stars they keep me updated with new music and artist I never heard of introducing me to new sounds I probably wouldn't have heard of.,pandora
1/26/2013,"I would give pandora 5 stars, it's an awesome way to listen to music, if it was working without me having to shut down my kindle every time I wanted to use it. I can literally turn it on, listen to one song, turn it off, and try again and it won't work. It just shows the blue loading screen. Every single time. I want to use it, but I've used already this time? Shut down my kindle, and hope it works.",pandora
11/11/2016,I would give the app five stars but it didn't have the status bar to tell how much longer the song is but still a great app!!!!!! :),pandora
10/9/2013,I would give this a 5 star rating but it is not as intuitive as I would like. Plus it freezes my phone every once in a while.,pandora
3/10/2012,I would give this five stars but if I type in the name of a song it would be nice to hear that song or at least songs by the same musicians.,pandora
12/12/2012,I would give this five stars if IT WOULD EVEN WORK!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHH it's so frustrating. I want to give it five stars but I can't,pandora
3/18/2015,"I would give this nine stars, just like the nine nine nine plan. The 999 plan replaces the tax code with the simple but effective 999 plan. Pandora is great because it shows you new artists like the ones you love",pandora
11/15/2013,"I would have given a better review of Pandora , but my music gets interrupted by someone's greed by charging me for free ads . if it is truly my station then allow me to have ads if I like . if not please , let it be without them . otherwise great concept !",pandora

3/3/2016,I would highly recommend this app because you can always listen to music and you can put the cover on your kindle and it will keep playing music!,pandora
4/17/2013,I would like it better if I get to choose the songs instead of the genre. Just not for me.,pandora
10/1/2013,"I would like more choice for artist not just their popular songs, album list. After listening you begin to hear the same songs over and over again almost like commercial radio.",pandora

7/10/2014,I would rate it a five if I could get onto it. It won't let me open on my Fire. I'd really like to hear my thumbprint radio.,pandora
7/9/2015,I would rather choose just the artist I select...rather than Pandora choosing other artists they think I might like to hear too.,pandora
9/14/2017,"I would really love more skips. So would all of my friends.
 Less adds of course,the usual complaint.
 A replay or repeat button, which I think half of the internet would like.

1/6/2017,"I would recommend Pandora to all of my friends and family. There is music there for everyone. Sincerely, Bobee Hoffstatter.",pandora
9/14/2015,I would recommend slacker radio if you want to listen to your favourite music but pandora is great for finding new bands that you will most likely be into,pandora
1/31/2013,I would recommend this app to all who are Pandora users.It is another way to discover new music you might not other wise be exposed to.,pandora
2/18/2013,I would recommend this for anyone even kids they can have their own station. With this only they do curse so be careful on the adults songs for kids okay thank you,pandora
6/5/2013,"I would recommend this product to any one, any age, or any gender. The variety of music is fun to choose from, their customer service is wonderful, they actually e mail you once you sign up to see if you like it and ask for feedback!",pandora
7/14/2013,I would recommend this to anyone that I know that has Kindle. I was surprised at the quality of music on my Kindle.,pandora
6/27/2013,I would say one of the best music apps out there. Needs some better algorithms to explore new music.,pandora

2/9/2017,Id give it zero stars if I could. The app will randomly stop playing. and they want us to pay for the ad free version? I think not! Time to go find a new music player now.,pandora

12/22/2013,"I'd never be able to broaden my horizons if not for Pandora. I don't even bother with owning an archive anymore. However, the song selection is a bit limited, and some of the hoops Pandora has to jump through to keep its numerous license-holders happy end up putting odd quirks in the program. It will never be Spotify, but it's not enough to detract from the program, and Pandora One is dirt-cheap compared to other advertisement-free tiers in other programs.
 
 Despite any possible shadows of disadvantage, Pandora has changed my relationship with music.",pandora

12/31/2011,If I could figure all of this out I bet this would be a swell way to organize my tunes.,pandora

It is thorough in her descriptions both of women and and the soldiers of Caesar's armies. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Pandora is one of Anne's vampire bookays but like all her vampire bookays, the characters are much more than just vampires and she develops them so that the reader sees them as human as well as vampire with the human still dominating their lives as they struggle with their new identities.",pandora

8/16/2013,"If you are a music lover then I highly recommend this app. It is free! Name any type of music and you will find it on Pandora. It's practically like a radio station but if you don't like the song, you can skip it. Beware, you are limiting to only 6 skips per hour.",pandora
4/5/2017,"If you are a music lover,you gotta have Pandora! Put it on all your devices,includig whatever tablet you have,Worth every penny!",pandora
6/29/2013,If you are able to afford Pandora One it is worth it! Regular Pandora is frustrating to listen to with all the commercial interruptions..just my opinion,pandora
2/26/2013,"If you are familiar with Pandora, then I can tell you that this app is a good version of the web based Pandora for your phone. Once you log in, it syncs with your account and shows all of your stations.
 
 Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.
 
 You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour (although it is not unlimited).
 
 However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $4.99 monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""
 
 There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for $0.99. That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.
 
 This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are lookaying for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.
 
 The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on (for example, only on weekdays). It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.
 
 There is also a ""sleep timer"" that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval (currently 15, 30, or 60 minutes) so that the app doesn't play music all night while you sleep.",pandora
2/3/2016,"If you are fine with a little randomness, this is perfect for you. I have found new songs and new artists I like now due to this app. However, there are a few problems:
 40 hour limit: for mobile devices, you get 40 hours of music per week. That's a little over 5 hours per day, which is good if you don't listen to as much as I do (I'm almost constantly listening to music)
 Ads: not too bad, the limit is what gets me. What annoys me a little, however is that I think the ads are included in your limit.
 
 Sure, they give a couple good solutions. The first option is to pay a dollar for unlimited music, but that's just for a month. Second is Pandora One, which is the dollars a month if I remember right. If you have access to a computer, that's the best option in my opinion. However, getting it on mobile is also nice for when a computer isn't on and ready.",pandora

12/6/2016,"if you had trouble changing the station(on the Kiele fire) then try go down below to where the home botton is and hit the botton in the middle with lines or the one that lookays like a list and it will give you options. just play around with it and you will find it, or if you just change to the station just hit the back botton.
 
  now yes there are advertisements that play after 3-4 songs but the only way Pandora will be free is if they do those advertisements. they only last about 30 seconds.
  i have left my kindle fire on all night once with Pandora playing and it did not die. if you leave it playing but hit the power bottom the screen will turn off but music. still play letting you save more battery power.

6/19/2014,"I'm a late-comer to Pandora. I subscribed about a month ago and have told my friends about it because it's made a big improvement in my life. That sounds melodramatic but it's true. I have always been a music lover and studied classical piano seriously when I was young. A few years ago I developed a physical condition that required me to quit working, limit my driving and avoid crowds. I'm living on a shoestring. And I live way out in the sticks. There's no cell reception, cable or public transportation here. On Pandora I set up six stations to fit my taste in music. The first day I set up a station combining piano jazz and classical piano. I listened to it day in and day out until I felt satisfied. Next I went to blues and folk. Yesterday I listened to my favorite rock + roll for hours and learned about music that is new to me. That's part of the reason I like Pandora so much -it combines what I know with new choices. Also, the quality of Pandora 's sound is first rate.

I have downloaded it on all my devices.",pandora

 There is a great choice of genres so that I can enjoy all types of music I normally wouldn't have on a play list and try them out e.g. New Age, Indie, Christian, Latin, etc. I would highly recommend Pandora to anyone who loves music and if you don't want the ads, you can pay $3.99 per month, that is, about $1.00 a week for great non-stop entertainment.",pandora
4/25/2013,I'm so wondering does this app &#34;Pandora&#34; have to have WiFi to work? Hmm,pandora
2/5/2014,I'm sorry but I recommend iheart radio. It is so much better. Pandora always freezes when I want to hear a song advertisements pop up and end clicking that instead of a thumps up or down. Iheart radio is simple and easy. But then again it's not my choice,pandora
10/14/2015,I'm sorry but way too many adds.I just can't use it anymore.so I use spotify.I am actually listening to it while I review.and I can tell you there where no ads for a whopping 15 minutes.compared to Pandora that is such a big difference.,pandora
12/28/2014,I'm sorry that I couldn't make this any better but it doesn't do what I thought it was supposed to do. I wanted to make a play list with an artist.

5/17/2017,I'm very impressed with this app. I listen every day and was very upset when I messed up and couldn't figure out what I did wrong to not get Pandora. I would and have recomended this app too several people. Thank you for fleeting my problem and have Pandora back.,pandora

 Any suggestions?",pandora

5/3/2012,"In my limited consideration I find Pandora to be an excellent source of pop music. Like everyone else, commercials are becoming common in free Pandora. Still, I have enjoyed Pandora for many years and appreciate how they figure what music suits my taste.",pandora

4/12/2012,"In my opinion this product beats all. I like the fact that I can select a band that I like, to create a station. Once it is started only bands that are in a similar genre are played. To be fair, the only other one I have tried was Slacker, and that was before I found Pandora. Once I found it I didn't need to lookay anywhere else.",pandora
6/21/2016,"In my opinion, Pandora is a great way to listen to any genre of music. And now, they have an alarm clock so you can listen to your favorite stations as you wake up! And best of all, it's free! I highly recommend it.",pandora
12/30/2012,"In spite of any ads for Pandora, song selections are limited. Stations must be ""tuned in."" To get a station to lat the music you want it is necessary to pay attention to what you are playing, reject songs not of that artist or genre, and accept songs that are appropriate.",pandora

12/26/2014,"In the first place, I NEVER ordered this app. I have no idea why it shows as being ordered by me, because I never do social media. The only redeeming thing about this whole episode is that it didn't cost me anything. I guess I'm going to have to find out who has hacked my account, and take whatever violent action may be necessary.",pandora
5/29/2014,"In the interest of full disclosure, I don't have a Kindle Fire. But, if I did, Pandora would be the first App I'd put on it. (I'm here investigating it for a friend.)
 
 Pandora is the best thing to happen to music since the electric guitar was invented. I use it almost every day - at work on my PC or my iPod, at home on my TiVo HD (over my home audio system where it sounds awesome), and on the road over my Android phone. It takes a little tuning to create unique, individual stations. You have to carefully choose seed songs & artists and ""thumb up"" songs that match the station concept and ""thumb down"" songs that don't, even it you like the song. Otherwise, all of your stations start to sound alike.
 
 Create one variety station where you ""thumb up"" everything you like and ""thumb down"" everything you don't like and Pandora will zero in on exactly what your kind of music is (and even describe it to you). That will be your favorite station (like having your own personal radio station). But also, create different stations for different moods or situations and ""prune"" them (using the web site) by removing songs from the ""thumbs up"" that don't belong there when a station starts to drift too much.
 
 I pay the small annual fee to get no commercials. worth every penny.",pandora
4/19/2016,In the past I would have given it a 5 star rating but the commercials are growing!,pandora
12/22/2011,"In the short amount of time I spent on Pandora the first time, I was able to find a mess of songs and artists that I enjoy. Now I just need the time to go back for more. I couldn't find my favorite Christmas CD at home, but found some pleasant music to listen to on a very snowy holiday complete with a crackling fire !!!",pandora

11/28/2016,"It doesn't matter if I listen to a station for 3 hours or 20; I can thumbs up and down all day long and still it plays the same 20 songs by the same10 artist. I normally listen everyday while I get ready for work. I'm so sick of some songs and artists by the end of the week I have to delete them from the station: Katy Perry, Lady GaGa, Journey, Hootie and The Blowfish, Goo Goo Dolls and LL Cool J are this weeks victims. Everytime I click any station it's the same five songs that start it. Every. Single. Time. This is great when Iove a new tund. It's torture otherwise. The whole app is more often than not, a waste to me. Sure, I like that song but I dont want to hear it every single day in almost the exact order. I'll just listen to the radio if I want the same stuff over and over. I have about 10 stations I made, 5-10 others made and there is no difference between how often it overplays each song. I've tried the shuffle feature and somehow end up with Christmas music every 3rd song. There used to be an ""add variety"" feature but I've had no luck finding it on my Kindle. The app, for me, is only good for very limited use. Likewise, I don't always have limitless hours to thumbs up or down so on some stations that has made the listening experience almost painful. I used to appreciate the Genome aspect for finding songs I would enjoy. Now it's just a hassle.",pandora

8/10/2014,It is a great app. You get to listen to a variety of music and it's free. But it is really frustrating how often it reopens after just pausing it. I often pause because we like the song and something is making it hard to hear and then there is no way to get back to it. It also happens when it disconnects from a blue tooth device.

 You create a station with classical piano and soon u will be hearing Jerry Lee Lewis.Nothing against him but I guess you get the point.
 Another enervating thing is u turn on ur Pandora and go to work in the garage or yard and half an hour later the music stops, u go back in the house and u see a message from Pandora ""Are you still listening?"" WT#*%$???
 And unless u get the paid version, u cannot do many editings (ie Liking or Disliking or FF a song).
 If u can put up with that, it's okay then.",pandora

5/3/2015,"It is okayay. If you want to listen to one or two bands that you like, this works.
 
 This app has too many commercials compared to other apps of its type.
 
 The customization based on likes and dislikes is terrible. For 2, maybe 3, songs after you hit ""like"" it will play similar sounding songs, but it has gone far off track far more times than I would like.
 
 Pandora also does not carry nearly as many unheard of bands as another app that I frequently use.",pandora
5/29/2013,It is one of the greatest apps ever created in the entire world. There is nothing that can come close to this app.,pandora
2/21/2014,"It is outstanding to fill the air with those sounds that make your heart sing. If Pandora had not been started, someone would need to do so quickly",pandora

11/4/2013,"It is so handy and generally good that I wonder what I did before this was around. I less frequently listen to my recorded music now. The items I would suggest be added are less of a criticism than ways to improve the service. Of course one limitation is that not all past and present music is included in their library. That is a major issue and one I know the folks at Pandora are constantly trying to mitigate by signing new contracts. Cache would be nice, on par with Slacker. Other than that I think they are doing things right and will be around for a very long time.",pandora
4/15/2015,It is so much better just buying the subscription so no commercials are played and the sound quality is awesome. I play it just about anywhere I can. i did love the sleep setting but the last update has removed it (Or I just can't find it on the new home page).,pandora

 and re-download from the cloud to get it to work again - after reinstalling you get the login screen
 like you would if you had logged off.

8/23/2017,It said that it is having technical difficulties,pandora
2/4/2014,It seemed to know what songs I would enjoy.,pandora
7/24/2015,It seems that Pandora reads your mind. It knows what you wanna hear. You know when you say ''this station was made for me''? Pandora is 100 times better !,pandora

2/10/2014,"It starts and stops at the weirdest times. I'm all happy enjoying my music and then it will stop. I'm not that happy about this.

5/12/2016,"It sucks that you can't actually play a song that you want when you want. It sucks that even if you pay you still have a limited number of skips. BUT, it does have some of the best variety of music of the streaming apps. I use it when I just need background music going. Google Play Music All-Access is a much better alternative, but you have to fork over $9.99/month for that so its not for everybody.",pandora
12/11/2012,"It sucks! Every time I change songs, a freaking old navy ad pops up and it won't let me skip it!!!!!!!!!!!",pandora

11/16/2013,It suggests music similar to the choice you make. So you find new music you may never have heard. It is free so they won't let you listen to any song on demand.,pandora

2/8/2014,"It tookay a while for it to first start up but the app is working fine now, easy to navigate and of course; still the only downside are the ads, but that's because I'm too cheap to get the paid version. XP",pandora
9/5/2013,"It tookay awhile to figure out the ins and outs of operating this app but I do love it now and it was not hard to figure it all out. These Entertainers can really cut a rug on videos and albums but some of them need more experience to entertain live shows. Don't get me wrong but they need better instruments also and lots of ORIGINAL RIFFS to grab that Brass Ring.
 I wish all of our musicians the very best...",pandora
9/7/2013,"It tookay me a while to really love Pandora. I don't know why. Having some control over what music you want to hear just sounded too good to be true. It really is as simple as that. Well, Pandora, I think I love you.
 
 I use this app on my Kindle Fire. I love just about everything. One thing I wish that app could do is show the list of the songs I have 'thumbs upped'. As far as I know, this app cannot do that. Also, hate the ads...but I deal with them for free awesome radio.",pandora

12/29/2016,"It used to be nice when it was 30 dollars for a year of premium. But now a price increase, more ads and commercials with the basic make this not worth loading at all.",pandora
5/25/2013,It used to let me skip 6 songs per station now it only lets me skip 6 for all my stations combined.,pandora
5/5/2016,"it used to work nicely on my G-Tab (honeycomb), but since this last update I only get a blue screen. hopefully this will get resolved soon? I am at a loss for how to rate this because before it was just fine.

12/26/2016,it was a five star at first but now that u have to pay makes me angry! but reallywhy would u pay all I wanna do is Alston's to music while I clean my room or get ready for school...when music is playing I feel more cofertable and in my own world sortta. please make it cheap again!!!!!! many would agree with me,pandora

9/14/2016,It works exactly as I expected,pandora
5/11/2015,"It works fine but the style of songs are based on genre or poularity, not on sound. It gets annoying with all the adds and there is no point in a skip limit! Doesn't adhere well to your music taste at all.",pandora

7/23/2016,It works.A little slow to load page by page but it is all there if you have a little patience. I will use it daily except Sunday when I have the real thing delivered.,pandora
5/15/2013,It would be a 5 star review if there wasn't a limit on the number of songs you can skip.,pandora
1/8/2014,It would be a five star app were it not for the stopping then starting again. It may be the router speed causing it also.,pandora
10/8/2013,It would be better if I was able to have more options when use it on my amazon TV stick.,pandora
12/28/2013,it would be better if you could just play the artist that you have instead of the radio at times.,pandora
8/22/2015,It would be better if you were allowed more skips,pandora
1/24/2013,It would be better with no ads.,pandora
11/21/2014,It would be nice if you could pick your specific song list like grooveshark but it's still an AWESOME alternative to commercial radio!,pandora
8/2/2015,"It would be nice to be able to add more of your own artists. Since it does all of the selecting, I can't listen to some of my favorite artists.",pandora
4/19/2014,"it would be way better without commercials, and no I'm not willing to pay for that privilege.",pandora

10/9/2017,Its a bit clunky when reviewing artist information,pandora
2/19/2013,Its a bit of a hassle to get the music you want --you can ask for it and they will eventually play it --but they play a lotofo what they want to play in between your music--and also turn themselves off ifi you dn't click and watch an add now and then--I would use Spotify if it would load on my KINDLE FURE,pandora

And you have to create a Pandora account or sign in with an existing one. :P And you can only use it while connected to the internet, which makes sense, but is a bit of a bummer. No airplane mode with this one! It tookay me a little time to figure out how to navigate, but it's fairly simple, so I think I've got the basics down. The best part is that you can run this in the background while you do other things on your Kindle; I like to listen as I read, especially since I haven't gotten my own music onto my Fire yet. I think it's best suited for people already familiar with Pandora, but I recommend it for anyone who's online and wants some music!",pandora
2/26/2013,"It's free, with only three or four ads per hour. You pick an artist and it sets up a channel playing music by them or in a similar genre. What's to complain about?",pandora

1/8/2014,its give my kids bad names and then they repet the words hats it so much I hats it I hats it I hats it.I don't like it,pandora
6/5/2014,It's going on my Kindle whenever I'm in the sewing studio - which is 5 or 6 hours a day. Easy to change channels and easy to eliminate the songs I really don't like.,pandora
12/30/2012,It's good,pandora
8/9/2013,It's good and all but I don't like if you want to go to persons radio sometimes it plays someone music 3stars,pandora

11/27/2013,it's good but pandora curses. you can also only have a certain amount of skips but it is okay. i do like how you can create stations and flip through them. you can also use it on the interweb which is also very helpful,pandora
10/20/2017,It's good But some times it doesn't put on the song you like or not the right song but it has a awesome 4 stars and I think it's pretty good but if you get mad go on youtube. But it plays by it self when it turns off and you can shut it off without putting in the password. Like I said it has good features thanks for reading my interview,pandora

12/16/2014,"It's good but when I turn on allow explicit content it says changes made, but all the songs are still clean. Fix that please",pandora
8/18/2013,"Its good so far wish i could play back my fav songs without going through all the radio stations, but i like the continuous play dont like tht they stop u from skipping",pandora
5/26/2015,"It's good to be able to reach back to the vocalists and musicians of the 40s and further. Particularly the composers and lyricists who wrote for them. I especially love the jazz sounds of the smaller combos as well as the rhythms behind the likes of Clooney, Christie, etc., etc..",pandora
2/5/2016,It's good to have all my old favorites to listen to. I have been a listener for a few years now. The only negative to Pandora is it seems to mix stations with other favorite channels. Such as the B52's and Jethro Tull on the same channel.,pandora

This app easily plays in the background while reading an e-bookay or surfing the web.

3/28/2015,"It's very easy to get in a musical rut, playing the same album, playlist or group over and over. Pandora combats this. What first seems a shortcoming, limiting the number of songs from a given artist it can play in a time period, is actually it's best feature. Pandora does a good job of selecting other music similar to your original criteria. What's really amazing is, as you give more feedback about what you like and don't like, it does an uncanny job of selecting tunes that appeal to your taste. I know Pandora advertises this proprietary feature up front but I'm really amazed at how well it works.
 On the down side, the Windows interface is great, clean and user friendly, but I find the Android version on my phone a challenge. Part of the problem is my big fingers, poor eyesight and penchant for bright sunshine. Still, I think they should take that into account in a mobile app.",pandora

No notice. No email or anything explaining the change. Just BAM! Sorry, you can't do that anymore. When I contacted them they didn't seem to overly care that they made this change without any notice. They were willing to log me out of any and all devices and force me to change my password but to be able to stream on two devices at the same time meant paying for another account (at a higher rate). I would now have TWO accounts. One paying the same I'd paid for the last four years: $3.99 and the new account paying MORE at $4.99. No thanks.",pandora

Being ""introduced"" to other similar artists is fine a lot of the time but there are times when I want to listen to only who I want to listen to. The only downside is that if the Internet goes down, so does the music. Overall, I'm pleased with Pandora and listen to it for much of the day, most days.

I have been stunned at the well coordinated genres of music that has been combined on My Own radio station.

The only reason that Slacker may hags fewer ads is that (a) they can't find the advertisers and (b) they haven't burned through their capital yet.

I'm not sure if it's just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on high(I have unlimited data, so it's not a problem for me). It's free so it's worth it but if you're thinking of getting Pandora One(Premium Membership) that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it's a lot better in my opinion.",pandora

It tookay 2 weeks for a newer version to be available for download, after downloading the newer version the program stopped crashing (buffering errors and freezing). The one other thing that bothers me is that Pandora will not let you skip as many songs as you want, even though you are a paid subscriber. I understand they have to pay for every song played or skipped, but I'm paying them to be able to skip at my leisure and they wont allow it. The stations I create are always compiled great and the thumb print radio feature plays all my likes, which is really cool.

12/9/2012,"Ive had Pandora One for over a year, and it was great. I enjoyed it. I wasn't a fan that you were still limited with how many songs you could skip but I can deal.
 For the past three months Ive had ongoing issues with one of my stations that should be playing Today's Hits... normally it plays the newest hits that you find on the current radio and new music. Lately its been playing weird folk music. I've sent numerous emails and have gotten responses ranging from ""we're sorry"" to ""its working as expected"", well its not working as expected. I shouldn't have to thumbs down the same songs more than once on the same station... twice in a row, I shouldn't have to thumbs down it more than once ever on the same station. they seem to hope Ill just give up.
 My thought is if I'm paying 5 a month for something I expect you to make an effort to fix the issue. Its only one station with the issue, and I cant even delete the station and set it up again... it simply opens the old one back up.
 
 Come on Pandora, you can do better. Your service has gone downhill.",pandora

5/9/2014,I've used Pandora before it went mainstream. It's always had phenomenal variety of genres yet simple for all users. A must have for both professional or social application.,pandora

6/16/2017,"I've used Pandora for many years. It's one of the only websites I remember off bat when getting ready to hear some music off line. The best site, it lookayed like from the best search engine and now my perspective. I believe I chose the best one. It's not complicated to navigate or anything. I built a playlist on the video hosting site, youtube.com, bases off the best songs pandora.com was playing for me. It's called Christine's Music Playlist. It has a link and over 400 songs that are all favorites. Pandora really is the best of the web.",pandora

3/2/2016,ive used this app for around a year now but lately ive been using my kindle fire. and i noticed that when a commercial came on it would stop all the music and the loading icon came on.but it never played it so i would have to change to a different station. and then go back to it. it cant be my internet because its always full bars. so i dont know whats going on. so ya. it would be apprecieated if you could maybe see if you could fix this,pandora
9/16/2016,"I've used this app for many years and the only disappointment is the time restriction. It's just me, the fee is not high, just that after 38 years my wife finally made me practical. I enjoy and use Pandora as often as I can.",pandora
11/29/2012,"I've used this website on my PC, and Phone and now on my Kindle. I'm now a Pandora One member. I love that it plays my favorite music and I can listen anywhere. Thank you Pandora !!

9/1/2017,"Like many other recent reviewers said, the app doesn't work on kindle fire (or at least not on mine and theirs). Everything but the actual music will work -- I can see the songs playing, they just don't make any noise despite having the volume up. I'm disappointed and I hope they offer a solution soon.",pandora
10/22/2015,"Like many people, when I first heard of the concept of ""free music"" I rushed to download this Pandora app. And for a while, it met all my needs. However, there is a better player in town now and his name is Spotify Music. If you just want random background noise (random music) that you have little control over, then sure...Pandora will suffice. But if you want to actually pick the song (and not just the genre!) of what you are going to listen to...then you want Spotify Music .
 
 If you still aren't convinced though, a few more facts to help you make your decision:

3/30/2014,"Many prior reviewers have bemoaned the number of ads on Pandora stations, to which I reply: So? The ads are less frequent, less lengthy, and less disruptive than on a typical Clear Channel broadcast station. Considering the number and range of songs Pandora provides, and that royalties consume much more of digital radio's revenue than broadcast, I don't begrudge them paying for themselves. Since the ads aren't loud, I can handle a few interruptions.
 
 I'm more impressed by the fact that Pandora offers a wide array of music in nearly every genre, including music too edgy or dangerous for conglomerate-owned media outlets. Especially for those of us who live in the hinterlands, Pandora provides an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with music we would never otherwise encounter. I've been able to broaden my exposure to indie rock, international and ethnic music, daring composers, and innovative singer-songwriters.
 
 And getting it for my smartphone has been a real boost. I'm able to connect the provider to my car radio, the stereo at work, or my headphones, and carry my innovative music around with me. The sound is clear and translates well onto larger speakers, meaning I can enjoy it on my commute or my morning exercise regimen without having to accept diminished quality. Getting this for my phone has been a real blessing, one I intend to continue enjoying.",pandora
11/16/2016,"Many websites, including Pandora, are blocked by my work computer, but with my Kindle I can access Pandora via wi-fi and listen to my favorite music. Great for listening to Christmas music in my office!",pandora
12/29/2012,"Marketing an account is just stupid. I'm not saying the app is stupid, but I don't want to make an account just for music. Five stars if this feature wasn't there.",pandora
12/14/2012,Marvelous selection of music for every music taste. We find a lot of composers and albums we did not know about and have purchased some of their music. Can be switched from one music type to another easily.,pandora
5/15/2015,May be is a Good app but has country restriction and does not work in Venezuela,pandora
1/8/2016,May have commercials but they are very short. I sync my phone to car and listen to Pandora through Bluetooth.,pandora
11/7/2014,Maybe I am just too old to appreciate it? It will take some getting used to I guess.,pandora
2/18/2014,"Maybe I'm a little basis since this is the first internet radio I have used. I have tried the others and always return to Pandora. The app is very easy to use and well polished. You can even continue to enjoy the music after leaving the app.
 
 Pandora now had an alarm that can wake you by playing your favorite stations. If you never tried Pandora before I definitely suggest you give it a try.",pandora
11/15/2014,"Maybe I'm being too generous. I've had no experience with this app on other platforms, so I can't make comparisons. I just know iWork's as advertised, much better clarity than normal radio, and less commercials. I think the options for creating your own stations are great, and I've been introduced to new music that fits my selected genre that I never would have found on my own.",pandora
3/14/2014,"Maybe it is just the kindles we have? But it is a little buggy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. That said we are big Pandora fans and we use Pandora on all our devices. Just wish it worked better on the kindles",pandora

1/13/2015,"Meh. I'm tired of clicking thumbs down on the music of Kenny Baker and Joe Venuti, which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly, I suppose because they have some kind of deal with them. What about the deal with me, a paying customer? Won't renew. Incidentally, these are just examples, not isolated cases. On stations with older music, their variety is quite limited--baroque, for example, or several of their classical stations, probably because they're focused on a young audience.",pandora
1/18/2017,"Meh.
 Enormous ads, tiny controls, invasive permissions, hey, it's everything that's wrong with the internet all in one app.

It skipped and within half and hour I heard the song AGAIN. If you thumb down a song its supposed to never show back up. Also, it seems that there is a limited amount of thumbed up songs you can have. My biggest complaint is that the app signed me up for the free trial of Pandora One without my permission. I wasnt going to use the free trial until commercials and all the things Pandora One gets rid of really started to annoy me. This app is slow on my phone (Motorola Defy) and drain my battery on it and my kindle fire.

 Their may be other apps out there that are similar to Pandora and maybe better but my wife and I aren't lookaying.
 We are permanent Pandora listeners. It also works well with our TV's through Rokayu and Smart TV's.

 I just wish I could pay as I go instead of the ridiculously low price of (I think only) of $99.00/year...
 But I live on my retirement SSI and $100.00 all at once is more than I can handle... So I feel slightly guilty listening... just slightly even though the commercial breaks are to my taste better than the usual ones... No Fund Drives either unlike the ""Commercial"" Stations or Public Radio that always hit between SSI checks
 Great feature would be a senior account, However
 i can see no way to void the inevitable fraud that is going to appear... Perhaps a select few stations, Classical and perhaps easy listening...

Most of the time it chooses well, but if it doesn't I can unlike that track and the program learns better what I do like.

6/20/2016,No commercials just music tailored to your own tastes. It also provides tracks that are similar to your own favorites. The yearly license is worth the small investment. XM radio and Sirius cannot compete with this. The only drawback if there is one is that they have a time limit where if you don't rate/skip a track or whatever it will go into a play pause mode until you tell them you are still listening. A small price to pay.,pandora

4/21/2014,"no longer do I wish to waste my time with this ixmpecible app. as a music app critic, I have heard and used every app for music known. in all of my career this has been one of the most repolsive. no sound ever ame even with the volume on Max. I was declined of severally stations and the same song plays every ten minutes. if u r lookaying for an app worth the time, continue ur search by pressing back and scrolling to other options",pandora

8/13/2014,No problems so far. Thank you.,pandora
11/21/2016,no reason to pay for a subscription to Sirius or XM since this can be used through bluetooth in your car or plug your phone into your stereo. There are so many different stations just make up what you want to hear,pandora

11/17/2015,Nope,pandora
12/19/2013,"Not a bad app, very easy to use and install. I find it allows me to jump from Classic Rock to Top 40 depending on my mood. This was recommended by my daughter, so I was skeptical. Guess what? It's working well with my kindle and Blue tooth headset.",pandora
11/5/2015,"Not a bad free music app. You can select albums, artists etc to listen to. Shuffle all of them or choice just tone to play. You have no control over specific songs though. Also they throw 'similar music' onto the station you are listening too. Sometimes it is great, others can be disappointing. However if you want only the one album of specific song this does not work so well. If you do not like wha tis playing, you are limited to how many songs you can skip. And there are a fair share of ad interruptions. The other downside is that it takes a bit ti shut down the app and are constantly sending update notifications and thus far I have not figured out a way to stop them.
 But regardless, this is free and can still be great. I use this on my phone and kindle so that when I am cleaning, exercising or outside I can enjoy my favorite music and overall there are less interruptions here than on a live radio station. They have a good variety of music on it but seem limited to US artists so far mostly.",pandora
7/23/2014,not a fan of all the posting of adds,pandora
11/3/2014,"Not a fan. It played for about an hour then stopped and just kept asking if I wanted to upgrade for $4.99/more. I could not get the message to go away. Every time I tried to open the app, I got the upgrade message and could not get Pandora to play. I deleted the app.",pandora

1/8/2014,Not bad at all,pandora
5/1/2016,"Not bad but I prefer Spotify. The main issue with Pandora is that if you are trying to listen to music of a certain genre, it keeps playing old stuff, like 5-6 and more years old stuff. If you just want music like a certain artist you might be luckier.",pandora
7/9/2015,Not bad for a radio app. Plays music I haven't heard in years. it's not Spotify but since I can't get it on my tablet Pandora will do. The one thing I dislike is I can only skip 6 time in any given hour so I just change thru my song list to switch songs.,pandora
11/23/2015,"Not bad for free app. Not really a fan of the adds, but understand. The music mix is a good variety based on what you type in.",pandora
11/13/2012,Not bad good so to have for long car rides but personally i use the Google play version now,pandora

12/27/2014,Not bad!,pandora
1/22/2015,Not bad.,pandora

12/30/2013,"Not much to say, I think everyone knows about Pandora by now. I love it on those increasingly rare occasions when I want to listen to music, the variety is great, and I hear songs I had forgotten about. I am in my 50's so I lean to what is now called classic rock, never thought AC/DC and bands like them would be classic, but times change.",pandora
8/4/2016,Not much to say. Its a music service. That gives me exactly what I want to hear and listens to me when i tell it I don't like something and would rather not hear it again.

11/23/2011,Not only is this app great you get to listen to your favorite songs with that said you have to create a channel your favorite song is on but you can listen to music while your playing games searching the web basically everything you get on you can still be listening to music check as I Wright this review I'm listening to music this app deserves a true five stars from every body,pandora
3/3/2016,"Not real pleased in January as it is still playing Christmas music. I am able to receive this on my computer, my Droid and my Kindle which is prodigious. Remember you can only skip forward 6 songs per hour. It allows you to like or dislike a song",pandora

9/2/2014,"Not sure how to Close app on my Kindle (no 'x' top right to close). Other issues (delay, long silent pauses) may be due to my device, or cable connectivity (10GB), not the app, but I'm unclear.

9/12/2016,"Not sure if the permissions changed with the latest update or if I just never noticed, but why does Pandora need access to my personal info and the ability to send emails without knowledge?
 And not liking the whole ""play two songs then an ad or two"" set up. Not even the radio does that.
 I'm thinking it's time to go back to an MP3 player and download my music. No ads, no permissions, just me and the tunes...",pandora
1/11/2013,"Not sure what has happened to Pandora, but the annoying way the ads are, and the amount, are terrible. I used to be jealous of all the people at work with Pandora when all I had was Slacker on my Windows phone. I now have the Droid Razr Maxx HD and have Pandora, Slacker, and Iheart Radio. I have to say I am not jealous anymore. This is how I would rank the three apps I have listed: 1. Slacker 2. Iheart Radio 3.

7/26/2012,Not that great at all,pandora
12/28/2012,Not the best app ive seen but its better hen other radio apps. The reason I'm giving it three stars instead of five is because it picks songs that are picked by other people that like your song and that's why its amazing but if you don't like the song you can either skip it or dislike it that's not bad but you have limited skips and everytime you dislike a song it skips it every hour of listening you gain some skips. And also you HAVE to have Internet to use this app.,pandora
11/4/2014,Not the best butt pretty good,pandora
4/14/2013,not the best sound. too many commercials,pandora
12/27/2016,"Not the greatest. Sometimes it plays songs that have nothing to do with any of the songs/artists that I have ""thumbed up"". In fact, it does that a lot. The one thing that I like about it is I can have it playing in the background when I am using other apps on my Kindle.",pandora

10/15/2017,Not what I expected at all. Might as well go back to a boom box.,pandora
8/2/2014,Not what I expected. I heard a lot of people talking about this app but I was not impressed. I used it for one week and haven't accessed it since. I wanted it to pick music for me. Not me telling it what to play.,pandora

6/18/2016,Nothing beats Pandora. I strongly recommend.,pandora
1/29/2014,"Nothing better than this app for music! I don't mind the commercials every couple of songs except for when I'm using it in the middle of the night for my year old baby boy, playing the soothing sounds and then REALLY LOUD commercials jerk him awake. I just put it on really low volume now but then he doesn't really get the full effect. I love when they offer the free hour of no commercials and get so excited when it happens at night. Other than that, I use it daily and even have profiles for my five year old girl that has her kid stations on it that she made, which is a fab feature that our entire family loves! Will be paying soon to take commercials off, but only to help with little ones music. If that wasn't the case, I would have no problem at all with not paying. So don't delay! Download today! Enjoy music for your entire family at your fingertips! It's easy to use as well and keeps all your favorites =)",pandora

4/20/2015,"Now Listen,
 Spotify is better because you can pick what songs you want to here! on pandora ypu have to wait until you find a song you like,Trust me spotify is better because when you get the game you can get a 7 day trial that lets you listen to your songs where ever you want (Without WiFi) and it gives you better quality and NO ADS (Even know there is not a lot of ads and it only has ads about GOOD songs) and Pandora gives you an ad after every song! And you can get spotify Premium but its like 10/20 dollars every Month witch is not that bad...But dont worry spotify is already good!And on spotify you can change the quality in your settings.Oh yeah i forgot to tell you on spotify right after your trial runs out you might need to reset your profile because it well start to not let you listen to your music (Maybe) and i hate that ad on pandora about Jim Carlyles.com its so annoying,But anyways i don't recommend this App unless you want to hear an ad after every song!",pandora

 I song like it.",pandora
10/19/2014,okay for music,pandora
4/2/2012,"okay i'm 51 and never knew what Pandora was until my son who has an iphone showed it to me. Then found out I could get the app for free on my Kindle Fire. I love it. I think it is so neat how you make a album, type in a song or artist and it starts playing that song, then plays others song sort of like that one or even by same artist. And you click on thumbs up if you like it or thumbs down if you never want to hear that song again. It remembers. The only thing I wish was different is I wish that you could make a folder called MY FAVORITES and then drag all your songs that you absolutely love and want to hear over and over and over again into that folder. The way it is not you get to hear those you love, but others too and might not like everything playing. Sometimes I don't want to check out new songs in same catagory such as country, rap, techno etc. I just want to hear ONLY the ones I know the words to or that remind me of things.",pandora

2/19/2012,okay so I think this all is like sooooo awesome but what it realy needs is some bass / terb positions cause on some of these songs I am all like this would sound so cool with the bass up or the terb up so I think it would make an already cool app cooler,pandora
5/8/2012,okay the only problem I have is wen u type in an artist that means u only San'a hear them but they put other artist in the station but other than that its awesome and I love it,pandora
3/17/2014,okay this app is so amazing! u people that gave it any less than 5 stars are blind! this app is great for parties or u just want to jam!! yes the commercials are annoying sometimes but if u could just lookay past all that u would see the beautiful app that is Pandora!!!!! definitely a must-have app for all music lover's and definitely worthy of five stars!!,pandora
7/19/2012,okay to many commercials on free version,pandora
7/22/2012,okay!,pandora
7/30/2014,"okay, I absolutely love this app, I mean I don't have Pandora1 and I still love it, minimum ads, free music, AND comedian stations. There is just one suggestion I have, and I'm sure others will agree. All the time I accidentally hit the ""like"" or ""dislike"" button, and you can't undo it unless you change it to the other. My suggestion is that we are able to unclick the ""like"" and ""dislike"" button, but other than that it's great.",pandora
10/7/2015,"okay, when listening a specific station (say John Denver) sometimes songs sequence is not from the same type of music!",pandora

5/24/2016,"okayay people,it seems like EVERYONE is saying stuff like ""this app has to much ads"",or something like ""it isn't working"",but it works AWESOME on my kindle fire hd that I got on Christmas.in fact,I'm listening to it right now. I listen to it about everywhere. Usually I listen when I'm playing bad piggies,my little pony,or survival craft.Usually I also listen to Steadman5 radio.3 words for le app:this.is.epic. -derpy hooves",pandora
5/29/2013,okayay so I ordered Pandora from Amazon but why is it not in my apps ?? How am I suppose to possibly listen or get to it??,pandora
12/29/2012,"okayay so I was new to Pandora when I first got this app. I figured it put in about five minutes. the User interface is really easy to use. since they updated it a few days before I wrote this review it is on a serious incline. it has a ton of features from music variety to smoother connection, and in some cases higher quality sound. it is one of the best music apps around. don't listen to all the hatred because their reviews are outdated or they are biased. seriously. don't hesitate. its free and there is nothing unlimable about it. even the adds are bearable. and there are ways of skipping so gs you don't like without wasting skips. ;-)
 
 get it or regret it. I would buy it if it was five dollars. that's how good it is. AMAZINGNESSSSSSSS!",pandora
10/1/2013,okayay so when I open other apps while using Pandora when I go to skip it makes the screen go black then my Kindle tells me that it need to force close so press okayay and then it just reopens the app with out me telling it to.,pandora
12/4/2012,okayay so with this app u can listen to baslsically just about anything from country to pop nd hip hop,pandora
6/19/2013,"okayay this app is totally pimped out but I mean come on! This app does not play sensored music, so its not great for kids under 13. But the app itself is amazing and you can create your own station and listen to that genre. But there is also another problem, the advertisements are outta control! Who wants to listen to dating ads every other song???? It told me that I can upgrade to Pandora1 for 3.99 a month and I cant afford that. so just listen to this review!!!!!!!! FROBRO OUT!!!!!!!",pandora
4/12/2012,"okayay, I admit it, I am addicted to Pandora now. Before I got it I didn't understand what the hype was....Why not just listen to the radio? I love how I can tailor the station to the types of music I like and thumbs down the music and songs I don't like. There are also very few commercials, unlike with the radio where you can get 5 minutes worth of commercials at a time. When I get in the car I put on my seat belt, start the car, and set up Pandora through Bluetooth. It has become part of my driving routine. I also connect it to a stereo so I can listen while cleaning, doing yard work, or swimming in the pool.",pandora
3/10/2012,"okayay, so I wanted Pandora paid for a while, but discovered that it really wasn't worth $60 a year for me and discontinued. Imagine my dismay to find months later a charge feom Pandora. What's going on here?",pandora

Also, it can get a little repetitive. I hear a lot of accoustic, or live versions right after the original recording of a track. It would be nice to be able to skip more songs, and not have to pay to get rid of adds, but it is understandable, and could be worse with them. They aren't as easy to accidently hit as on some apps, but I did still pay to not have them. I think it was worth paying, so I am not interrupted by loud adds.

I had to hold the power button down for 20 seconds, let go, and hold it down for 3 more seconds (that is how I re-boot my Kindle). I deleted the app the second my Kindle powered back up.

8/3/2014,"ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW
 
 Current version still has a great selection and variety and almost no bugs. You have to register via email to use it now and It now has double the ads and they come in audio AND video form, usually in pairs or threes. Recently they removed the previously added time limit of a few hours a month. This means that, although you are still limited to a half dozen skips a day, you can at least listen to a station or change stations for as long as you want. This change made it regain a previously lost star and caused me to re-download it. They also added a feature to share the song on your registered pandora profile, facebookay, and twitter. You still won't get that perfect song in one go, but you won't run out of time waiting for it to queue up. It's still 3.99 for unlimited ad free music. I can't give it the full 5 stars because of the amount of Ads (I understand they have to do so to provide music for free, but they are going overboard) and the need to email register an account with them (sketchy stuff that often leads to notif and junk spamming), but it has definitely earned at least one more star for getting rid of that time limit. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys music and doesn't mind sitting through less favorite songs and ads to hear their top picks (like we used to do with the radio, before lime wire and kazaa)
 
 ORIGINAL REVIEW:
 It has a great selection and variety, almost no bugs, and tolerable ads. However, recently they added a time limit that is only a few hours a month! I could see an hour a day, but if you listen as often as I do, this means you can only use the app within the first few days of a month. First week, tops. This would make it acceptable for people who only listen for a song every now and then, but you still only get 6 skips an hour per station, so you won't get that perfect song in one go, and if you wait to hear it you'll run out of time for the month. Of course you can buy the 3.99 app and pay for unlimited ad free music or even pay .99 when your times up to keep listening for the month, but let's face it, this app was used too much without enough revenue so they are gonna force us to pay or suffer. Meanwhile, I'll be finding a new app.",pandora
7/16/2014,"Originally, when I reviewed Pandora I gave it one star due to too many commercials. Since I've gotten my Echo I noticed that problem has greatly improved! Pandora listened and now the commercials are manageable.",pandora

11/6/2017,"Overall a nice way to play Pandora radio on your mobile device while doing other things like reading or browsing the web. This review is more for people that know and enjoy Pandora radio for the web already. If you already don't like Pandora for whatever reason, you're not going to like the app, obviously.
 
 Previously gave it 3 stars for lack of certain features like the ability to edit the Shuffle. Used to be a bummer to have to log into Pandora web just to change the ""QuickMix"" station list, especially considering that my preferred device for Pandora, my Kindle Fire, would just redirect to the app when I would try to use pandora.com on the silk browser. Recent updates have added this missing functionality and more nice features--which seemed to have made it hang up once in a while, but that got fixed too-- and the Pandora app is now everything I wanted from it, so it has earned two more stars! Way to go, it is about time!",pandora

3/21/2015,"Pandora allows you to listen to a variety of music (you name it!!!). It is great to listen to whole working or being occupied. It does not always play the songs you want even if you 'like' them. It only allows you six skips per hour and gives you a certain # of hours to listen for a month. Every month is renewed. If you use all of your ""Pandora minutes"", you have to pay extra to listen for the rest of the month. But it is a terrific and extremely useful app!)",pandora
6/24/2014,"Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down.""

4/14/2013,"Pandora and their patented Music Genome Project tech allows them to play new music to you based on your listening history.
 
 The recommendations are almost always perfect, allowing me to hear new music I never would have encountered without Pandora. I have purchased music from bands I would have never listened to, and 99pct of whose music I find awful. But Pandora can find that one song that said band stuck on sone album five years ago, and see based on the songs Musical Genome that I might enjoy it. And I almost always do!
 
 Pandora and its Music Genome Project are light years beyond any other music streaming sites algorithms based on genres, playlists or whatever. The music industry owes Pandora big time for keeping people like me buying music I never would have known was just my taste.",pandora
1/9/2017,Pandora app is awesome!! Can listen to any of your favorite music and it even has an alarm for your devices!,pandora
12/19/2015,Pandora app is much like the website and it does sync to your account. My only dislike is the new alarm clock function does not work on the kindle Hd. It will not start playing until you open your kindle so it will never actually wake you up.,pandora
3/27/2014,"Pandora App on Kindle Fire works like a charm!. Love the interface and Pandora's way of recommendations of music I listen to. I can see the Album Art and details about the artists. Streaming quality is pretty good.
 
 FYI - The pop-up Advertisements are there (Apart from regular Ads between songs randomly) as this is the 'free' version of the App and it bothers me at times as I cannot Skip tracks when Ads are present but I can live with that for now knowing that it is a free Application.
 
 I also like that you can let Pandora stream music in the background while I do other things on Kindle Fire. It is a nice way listen to music when you are connected to Wi-Fi.",pandora
1/14/2014,"Pandora app works as intended, however having a video add literally every 2-3 songs is a bit excessive. I loved how there was a programming bug at one point of time that caused AD interruptions, however seems like that has been since fixed. The only other thing I can think of is how it recommends like artists for your playlist. Very redundant on songs, little variety. Some recommendations are complete outside the genre that you are listening to. Songs that I have downvoted still play, it is a very brokayen system. If Grooveshark wouldn't have been shut down, I would definitely not be using Pandora. Needs improvement for sure.",pandora

""Peter Gabriel"" for instance will create a station of music by that artist and others Pandora deems similar such as Pink Floyd and Sting. This can be a good way to discover music you like but might not have heard yet. It is well worth paying the upcharge for Premium service to get rid of the commercials.",pandora
10/22/2016,Pandora definitely has much more variety than your average radio station. All I listen to is Pandora now but I come across the same songs all the time. It seems as though they play only the popular songs or have no k n owing of any different miles you have been listening for hours.

 It has a sleep timer from 15 min. up to an hour, which is great when you like falling to sleep with music without wearing down the battery on your device.
 I've found that there are fewer and shorter ads on the mobile app than the website online.
 One place for improvement; simplify the ability to use the alarm clock feature. I can't seem to get it to turn on without having to unlock the kindle first, which defeats the purpose of an alarm clock if you have to be awake for it to go off...

I wish there were a way to change that, though, and if there is I've not found it. The ads are obnoxious, though - not only do you have to listen to them but they pop up in app and are very easy to inadvertently trigger. Really guys? Can't just pick one way for ad delivery? Also kind've lame considering you, Pandora, do not pay a lot of the artists for the media usage rights, but we'll just see how the court case pans out on that one.

But I am saddened by the fact that if my kindle screen goes idle the music consistently skips unlike when the screen is active where it might skip once in an hour.

3/20/2014,"Pandora has been around a long time so by now everyone pretty much knows what they're getting. I have been using the free version for about two years now, listening to the endless cycling of the same commercials every 2-3 songs - but hey it's free so I can't dispute it otherwise. The commercials are relatively short but it wouldn't hurt to mix them up every once in a while rather than force the listener to hear to the same Home Depot bit a dozen times within the span of two hours. I have yet to purchase Pandora One (paid version), but the thought has crossed my mind since it's only a measly $3 per month ($36/year). This version eliminates all commercials.
 
 Pros:
 -free
 -offers different stations from an array of artists where alike music is mixed in
 -there is enough variety if you like to frequently switch stations
 -easily syncs with your phone allowing for a skip or pause button
 -they have a decent rating system where it plays to your likes and dislikes
 -if you get tired of a song then there are options to shelf it for a while
 
 Cons:
 -commercials are repetitive and seems to have become more frequent than what they were two years ago when I first downloaded
 -not enough variety of songs if you keep it on one station, you hear the same tracks if you're a daily listener
 -rating system tends to overcompensate to your like and dislikes (e.g. if you give a thumbs up to say a country song that you're listening to, then they will force feed you with country songs thinking that's all you want to hear), but the more you rate the better it fixes itself
 
 Overall Recommendation:
 If commercials bother you then one can eliminate commercials by subscribing at a monthly cost less than what it takes to put a gallon of gas in your car. I would definitely pay the $3 if there was a guarantee for better variety, but until then I'm satisfied with the free version and who knows, maybe that's why I'm shopping at Home Depot more as of late...",pandora
1/4/2014,Pandora has been around for a while and most people know how well it works. I use it every morning to listen to music while riding my motorcycle to work. Picking a favorite channel is a breeze and I usually don't have to skip songs I don't like.,pandora

If you use the free version (as I have done since Pandora came out as an app) then prepare for at least 2 commercials every couple songs.

8/9/2013,"PANDORA is a cool, trendy station that I enjoy very much. Pandora plays in our home on a daily basis. Fantastic.",pandora
10/26/2012,"Pandora is a creative and entertaining way to receive music from your favourite artists. You type In an artist and Pandora will play songs and artists that are similar to the artists genre. While you listen to music you may go online or play games at the same time. Pandora allows you to skip a limited amount of tracks. You can only skip about 5 songs on that station. Although you may skip about five more tracks again after an hour. There is also ads between songs, but probably after every 5 or more songs. You can pay with an ad-free experience with Pandora for around $6.00. Another thing I like about Pandora is that if you see a song you like it will ask you if you want to buy it on iTunes or bookaymark it. On Pandora you cannot replay a track or rewind it. I enjoy my experience with pandora and I think it is worth buying.",pandora
2/27/2016,Pandora is a dream. I listen to music from the 80s.,pandora
1/30/2013,Pandora is a fabulous way to listen to whatever type of music suits your mood for the moment. Much variety. 4 stars because it will ask often enough if you are still listening and you need to answer it or the music stops playing- that gets old.,pandora

9/14/2013,"Pandora is a good value for money with one major problem. After you listen for a while it pauses, and then asks do you want to continue.

2/11/2017,Pandora is a great app for music play. Upside is that you can create any list you want .... down side is that there is not enough different music added to your selected playlist type.,pandora
7/20/2014,"Pandora is a great app if you like to play music based on your mood or your environment. You can create multiple 'stations' that play what you want to hear by selecting a few artists or songs that you like, then the app will choose other songs that fit that style. They have spent a tremendous amount of time categorizing and analyzing every song that plays, noting the rhythm, chord structure, key, tempo, harmonics, instrumentation, etc. By analyzing the songs you pick, it can then go to its library and find songs that match similar features.
 
 I don't believe it will play every song on a given album/CD though. There must be certain tracks that the record label allows them to play. To hear the rest, you have to buy the album of course. ;-)",pandora
11/10/2015,Pandora is a great app it lets me pick the station I want to listen to and has great music but the only down side I see to this is that you need WiFi access but if it didn't needed WiFi it would be a good seller over all this is a great app : ),pandora

12/27/2012,Pandora is a great concept lookays easy to use. It downloads and opens quickly on my Nokayia phone . But then Pandora does not work. I get the Pandora logo with a message stating it is having trouble playing my next selection. The low rating is more for the lack of diagnostics than the app itself.

7/13/2017,"Pandora is a great music player that allows you to play a variety music by genre, artist and even theme. The functionality and ease of use are top notch. The only knock I have against it are the very intrusive audio ads. These ads are the only deterrent to me listening more. Even the pesky pop up ads are more bearable than the intrusive audio interruptions.",pandora
5/27/2015,"Pandora is a great music player. I like the selection of music they play for me in the four or five genres I play the most. There are a few advertisements per hour in the free version and that's tolerable.
 I gave them only three stars because the new user interface is absolutely horrible. Pandora must have been compelled to make things move and make information disappear from view until you direct the cursor over the pictures to make the information visible again. Why? The old interface was simple, clear and functional. Some inexperienced kid out of college must have needed a job and Pandora hired the kid to make the GUI as hard to use as possible. But, the music is good. They don't make it, just play it.",pandora

As you listen, Pandora lets you rate songs by giving a thumbs up or down, or skip tracks altogether. This helps it figure out your likes and dislikes to create a playlist perfectly unique to you. It's important to be an active listener for the algorithm to do its job. Recently, the app added a great new feature, alarm clock.

 The commercials don't bother me at all. So far there've only been decent ads (regular TV spots) and I think that this is one of the electronic products that you can ""opt out"" of the ad after so many seconds into the ad. Some of the ads are good (that is, interesting, at least to me).

5/21/2016,"Pandora is an excellent music app. I would recommend Pandora One, for only $3.99 a month, it's commercial free. I think you get extra skips per day as well.
 
 Pandora is a great way to find new music similar to artist or songs you like. It's great for parties and gatherings. This app doesn't use much of your data either which is surprising. YouTube drains data but Pandora doesn't.",pandora

2/19/2013,Pandora is an nice stations,pandora
7/20/2012,"Pandora is an okay service, but the ability to ""create a station"" is quite overblown. When one creates a station with a (very) popular performer, that performer should be 50-70% (at least) of the songs played. I often find that percentage down around 10-20%. While I like being introduced to new artists that I might not have heard before, making them the most played is not what I am lookaying for.
 
 I can go to YouTube and get all the songs I want from any artist I want.
 
 That's the main reason I don't upgrade; it's not quite what I'm lookaying for. Comments welcome and info about upgrade features would be interesting.",pandora
10/17/2017,"Pandora is apparently not for seniors as it does not have easy readable words to navigate through it. I have now struggled with the new set up.

12/10/2014,Pandora is great for finding music similar to what I like. I use it on my PC all the time. I don't use it on my phone much since it uses the cell data plan when not on Wifi.

4/7/2013,"Pandora is great until I search a Relaxing & Sleep sounds and upon falling asleep, I was startled by an Advertisement announcement. Well it tookay another hour to fall back asleep. I found that to be Add Free, Pandora will accept a MONTHLY FEE of $4.55 not a small one time FEE. So no more sleep sounds.

6/17/2016,"Pandora is great. Sure I could do without the ads, but for free it gives great music and so many station choices.",pandora
3/17/2013,Pandora is great. The Alexa Pandora integration is a little more strict than it is with other products. Commands have to be exact with no variance or it will not understand. Just fine if you are lookaying for random stations but too picky at getting to your own.,pandora
3/24/2013,"Pandora is great. The only disappointed is that my Kindle does not have its own WiFi so you cannot listen to it out of WiFi range such as a beach, etc",pandora
6/22/2017,Pandora is great. You are in complete control of what you hear without the cost. And once it learns what your tastes are it does a wonderful job of predicting what you will want to hear. Praise for Pandora!,pandora
4/13/2015,Pandora is great. You can listen to already established stations and build your own station with all you favorite music.,pandora
1/29/2014,"Pandora is groovy. I set the tone and Pandora grooves me. Yeahhhhhhh. It could be better if it included dancing girls, but then all I have to do is close my eyes.",pandora
1/5/2015,"Pandora is grvat provided that you don't mind listenimg to attost otheer than the artost of youe choice most pd the time. I find it very frustrating. I recemtly added an srtist a,d lustened to WELL OVer100 songs on thi s station but SYILL have not heard even 1song by this artist. Thats just ridiculous.",pandora
12/30/2013,"Pandora is hands down the best source of any music you like to listen and enjoy. I had satellite radio for over 10 years when XM started up, then I found pandora and never lookayed back. It really needs 10 stars!.",pandora
4/16/2014,"Pandora is hands down the greatest streaming music app ever. The new updates make it even more user friendly. Would upgrade to ad free, but $4 a month is a little steep for the few hours I listen.",pandora
6/26/2016,"Pandora is honestly really great. I've literally been using it for a solid 6 months straight, it's that good. And I don't get these reviews saying that commercials interrupt the songs, cuz they don't. You'll get like one commercial every 3 or 4 songs with little pop up ads. while listening. And since my kindle's on lock most of the time when I'm listening, or since I'm doing other things like playing games or on the web, it doesn't matter cuz I cant see the ads. I like this app a whole lot, and ill probably be a loyal fan for years.",pandora
12/24/2012,Pandora is horrible!! Its slow!! It laggggs really bad. I wanted to purchase Pandora 1 but its not worth the $4 a month to listen to silence!!,pandora
9/9/2012,Pandora is how I listen to most of my music. It has a huge verity of music and artists. It does a good job of guessing what other music I like and gives me 100 different artists or playlists at a time in my library to chose from. Plus it still gives me the option to skip or dismiss a song if I don't like it.,pandora
12/10/2013,"Pandora is ideal for my Kindle Fire. I can play music wherever I go, whenever i want. And Pandora knows what I like.",pandora
2/2/2016,"Pandora is imho the best music streaming app in the known universe. I use it at home, work and sometimes in my car. I love how it learns the music you like to listen to and suggests new music in the same genre. Give it a try, I think you'll like it.",pandora

11/8/2014,"Pandora is just great! I like music to be playing when I'm working,and Pandora is not the easiest to get going quick, but they also play songs by the artists I select that I don't even have in my extensive collection. I like the fact that you can select artists and they create a whole station around them and artists that are similar. Their picks for extra artists are generally very good--many artists I like are already included with others I've chosen. The few short commercials are hardly a bother, and they play long cuts uninterrupted.",pandora
12/27/2016,Pandora is just music. You get to choose you're own topic radios that are related to the topic radio you chose.,pandora
4/8/2015,"Pandora is just okay, not wonderful.",pandora

12/20/2013,Pandora is just the right mix of music you can program for yourself. It's nice to set the prameters and let the app keep you moving to the music.,pandora
6/2/2014,Pandora is kind of confusing because when i want to listen to music it doesn't let me. I like it because it is simple to play music with just a click of a button.,pandora

10/29/2015,"Pandora is like radio my way. Almost as good as an ipod. I wonder why they chose this name, you know with that box and everything that came with it. That name should have been saved for something bad.",pandora
5/5/2013,"Pandora is like the best thing ever in my life. If I don't have Pandora on my day will not go well. I wake up to Pandora and fall asleep listening to Pandora. To be able to listen to whatever station, and to ??your favorite songs is awesome. #TeamPandora",pandora
12/19/2013,Pandora is like the most popular radio station in the whole world and it has all of my favorite songs on the app but the only thing I don't like about Pandora is that you can't skip how many songs you want there's a limit.,pandora
11/13/2015,"Pandora is marvelous way to listen to your favorite music. Besides, you can selected from varieties of singers or Artists.",pandora

2/12/2013,"Pandora is my favorite of the many music sites and apps available.
 The combination of music artists that the program provides opens your musical experience and introduces you to new artists that you may not know about already.",pandora
3/11/2015,"Pandora is my first streaming music experience. The more I use it, the more I dislike it. Its song library is extremely limited compared to other providers. There is very little variety and you hear the same songs over and over if you pick two stations with similar genres. Buy Pandora One and you still CANNOT skip an unlimited number of songs. This is total crap. Whats premium if you can control the content. Don't subscribe and you have to listen to lame ads where people repeat their phone number over and over and over. Keeping the app as a back up, but moving on to something with a larger library, less repetition and more robust features.",pandora
2/3/2013,Pandora is my go to for music when on road trips or working out. Pandora One is well worth the price for ad free and interruption free music.,pandora

1/8/2017,"Pandora is no longer is free, you get a limited time to listen to music each month unless you buy the whole version or pay .99 a month. Even though that's inexpensive why pay to listen to the radio? Download iheartradio, it's the same exact thing legit but completely free.",pandora
11/22/2013,pandora is not a good product when compared to Rdio as Rdio not only lets you play stations but let you pick individual songs and listen to playlists and publisher playlists and there's a Rokayu station Android iTunes everything just a great product. I used Pandora for a while but I was so sick of the repetitiveness in the poor music selection that I have given up on them forever,pandora
4/17/2013,Pandora is not my favorite,pandora
11/21/2014,Pandora is now my go to source for music. I have selected a few of my favorite artist and use the shuffle option. The like/dislike option helps to eliminate selections that aren't exactly what I want to hear. Terrific!,pandora

3/1/2015,Pandora is one of the things in my life that never disappoints. I have had no problem with reception on my devices. With it's astounding variety of music the only limitations are on me for lack of creativity in my selections. In a lull at a recent party of mine someone talked about skating to a song and before you knew it we created a play list of the song and everyone was rocking and telling stories for the rest of the night.,pandora
7/26/2016,"Pandora is one the apps I use daily, and I absolutely adore it. There is a big problem with Pandora ever since the new update came. Pandora will now play 2 or 3 songs and then freeze up and stall. I'm not liking that at all. This problem needs to be fixed.",pandora
9/14/2013,"Pandora is overall a great listening station. I mean, you can't get any better than free. Even better, every device linked with one account will share the same stations. If I had one thing to say, it's the ads. About 2 of them come on every 2-3 songs. And considering the fact that the same ads play all the time, it can get quite irritating. Great app though. :)",pandora

I am a child of the 70's so my Eagles Radio gives me all the classic rock I could ever want. The pre-programmed stations are great too. Gotta love a little disco from time to time on 70's radio. And sometimes I even like a little country. Listen at home on the internet, on your smart phone, tablet.. and of course Kindle. Wifi or 3 or 4 G. Make your own station based on any of your favorite bands. The more music you ""like"" the more customized it becomes. thumbs down and you never hear it again.",pandora
3/14/2016,Pandora is the best app we have. I can stream my favorite artists and group them other artists of a similar nature.

8/20/2014,Pandora is the best music app out there. Easy to understand and plays great songs. The one bad part is they limit ur free listening to 40 hours a month.

 If you are lookaying for a great music app that has variety and every song you could imagine - even from artists that aren't very well known.
 .
 .
 .
 .
 Just to put it out there,
 All you need to use pandora is an email.
 .
 .
 .
 .
  The only bad thing I have found about pandora is that adds are fairly frequent.
 To remove ads you have to upgrade to pandora one, which has a monthly fee.
 
 I have never had pandora crash on me and no glitches.
 .

2/5/2015,"Pandora is the best. Years ago when I first got it for my phone, I had a tedious desk job where the only thing you did all day was do the same repetitive data entry task, and so we were allowed to wear headphones. I paid the $4 a month (at the time that was the price - I'm not sure if that's changed) to take away the ads, and man was it worth it. Best $4 a month I'd ever spent. Listening to music at this job was one of the only things there that kept me sane.",pandora

 3. extremely expensive for what you get - spend the $36 a year on 36 single downloads and you'll have more variety and better quality.

8/2/2017,"Pandora saved me a bunch of money. I wanted to buy Sattelite radio, but my girlfriend wouldn't let me. So I went the Pandora route. Seems good to me. I still want sattelite radio.... but it can wait.",pandora
12/28/2012,Pandora saves lives! I listen to Pandora religiously. It adds different music to the station based on things you indicate that you like. It sometimes repeats songs maybe an hour or two after listening to the station but it doesn't happen frequently. I wouldn't know what I would do without this app!,pandora
7/31/2013,"Pandora searches not only for that particular artist/ music you seek, finding this and similar. Often the reward is music new to you and or some you've forgotten.",pandora
12/19/2015,"Pandora seems fine as long as your taste in music runs to current and popular works. If you want something more eclectic, not so hot. Or perhaps they're targeting people under 40, with only lip service to older demographics. The diversity of content of people who want music that was popular prior to 1980 is fairly sparse, and basically lumped together based on the year rather than format. There's just no other explanation for putting Jerry Lee Louis and Dean Martin on the same play list supposedly geared to 1950s rock n roll. Of course, you can ""skip"" the Dean Martin song, but if you also skip the Frank Sinatra and Perry Como songs that immediately follow, you exceed your ""skip"" quotient with the ""free"" version. Basically, even with contemporary music, I find their alogrithms in need of either code writers with a better understanding of the various music genres or much tighter parameters. I have seen very little improvement in this during the past 5 years with ""stations"" I try to construct, so it gets longer and longer between the times I actually use Pandora. Do have to say that their ""Rockin Holidays Radio"" station pretty much delivered on its promise, so there is someone in programming that ""gets it."" Hopefully that person will have a larger role in the overall experience going forward.",pandora
2/23/2015,"Pandora seems like a nice radio station website, operable and clean. Thing is, it tends to assume about the music you enjoy and I'd say it's a 50/50 shot it'll be right. Can sometimes be annoying.",pandora
1/1/2015,"Pandora seems really good, but I have only just started to listen to it.",pandora
5/27/2014,"Pandora seems to have become the defacto standard for streaming music. Available on just about every platform, seems to be trouble free.",pandora
12/31/2014,"Pandora seems to learn my preferences so quickly. By giving thumbs up/down feedback it was able to create a perfect station pretty quickly that encompassed my favorites across several genres.
 
 I use pandora really frequently, so it was worth it to go premium and avoid the ads, but even before I did, the ads were not too annoying. Unlimited skips with premium is also a nice upgrade.",pandora
8/5/2013,"Pandora seems to work just fine on my new Kindle Fire HD. It's like having an unlimited library of music at my finger tips, and I get to decide on what music I get to hear. Who could ask for more?",pandora
9/20/2016,"Pandora should be able to simply list albums and/or songs by an artist - not simply try to make suggestions based on entered information. If I want to populate a ""station"" only with songs of a particular artist, I should be able to do so....",pandora
8/18/2013,Pandora should be like face bookay but it has music,pandora
11/6/2013,"Pandora simply ROCKS, you can listen to music on it, and create your own stations, give thumbs up or thumbs down to songs, and much, much more. I pay a dollar only a month for it, but I could pay $4 for Pandora one a month, it allows you to skip as many tracks as you want, and doesn't have any advertisements popping up like regular pandora I prefer. YOU GET IT, then decide after the free trial if you are to upgrade it, leave it the way it is, or stop using it. Your choice.",pandora
2/14/2015,"Pandora skipped a little while playing a few songs, but I will still recommend this to my friends and family.",pandora
9/8/2013,Pandora sometimes wont stop playing when I go to bed. so annoying:/ it sometimes doesn't d oit but I had to redown load it for it to turn off. last chance pandora,pandora
1/4/2014,pandora speaks for itself in quality and has vast stations. on the flip side it uses a lot of resources and i have to constantly kill it,pandora
12/13/2012,Pandora started out great but then it started crashing almost every time I used it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,pandora
11/7/2011,Pandora stays on for approximately 5mins . Device has to be turned off and on again and the same thing happens,pandora
12/30/2013,Pandora stoped working for me today and I tried redownloading and it still wont work,pandora
3/28/2016,"Pandora stops me from having to make up a lot of play list, but the catorgies they have and the music in them are not always what I expect.",pandora
7/7/2016,Pandora streaming is off-line and I have become a Slacker fan...Pandora streaming to multiple AV receivers has stopped for the past +30-days and Pandora is very slow to resolve this issue like past ones. Not able to listen to Pandora on such receivers so I now found Slacker Radio and use it via the iPod connection. Music selection with minimal 30-second commercials is free and finding better music selection/rotation than my paid Pandora music subscription. I have become a Slacker and goodbye to Pandora!,pandora
6/21/2013,"Pandora streams almost flawless. Its easy to find a station for you, by artist or song.",pandora
7/16/2016,Pandora streams great.,pandora
7/9/2015,"Pandora streams music with clear, quality sound. The availability of stations is awesome. Purchased the low cost of no advertisement Pandora and go everywhere with it on all of my devices. Thank you Pandora and keep up the great work.",pandora
5/4/2015,"Pandora sucks! They say it is FREE, but you only get 40 hours free, after that you have to pay 99 cents till the end of the month, when they reset it, or pay $3.99 a month for pandora one, which is commercial free.",pandora
3/25/2014,"Pandora sucks. Set up a ""station"" based on one of my favorite bands and played for two hours without actually playing a song by that band. Pandora also keeps trying to play music by bands I can't stand (guns and roses, ac-dc) because they are in the same genre as other music i like even though they are talentless.",pandora
4/4/2013,Pandora tells me they are not avaliable ast this time.,pandora
8/10/2017,Pandora timed out and I can not get back up and running.any suggestions.,pandora
9/30/2017,Pandora tried to take over my phone.Every time I got out of an app. Pandora came on.I like Pandora but I will choose when to play it.,pandora
7/29/2016,"Pandora tries to guess why I like a song and send me other songs it thinks are similar. It is wrong--a lot. This would be okayay if I could quickly tell it to move on, but, at least on my phone, the buttons are fairly unresponsive.",pandora
4/29/2016,"Pandora used to be awesome. played it all the time on my phone. Now it seems to freeze all the time, or pause and when I try to hit play it plays for one second then freezes again. Waaaay more commercials now too...",pandora
11/15/2011,"Pandora used to be good, until they added strict limits on how many songs you could skip during the whole day and shoved a commercial down your throat every other song. There's way better options out there.",pandora
11/11/2011,Pandora used to be great on my kindle fire until a few days ago it turned on fine but wouldent play music at all it gave me the option to play pause and like and dislike but it wouldn't play anything plz fix because you lost me as a customer,pandora
9/5/2016,"Pandora used to be really good, but lately, they have been making all these new rules and guidelines. It works well but it's hard to enjoy it because of these new rules. I do NOT recommend this to anyone!",pandora
9/3/2013,"Pandora used to have a nice interface. Now it spams you with alarm notifications and ads that must be manually closed. You have to go through 3 screens just to close the program. It doesn't support the menu button. It turns on and off randomly, so you can't let it idle in the background. Perfect, now after I have been bluetooth streaming in the car, leave the car and let the app shut itself down, it will wake up on a whim at a random time and blare music. When I'm in a meeting or library. Awesome.... Fix your app, Pandora. There is no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance. I know that I would never pay for premium these issues.",pandora
6/10/2013,"Pandora was a pain, so was using I Heart. Since the update, so much better. Easier to navigate, lists the lyrics, love the selection of stations and music. Created a station I love. But if you are lookaying for more eclectic artists and to discover new tunes, stick with I Heart. Also love if there's a song I hate,I never have to hear it again.",pandora
3/10/2015,"Pandora was all i listened to until i reconnected my iPod, it sometimes gets disruptive but over all its a very good app!",pandora
9/7/2012,"Pandora was always ahead of their time and a great service, the reason for 4 stars is the annoying ads if you don't opt for the pay version of the app.",pandora
6/19/2016,"Pandora WAS awesome and rated 5 stars, UNTIL the most recent update. Now it freezes up my Kindle Fire every few song and that makes it virtually unusable. It will remain a 1 star until they fix the 'improvements'.",pandora
11/9/2014,"Pandora was awesome on my Kindle Fire...until yesterday. Still plays great on my iPhone but sucks on Kindle!! Please fix, I beg you.",pandora
12/11/2012,Pandora was easy to put on my kindle. I am used to I Tunes. Have to get used to it.,pandora
8/7/2015,"Pandora was found when I was lookaying for a particular musician. Phil Keaggy to be specific. Paul McCartney identified Phil as the world's greatest classical guitarist a number of years ago, and the amazing thing about Keaggy is that he only has nine fingers! Anyway, I found Keaggy's music on Pandora and have been listening ever since!",pandora
4/22/2013,"Pandora was good at one point, now every other song leads to 3 commercials and disliking a song takes 5 minutes to load, the computer version is slightly better and is way last buggy",pandora
10/25/2014,"Pandora was my first, and I have tried a few but keep comming back to her..great app, easy to use, nice selection of tunes",pandora
5/25/2015,Pandora was okay when u were able 2 skip 6 times every hour but now they skimp u on skips and the lame comercials every othe song. I jst download my own music and not have 2 worry bout using it,pandora
5/14/2013,"Pandora was okayay at first but after the most recent update, its been playing two songs at the same time.",pandora
8/21/2013,"Pandora was once a great source of music, then began running slow or simply not running at all. I deleted it!",pandora
12/10/2012,Pandora was once a wonderful way to listen to music. Now between every couple of songs there's a huge pause. Not seconds long but minutes long. Then there's an ad. I don't mind ads but I do mind the minutes of silence. I get that they want you to upgrade and pay them but if the free version with ads is this poor then they should only offer the subscription.,pandora
4/17/2015,"Pandora was perfect in every way until I heard a Monsanto advertisement. I am completely against Monsanto (nothing good comes from that ugly company), I deleted Pandora. Highly disappointed. Booo.",pandora
11/18/2012,Pandora was put on my iPhone by my granddaughter and I was completely satisfied with the service they provide and all my music requests have been met without a hassle!,pandora
3/19/2015,Pandora was recommend by a lady at a time when another one I tried didn't work for me. Pandora gets my 5star vote.,pandora
1/1/2014,"Pandora was recommended to me by a friend, so I downloaded it to my Kindle fire. Quick and easy download as usual for the fire...very easy to start navigating around the app with no real instruction needed. I did not use the instructional ""get started"" guide that is provided. I quickly created some stations based on my many moods and am pleased to say that it has become my favorite source of music at work! I use the free version and do not find the ads to be too intrusive. Well worth the download!",pandora
10/11/2012,Pandora was the best thing I have gotten yet. I encourage everyone who knows about Pandora my music should purchase it,pandora
2/28/2014,"Pandora was the best thing until I had to start paying the monthly fee. It used to be that it was free with adds, but now after I updated it I cant listen to music anymore. total rip off",pandora
6/6/2013,"Pandora was the first human woman created by the deities, specifically by Hephaestus and Athena on the instructions of Zeus.",pandora
4/27/2013,"pandora was the greatest invention.. u can listen to any kind of music all for FREE, life is pandora :)",pandora
10/14/2013,Pandora why you so awesome?!?! This app has gotten me into some awesome bands. I'm always listening to it pretty much everywhere.,pandora

7/25/2012,Pandora will not except my email or let me register!!!,pandora
5/1/2016,"Pandora will not let me create an account. My birthday was not correct and I don't know how else I can do it so I just uninstalled this app. If you are lookaying for a good radio station app, then get I heart radio. I give I five stars.",pandora
12/5/2014,Pandora will not shut off when the phone rings and I am talking to someone else needs to be some type of disconnect when the phone rings Pandora or shut down temporarily,pandora
4/9/2012,"Pandora will play one day really well,then the next not so much. I have to keep hitting the internet connection..my computer works fine but sadly Pandora is the only thing that doesn't all the time.",pandora
1/25/2016,Pandora won't take my password what app does that???,pandora
1/11/2013,Pandora woo!!!,pandora
1/29/2016,"Pandora worked great until yesterday. None of my stations are available on my kindle fire HD. I had the same problem on my iPhone, but that is now fixed. When will it be fixed for the kindle?",pandora
2/20/2015,"Pandora worked out of the box, but I found the instructions to be unclear. Example, when I accidently bypassed the correct 'time' setting, it tookay me 2 days and hours of internet research to find how to reset. Seems to me there should be an instruction bookaylet with the unit. It is different that the computer I've used for years, and trying to use the on-line guide is a bit cumbersome. It does seem to work well when I can figure something out, however.",pandora
8/7/2015,Pandora works for me!,pandora
3/16/2014,Pandora works good ..,pandora
5/30/2016,"Pandora works great on everything except my new amazon fire tablets. I bought 2 tablets and neither have sound when running Pandora. It's the only program that does not work. Amazon fire only. Program runs, shows a song is playing, progression bar does not move, no sound on tablet. 1 star only for fire tablet. 5 stars on any other device.",pandora
7/10/2014,Pandora works great on my Kindle Fire,pandora
12/1/2015,Pandora works great on our devices. No issues at all.,pandora
9/14/2014,"Pandora works nicely on my new Kindle Fire. So why the 4 stars vs. a 5? Because, I am not sure it really deserves more than 4! In a week, I may find it very deficient in some unknown area, or in 6 months I may not be able to recall a time when I could get through the day without Pandora simulating my tastes in musics of all genres. The basic option cost me nothing, so maybe my lack of skin in the game tempers my enthusiasm or disdain. If it costs you nothing to try Pandora, I recommend that you get it and make your own assessment.",pandora
7/30/2017,Pandora works so nicely on my Kindle HD8.,pandora
3/14/2013,Pandora works the best for me. I just want to listen to the music. I upgraded so I don't hear commercials. I also don't care to hear the on air personalities. I create the station I want and the rest is taken care of.,pandora
10/22/2017,Pandora works well in my kindle fire but by the reviews of others I think it might not work as well in other devises.,pandora
12/18/2014,Pandora works well on my kindle 8.9 hd. The speakers are great. I have been a pandora fan for about 4 years now and while i noticed a rise in advertisements it still beats the radio by a long shot. Occasional glitches on opening the app but nothing serious,pandora
5/27/2012,Pandora would not accept me as a customer!,pandora
1/24/2013,Pandora would not let me register with them,pandora

12/26/2016,"Pandora
 There's room for Pandora. I have been a big fan of another music streaming app, but decided to give Pandora a try, and I'm glad I did. The interface is clean and very simple to use. The outstanding feature that sets Pandora apart is the ability to shuffle play multiple artists. I like my Sinatra right next to my Ramones right next to my John Williams, and this is a feature that requires a subscription on other music streaming apps. Like The Beatles? They're available on Pandora.",pandora
4/21/2015,"Pandora
 Too many advertisements and they come up where it is easy to accidentally click on the advertisements.
 Free is good, but not when they put advertisements where you can accidentally click on them.",pandora

Customize the station. buy the music. share the song with a link. the lyrics can even be lookayed at on some songs. don't like the song, thumbs down. or you can move the song to somewhere else. i like the commercials. i have the free pandora. any station, clean, explicit. doesn't matter and pandora tells you if you are listening to the clean version of any song.

So, if you want your battery ti be ruined, get it. Otherwise DONT.",pandora

1/29/2016,"Panodora is a really great app and plays po the music I want, but my advice to you would be not to ""like"" the songs you like, because it takes it seriously plays that song over and over again. I promise that if you listen to the song area times it will recognize that you like it and play it more frequently. It never plays the songs that you dislike ,though, and that's always a good thing:)",pandora

I've wasted countless hours with Pandora over the past few years on the PC, blackberry, iPad, iPod touch (3RD gen) HTC Evo, and Evo 3D.

 When going to sleep there is no sleep timer since the last update, it was removed for Android tablets. Please bring it back.

6/24/2016,"Put this on my Kindle and also my computer as I really enjoy listening to music. When you enter an artist, you get a mix of that artist along with similar artists. You can put in multiple artists and put the music on shuffle and it will go back and forth between artists/genres. Although not significant, I have found that the information/lyrics are sometimes incorrect. For example, I can't remember who they said wrote the song OHIO, but it was not the correct artist-it was written by Neil Young. Not generally a big deal or problem. I have opted to not pay the 3.99/mo to get Pandora commercial free as they are all less than 30 seconds and for me are not bothersome.",pandora

9/10/2015,Seems like they repeat a lot of the same songs. Maybe a little more variety or bring in some new artists that maybe like the chosen ones.,pandora
11/26/2014,Seems okay will update later.,pandora
1/9/2014,Seems okay. Really haven't used it much.,pandora
3/4/2016,seems to be always reliable,pandora
7/9/2015,Seems to be an android phone app they just ported over to kindle. Could have more data and better layout but it's just bigger.,pandora
12/9/2014,"Seems to get buggy a lot, there's updates like every few weeks and probly 60% of the time I try to start it, it just goes to a black screen and my phone asks ""this app is not responding, do you want to close it or wait?"" When it works it's great, but sometimes I'd rather just go to youtube",pandora
12/20/2013,"Seems to have good music,with out too many commercial interruptions. I've been enjoying it.",pandora
3/25/2016,Seems to know what I want to hear!!,pandora
8/10/2016,Seems to work well... Like the fact we can listen to our stations on the Kindle when any time we like...,pandora
3/3/2015,"Select performers that reflect the mood you're in and enjoy. An occasional click to say like or dislike
 will have various types of music well managed.",pandora
3/10/2013,"Selection of music is good. But way, way, way too many ads on the free service. I'd rather just choose an FM radio station that plays music I like. Very disappointing.",pandora
9/6/2017,Selection of music is great,pandora
6/19/2017,"Selection of music is outstanding. Thank you, Pandora.",pandora
5/18/2016,selection of songs IS THE BEST! Really enjoy listening to Pandora. Try to keep it on as much as possible,pandora
6/14/2016,"Selection, responsiveness, and it's free. I have it on my iPhone, PC, and Kindle and it provides music when I want it.",pandora
2/24/2014,"Seriously Pandora, where did the Exit or Quit button go for the app on the Kindle Fire HD? The only way to stop is to go into the app settings and forceclose it... But then it might ""Misbehave"" haha.. It's already misbehaving!! While you are fixing that glitch, you might want to consider a sleep timer. That would be a wonderful addition to your app...
 
 adding one extra star, the menu button is now fixed on the Kindle Fire, now we can ""quit"" instead of forceclosing, thank you.
 A sleep timer will complete the app and make it 5 star!
 
 I am not sure about the problems others are having, songs not completing, ads, etc. All my stations play perfectly, always have. as far as ads, I am usually doing something besides staring at the album art so I rarely notice the ads, sometimes there is a break for an audible ad, but no big deal.
 If the ads bother you, it's easy to fix, just get the paid app.
 After several hours of using the app it will pause and ask if you are still listening. All you got to say is yes or no... if you aren't it will stay paused. no big deal and I appreciate that.",pandora
12/28/2013,"Seriously, I get 40 hours a month ""free""... A FARKING MONTH???
 
 Total BS IMO. No, there's no problem with the $3 monthly charge on the 'pay"" side of the house but calling your supremely limited 'ad supported' ""FREE"" makes Pandora the ""Free Credit Report.Com"" liars of the app set.",pandora
11/15/2012,serves its purpose,pandora
9/14/2013,Set the mood with this AP. Better than a radio station since you pick yor themes. This AP should be on your device!,pandora

12/28/2013,Set your music and enjoy.,pandora
12/25/2012,"She goes everywhere with me such as to the gym, shopping, and walking the dog. I love her style; in fact she has many! So far I've listed over 15 different ""styles"" and use her ""shuffle"" feature so that I'm never bored with the same tract line-up.
 Pandora is easy to customize and user-friendly, especially for this techno-challenged user. Kudos to Pandora's creators!",pandora
12/27/2014,She had plans to burn all this music for her new 3.6 Galaxy Player she received for Christmas and hasn't burned one song since downloading this app. Nice as it keeps me from doing most of the burning. Thanks Pandora for keeping my nights free!,pandora

8/27/2015,Simply Magnificent!,pandora
3/15/2016,Simply put they have too many commercials and not enough music. I prefer Sirius XM myself. Commercial freeand it works on lots of devices.,pandora
8/18/2015,Simply the best as you can make your own stations from comedy to oldies. Cheaper than satellite radio endless commercials.,pandora
5/19/2013,Simply the easiest best way to have music of a certain genre playing for any particular event. Supremely easy and user friendly.,pandora
12/29/2014,Since adobe has decided to not allow linux based operating systems to stream audio guess this is the only option we have to listen to music but I've never been that impressed with pandora.,pandora
5/10/2015,"Since I am brand new to this new experience (thanks to my daughter), I haven't had a chance to put many artists on my kindle yet, but what I do have is delightful to have playing as I read or play games. I would never have heard about this or enjoyed this app on my own. Thanks!",pandora

7/10/2013,"Since Pandora is free over the internet and wi-fi, I assumed, wrongly, that it would be free on my tablet. The app works fine, but know in advance that Pandora will charge you a fee to listen on your Kindle. I will try to connect using my internet connection to see if I can listen for free that way and will let you know.",pandora

9/5/2013,"Since starting to use Pandora, my listening has broadened so much. Rusted Root, Hayley Westernra, Fun....not on my radar before Pandora. Reminds me of the Napster days...people can share their musical interests and help other listeners. Great.",pandora
12/19/2012,Since the most recent update my kindle does nothing but skip songs constantly and won't play anything,pandora
10/8/2013,Single artists stations. Say like for example ( Bob Segar Radio) a station that ONLY plays songs by BOB SEGAR ( not similar artists too) thank you!!!,pandora

8/31/2013,So awesome you can die,pandora
12/29/2014,So awesome! I love that I can type in any song/artist/or movie that I'm thinking of and it will play similar songs. It usually takes forever to hear the particular song I was lookaying for. But I hear some other great ones along the way :),pandora

 and i havent been usin it that long",pandora

5/26/2016,So far it's great!!,pandora
8/7/2015,So far I've had this app for about a month now on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Plays in the background while I'm working other apps and is way better then Spotify. I had Spotify for a week and I hated it. Only drawback it that it drains battery power pretty fast. but I guess that's to be expected.,pandora

2/5/2017,So my BlackBerry did this &#34;major mandatory phone update. So when it finished I has happy to see all these apps that I can't got from the BlackBerry store. This is the 3rd app that I have downloaded and it failed to say why. It opens even but totally unusable. I have been wanting Pandora back for like forever. It would really be a cool thing to do if you opened the app store and it have an option that you could click on that you were either an Android user or a BlackBerry user. I've only downloaded 3 apps and had to just delete thm. A little help Amazon.,pandora
1/30/2017,so my music cant be fetched on any station now. really Pandora? not one single station can play music not even when I close the app and reopen OR shy down my kindle and restart,pandora

11/13/2014,So Pandora did an update and they can now access my contacts and send them emails without my permission. I loved Pandora but I will not risk them sending stuff to my many contacts especially since a lot if them are professional contacts. Goodbye Pandora. Lookaying for something else now.,pandora
5/2/2017,"So so so much music!
 Can't believe it!",pandora
4/12/2013,So the variety is good. I just have to figure out if I can stand the ads. The visual ones are o.k. but the spokayen ones are annoying.,pandora
7/1/2015,So this app can only be used in America ! Wow! Here I was about to pay so I would be happy to change songs when I wanted and I can't get the app to open ! Y'all just lost a customer !,pandora
3/19/2014,So this app is amazing but I wish you could listen to a song more than once but it is still great,pandora
1/4/2014,"So when I downloaded this app, I found that it's conveniently possible to have it play in the background, on your phone. I didn't mind the idea of watching ads, because it's a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow. But if you ask for music from a certain band, it will give you a 1/6 chance of hearing that band, a 2/6 chance of hearing a similar band, and a 1/2 chance of hearing a band that is nothing like what you asked for. But that's not all; the graphic ads pop up randomly, overtop 3/4 of your playlist navigation, which often causes any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music, to send you to another ad. I wish the annoyance ended there, but for every minute of music you're given, willingly or not, it gives you a minute and a half of pop-up video ads as well. Trying to flip to another song only results in it informing you that you're not allowed to skip songs, if you try more than 3 times an hour, and forget useful buttons like ""rewind""; if you try to tap the track to hear something again, it only puts a "" like/dislike"" on the track. I was unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten seconds over again, MARKED THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN, and my attempt to change the thumbs down mark to a thumbs up, when clicking the previously listed song, put a like on its album, didn't take the dislike off the song, and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I didn't want to be hearing. In essence, I wasted twice as much time listening to ads and songs I didn't want to hear, than hearing music I actually wanted, AND I gave these twits my e-mail for that lovely opportunity.",pandora
2/20/2017,So when I first downloaded the app I LOVED it. Then I updated it and it told me that I have exceeded the amount of hours I can listen to the radio this month and its only a week into April. now I have to pay monthly to listen to the music with unlimited hours. Or I pay. 99 cents for the rest of the month. what happened to Pandora:(,pandora
7/22/2017,So yeah...rn I'm listening to a bunch of electronica which is electronic music XD . You can listen to all of you favorite bands on this thingy OwO,pandora
4/10/2013,"SO, I actually love when apps get updates, because I love to see all the new features that it contains. For this app, in particular...Well, let me first start off with this. I've been a huge Pandora fan, for so long. Maybe even over four years. I have it on every device that I have, but I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to switch I Heart Radio, but I can't. I But now, I believe it might be time to find a new radio. This app sucks now. The new symbol bothered me at first, but I'm used to it. But as soon as Pandora updated to 5.0, MY STATIONS DON'T PLAY. It keeps saying, 'We cannot find any more music for this station. Please, try a different station.' I did almost one hundred times and it keeps saying that. Pandora, you're about to lose a customer, if you don't get it together.",pandora
2/20/2017,"So, I got this app and signed up. After I entered my info, it wouldn't let me sign up! I tried new passwords, but to no avail! What exactly could be the problem? I am familiar with Pandora and I think it's an awesome app, so I'm giving it a four star rating because it's awesome, but won't let me sign up!",pandora
11/3/2013,Solid,pandora
5/2/2016,Solidly built. I was actually surprised. Have enjoyed it so far.,pandora
9/25/2015,Some commercials are too long but overall it is a great app. Create your own channel with your favorite music and enjoy!,pandora
8/16/2015,"Some commercials, excellent music selection. I like how easily it knows my preferences, thank a mathematician right",pandora
9/26/2012,"some of the best music you will find anywhere, any time, any type or style.",pandora
11/23/2014,"Some of the channels are limited in song selection (especially if you're into Big Band, Sinatra, etc.)---may hear the same tune several times in any one session. I'm also against listening to Christmas songs in July, and I haven't discovered how to move it to my Christmas station without deleting it completely.",pandora
3/28/2017,some of the songs and singers i do not like. i just rate it thumbs down and it will change the song and singer. i would recommend pandora to all who likes to listen to your favorite singers and others while working on their computers.,pandora
9/20/2013,Some problems finding acts I wanted to hear but overall enjoyable.,pandora
1/5/2013,Some songs are nice. I do not like the shuffel feature,pandora
7/1/2016,"Some songs, I couldn't get, I guess, some you just don't have or have never heard of.",pandora
12/8/2014,Some stations I can listen to for a half hour and not hear the artist I wanted.,pandora
7/17/2016,"Some things about this irk me. You are supposed to be able to hear a song repeat after watching an ad, but it doesn't repeat. The ads are the same over and over. When I put a groups name in for my station, I want the majority of music from that group, not everyone but the group.",pandora
4/8/2015,Some very good music .??,pandora
1/15/2017,someone use my credit card without my permossion,pandora
2/27/2016,Sometime in genres repeats a song. Not a huge deal.,pandora

6/27/2016,Sometimes glitches but 98% of the time works great,pandora
10/18/2016,Sometimes i have a hard time getting it to come in,pandora
7/22/2015,"Sometimes I like to pick a certain type of music to relax, rock out too or create a certain mood.",pandora
9/2/2016,"sometimes I wish we can pick certain songs, or replay a song. listen to this app all day long. love it. like music? get this app!! (:",pandora
9/12/2014,"Sometimes I'm in the mood for World, or George Winston-type New Age piano, or broader New Age stuff. So those are my current formats on Pandora! ""Followers"" can listen in, too. (I don't mean Facebookay; Pandora has their own system.) Pandora's computers play stuff for you based on your initial stated preference of artist or song each time you're in the mood for something you haven't been listening to on Pandora yet. And you are able to vote each song up or down, or to skip the current piece. It's basically an interactive music collection, vastly larger than the records or tapes or discs you could or would store at home. OTOH it doesn't make you assemble and buy song by song like for your own iPod either. They've scientifically analyzed recorded music based on elements like tempo, culture, mood, rhythm, instrumentation, even key, time signature, etc., and base their choices for you on the characteristics contained in your first choice, as well as on your subsequent votes. (They really want your votes too. If you go too long without voting, they'll stop and post a notice making sure you're still listening, and remind you they can't afford ""playing to an empty room""!)
 
 The free service includes audio and even video commercials, even ones local to your market. I don't usually mind, in fact, as an old radio hand, I like how ""stop-sets"" break it up a little, especially in the absence of DJs or news. Some ads are targeted for your gender, too. But I heard a political ad recently, which I felt violated the mood. Also, sometimes songs or ads get cut off. And they do warn you this can chew up alot of your monthly MBs or GBs. You can pay to stop the ads and improve sound quality even more than what I find perfectly adequate for my laptop or tablet speakers, currently $36US/year IIRC, and I might do that, as this US election year promises/threatens to carpet-bomb us with ads of the worst kind yet.
 
 If your screen is big enough they also send, with each song as it's playing, album art, artist information if available, and the scientific reasons why they think this song fits your format (though I'm not sure ""headnodic"" is a word!!). So I've learned a lot about music I've always wondered about... without the financial pain of buying discs or songs blindly.
 
 One thing you can't do is request *by* format or scientific characteristic. I'm part Native American, but city-raised, so I just typed that into the box; but if you don't know an artist or song title, the system can't help you.
 
 You can also get the service through [...], without this app, but I don't know how that would work out on a smaller device.
 
 Long story short, this may be the future of music radio -- ""narrowcasting,"" even self-help.",pandora
2/6/2014,Sometimes it does something weird and says there are no songs available on this station. Don't know how to fix it. Usually just have to wait for it to resolve on it's own.,pandora

3/23/2015,Sometimes it takes a long time for Pandora to start. I'd like to be able to play a certain song sometimes too and there's no control over that --not that I know of.,pandora

9/11/2014,Spotify is so much better you don't have a skip limit and there is less adds,pandora
1/28/2016,Spotify is way better. Pandora has really lost its touch over the years. Only 6 skips per hour? That's ridiculous! I'm going to uninstall and go back to Spotify.,pandora
11/11/2016,"Spotify is WORLDS better and the premium is a rip off! $4.99 a month!? It's barely worth a lifetime membership for $4.99 and the only reason I was signed up is because I accidentally tapped to close to sign up instead of no thanks on the free version and there was conveniently no ""are you sure"" screen next just went right ahead and signed me up for an auto renewing membership. Canceling it is not as simple as one easy click. It can be tricky to find where to cancel your membership once your signed up if your not to families with whatever device you are running it on. I used to enjoy the free version but didn't like having no choice in what actually played after seeing what little difference the premium version makes for the price I will never be on pandora again even if the premium was free.",pandora

1/30/2015,The ability to hear my style of music anytime was the reason I got the Kindle Fire - and I am very happy that I did. I am not exactly gadget literate so I was pleased that Pandora is easy to use and the sound is very good as well. I've already read one bookay on my Kindle and enjoyed that as well.,pandora
5/1/2013,The ability to tailor your own station content is a very good feature.,pandora
9/18/2012,The absolutely best music service available. I am introduced to new music based on my preferences and also hear my favorites from a variety of genres. Very little repetition through the week and somehow the algorithm they use manages to intuit what type of music I might like at night or on a weekend vs. mid-week. I just love Pandora!,pandora
10/21/2015,The ad supported Kindle version just does not work reliably. Music stops and I hear nothing but am told that an ad is playing. And music does not return. Not much good in this form.,pandora
10/8/2012,"The addition of an alarm clock is a nice feature, but it's not working on my locked device. I wokaye up and discovered the screensaver on and burning up the battery, but no music until I entered my password. Maybe there is a workaround? Hopefully would not require yet another Android permission. How much personal data do you guys need to collect? I'm sure ad revenue and paid versions generate considerable profit. We know the musicians are not being compensated appropriately. As far as the app's overall consistency I will say that things run smooth and it is enjoyable to hear mainstream &#34;radio&#34; hits from time to time. One thing I liked about the old Yahoo Music Jukebox (an earlier platform of audio streaming Pandora seems to have modeled itself on) was having the opportunity to hear much deeper tracks from artists I never knew about.",pandora

6/20/2014,The ads and not letting you skip more than a couple songs are really irritating. Especially when you cant add a specific song. I will listen to it because it is free. Will not pay for the supposed add free version. That is why you purchase the music and put in a CD.,pandora
10/10/2016,The ads are ridiculous. There are apps that do the same thing for free and you don't have to wait for the ads to run.,pandora
7/18/2015,The ads are the worst. It's difficult to delete the stations.,pandora
1/25/2014,"The ads are very annoying, but the app continues to play music on my kindle, even if I'm using a different app.",pandora
11/1/2017,"The ads are way louder than the music. The music times out too soon. I like to set it for long periods. The stations' music selections are too commercial and repetitive. I listen to classical, so why do I have to keep hearing Vivaldi's "" the seasons"" every day? How about some in depth recordings of certain composers on different days?",pandora
10/9/2014,"The ads have gotten out of control on my Fire HD. App ads pop up every time I adjust the volume (in Pandora). I had 4 pop ups within the first minute of the 1st song playing immediately after launching Pandora (first time). Not acceptable, think I need to find an alternate program.",pandora
9/2/2017,"The ads seem to load just fine, but the music plays for usually 1 second and it pauses, and hitting play doesn't work. This is the 3rd update in a row that has done this. This was nice when it worked.",pandora
1/26/2013,"The ads suck but not paying for the service is worth the hassle. Quality audio, little to no issues experienced.",pandora
4/17/2016,"The ads suck, but love it!",pandora
4/4/2012,"The alarm goes off. That's cool. If you so much as touch it, it turns completely off. No snooze -nothing! Was 1 1\2 hrs late to work.",pandora
9/2/2016,"The android app doesn't let you create new stations from a song currently playing, among other functionality present in the web version. Also songs take a long time to load sometimes, which is annoying, I don't like having gaps of silence between songs. Other than that I like the Pandora Android App a lot!",pandora
1/31/2016,"The app allows access to your previously selected stations. Functions well. Making changes to any of your selections is easier by visiting the website, then use the app to access what you have already set up.",pandora
11/16/2012,The App appeared to download and it launched but would not work or give me any options for getting music or adding any stations.,pandora
11/21/2016,"The app constantly stops playing music. It will play a few songs and stop, usually when an ad pops up. You can purchase the ad free app though, but I haven't so not sure how well that works. I have talked to several others and they have had this same problem with the Pandora app. Not enjoyable",pandora
12/20/2013,"The app does what it is meant to, open a direct link to your Pandora account. It doesn't do anything else because it doesn't have too. You could accomplish the same effect by creating a short cut, but I find this slightly more convenient.",pandora
12/14/2012,"the app doesnt open up let alone play music...having the same problem with youtube, both are on fire tablet....i have a 4 year old Motorola photon phone that streams with NO PROBLEM.....",pandora
2/25/2015,"The app doesn't play the whole song through, and it will just outright not play one after a failed advert didn't even play. You have to skip it. Please fix this app Pandora. I love the content but this app is awful. And even seeing as there have been quite a few complaints about the same problems, you don't seem to be in a hurry to fix it.",pandora
4/19/2016,The app doesn't work it won't play anything.,pandora
1/4/2013,the app doesn't work.,pandora
2/10/2016,"The app downloaded, and then put the blue-background logo page on the screen. then NOTHING else. No login, no buttons, no stream, no music. No instructions, no info on ""System requirements"", no Help.",pandora
2/10/2017,The app goes great with my Kindle and I love music so I had to add it to every portable device.,pandora
11/28/2013,"The App In Use The Most, Top Notch",pandora
3/8/2013,"The app is constantly stopping, I have to restart it all day long.",pandora
1/30/2017,The app is easy to use and has a good layout. The only thing I didn't like was how close together the rating and skip buttons are to each other. It was too easy to tap the wrong button. Everything else worked great.,pandora
9/22/2017,The app is free and AWESOME!!! I listen to it every single night. Who ever doesn't have the app GET IT!!!!,pandora
3/22/2014,The app is good in general but sucks in Amazon tablets.,pandora
3/9/2014,"The app is great sometimes, but for the majority it just freezes on the opening screen and is more or less useless now. I don't recommend this for your kindle fire until they fix it but it works great on my phone. Cant wait for this to be fixed!",pandora
2/8/2016,The app is great!,pandora
9/2/2013,"The app is great, but you have 2 wait 1hour for a skip. So it stuck on one song fur an hour. Also its kinda hard to get a certain song. I tried to get scream and shout but I only got the remix.",pandora
7/10/2014,The app is okay but I can't afford paying it hand it's dumb you can't skip sometimes,pandora
4/17/2013,The app is okayay. It play great music but the fact is you search the music you wanna hear from a certain artist or band and it brings up this whole other thing!,pandora
2/16/2015,The app is too confusing so I do not use it,pandora
10/3/2012,The app is user friendly. You can build your own music stations. If you don't like a song just press the thumbs down icon and it won't be played again.,pandora
1/23/2015,The app is very well made and helpful for me to play my favorite music.,pandora
1/30/2013,"The app itself has a great layout and it functions fine most of the time. The only real issue I see is that the app continues to crash at random points while I'm listening to my music. While this is an issue I hope gets fixed quickly, I don't think you shouldn't get it just for that reason. The music plays fine and it goes on for a good hour or so before shutting off. I rate this 4/5 only because of that one problem.",pandora
7/22/2015,"The app itself is okay, but Pandora is getting a little long in the tooth. The constant commercials, the extremely lacking selection, and constant repeats are getting annoying. Back in the day I used Pandora to find new bands, but lately they've been getting stagnant (and redundant). It seems they're going for ""hits"" instead of music that doesn't get played on the Top40.
 
  I've moved on to Spotify for the most part, but once in a while will come back to see if they've added anything I like. However, even after a few hours it's still the same songs (not just bands) that played the last time I listened to it. There's hardly any variety with songs and/or bands anymore.
 
 Maybe this is a side effect of using the free (or mobile) version; or maybe they just have a very limited selection for specific bands, but it doesn't compel me to buy into it; there's plenty of other options.",pandora
12/30/2016,"The app itself works farily well and has most features you would want. Pandora is never free! You either pay $36/yr for Pandora One with no commercials on the screen or audio, or you pay with your loss of time, self dignity and sanity by allowing Pandora to force feed you audio and video ads between songs. Far from free. Yes, I know millions of Americans have been conditioned to tolerate intrusive advertising in their daily life but there is a cost to you. It has conditioned you to make compromises in your quality of life for no legitimate reason, just the corporate greed trying to leach upon your every moment of the day. Don't let them do it. The 'free' Pandora is a preview service only for your introduction to the concept. Pay the $36/yr for Pandora One, sending a clear message you value your time and dignity too much to be force fed advertisments. Reviews here keep saying there is no way to turn it off but on my Kindle Fire HD there are at least 3 ways I came across with only a minute's effort. You can hit the pause button during a song to stop it. You can explore the icons on the screen and find several ways to log off. Of course this means you must re-enter your email and password later so I just hit the pause button. If you don't like the occasional prompts that ask if you are still there, send the following message to Pandora Customer Support: ""I don't care what you pay in royalties, just charge us what you must to provide completely uninterrupted service like other services and satellite radio offers."" Take charge of your technology, don't let your technology take charge of you!",pandora
3/21/2017,The app just stops then five to ten minutes later it starts again. Will not reload once stopped have to keep trying then maybe it'll start again.,pandora
7/7/2013,The app keeps force closing.,pandora
6/19/2014,The app keeps on stopping and freezing.,pandora
4/5/2017,The app mirrors my smart phone and iPad apps which I thoroughly enjoy. Being able to customize the apply for my listening tastes is excellent. The free version does not have excessive advertisements. Enjoy! (PS: Be mindful that the app uses data in the smart phone when used away from WiFi.,pandora
11/3/2015,The app randomly saves pictures of a black and white Pandora Radio icon. I don't know why but I'm getting sick of it.,pandora
9/13/2015,The app recently updated and now it won't load on my device. I have checked every other reason for it not to work and discovered it is just that app that is not working on my phone.,pandora
2/17/2016,"The app said it was trying to connect, when I had full bars. Why is it doing this?",pandora
1/20/2016,The app updates every night with no actual update.,pandora
7/1/2017,The app wanted to be allowed to do allot of bad stuff to my tablet so I did not download.,pandora
11/3/2015,the app was better with the black background. less in your face feel to it. and known. ehh. also the ads have become more frequent then the music so I might delete it,pandora
8/15/2014,The app was not compatible with the Kindle I had - very difficult to finally figure it out.,pandora
9/10/2012,the app was working fine but it git to the point where I herd 2 songs at the same time my sister has the same problem,pandora
1/18/2017,The app when it loaded it wouldn't let register do not recommend,pandora
11/27/2012,"The app will not play music! It will play a single song, and then will stop playing. It wil show the next song, but won't let me hit play, skip, etc. I love Pandora, but will have to listen to music elsewhere if the app doesn't even work!",pandora
11/20/2015,"The app won't even load, it says I have no connection (WiFi) but any other WiFi needing app loads perfectly. I normally use these app constantly but due to this I haven't been able to use it once in weeks.",pandora
2/13/2016,"the app won't start for my kindle. I like pandora but with the app crashing on my device, I'm disappointed.",pandora

3/18/2015,"The app worked before and when I turn the kindle off to charge and then turn it back on,it doesn't work anymore",pandora
12/7/2015,The app works as well as I expected. I can listen to my favorite Pandora channels on my Trio Android internet device with no dropouts.,pandora
12/23/2013,"The app works fine, I just dislike all of the long pauses for commericals. Overall, the variety of stations and the way in which you can personalize the music that you want to listen to is appealing.",pandora
5/5/2013,the app works good. it is fast and plays whatever you are doing. you should get this app its worth it b,pandora
2/22/2013,"The app works great. However, there are times when you can't load the app or it might just not let you log in. I found that using another app, exiting, and then coming back to Pandora usually works.
 A solid 4 / 5.",pandora

10/22/2015,"The computer version works well. Echo, so so.",pandora
3/29/2014,The concept is great. I do believe that Pandora knows that I am a Sirius user and play more commercials than my friends who do not subscribe to Sirius.,pandora

3/14/2014,The eye of the light is turned backwards on fold lenses,pandora
2/6/2013,"The fact that Pandora continues to add ""stations"" turns an otherwise good idea into a normal/regular radio station which plays a large percentage of music one did not want to hear to begin with. Just because I like the Greatful Dead does not mean I will like Bob Marley for instance, so if I give something a thumbs down it should not form a. New radio station. And that's what makes Pandora suck, though the concept is great.",pandora
3/29/2016,"The fact you can create your own ""stations""...fun!
 You can create specific genres which is a great thing so you
 don't have to listen to 'crap'.",pandora
3/31/2015,the features and the platform of pandora are pretty good. but the songs that are played can become very repetitive. I think this can be fixed by playing more than just the hits. I think there are plenty of other songs on albums that never get played which could add a lot more variety.,pandora
11/1/2013,"The first time I opened it, it closed by it self. the second time it worked fine. the third time it ccomes up to the loading page but never goes any further! I love Pandora but. for some reason it's not working right for me! I hope this gets fixed! :(",pandora

1/15/2012,The format and layout of Pandora is unbeatable compared to others. I always choose Pandora over my Itunes Radio App any day,pandora
8/22/2014,The free app works well and gives very good service and provides the music you want. Advertisements pop up but you are listening to music and can certainly ignore the inconvenience.,pandora
12/17/2013,"The free appliction works great but a little crude for the Kindle, on the ipad it is fantastic.. I love it and bought a subscription to pandora.",pandora
1/28/2013,"The free music portion is great and the app has few to little glitches, but the app isn't quite at the quality of some of its competitors. They need to offer more choice music rather than suggested music, or just music of similar nature to what I requested. Between this and spotify, I choose spotify, but this is still an app worth getting.",pandora
2/27/2013,The free Pandora Kindle Fire app interrupts the music with advertisement. It also stops playing music and asks if you want to upgrade to a fee version - you have to answer and then tell it to go back to playing the music. If you want some background music while working around the house this isn't a very good option. I went back to playing Pandora on my Blue-ray player because it doesn't have as many interruptions.,pandora
1/30/2015,"The free version has a ridiculous amount of commercials. Initially it wasn't too bad, but the more Pandora was played, the more commercials were played. Also, many of the the pop up ads have an adult theme to them, so beware of the commercial/ad content. I'm sure their idea is to breakdown the user by having so many commercials that they'll download the app with the monthly fee. Boo! :(",pandora
12/22/2013,the free version has limited ads. I had difficulty in selection a program.,pandora
4/4/2014,The free version is fine except for the advertisments. Provides good selections based on the ratings that you give. The paid version is too expensive since I already have Amazon prime music.,pandora
4/27/2016,The free version is okayay easy to make playlist,pandora
12/1/2014,The free version is wonderful. It has not failed me yet. I like how I am able to create my own stations and it gives me music in that genre. Thanks for easy listening.,pandora
7/30/2017,The free version isn't worth it. I have already deleted this app from my Kindle Fire. The pop- up ads totally annoyed me.,pandora
2/24/2014,"The free version of Pandora plays music at 128K, which is only good for people who have very low standards in audio quality. Pandora One has 192K sound, but the quality is nowhere near iTunes Radio. The game is over for Pandora. Apple is choosing people who are pillars of music to choose their own playlists, and the lack of crappy songs that comes with Pandora is but a memory.",pandora
1/12/2013,The free version of this software did not deliver what was promised. I could not get it to to play music at all. Could not evaluate if it was really worth buying or not!,pandora
9/25/2013,The free versions' adds (especially the pop ups) are very disruptive and worse than other services I'm aware of.I'm considering the paid version but checking other services more closely first.,pandora

10/1/2013,The icon for the carousel and favorites is extremely pixelated it is annoying please fix it but other than that it is a great app and I have been a pandora one user for a few years,pandora
12/26/2012,The idea of the program is great. But there are problems. One that occurs routinely is the loss of signal. The program will need to buffer. When that happens I need to open the application manager to force a program stop. Then when the program is reloaded it works again. Until the next time. A little more variety in audio programming would be good,pandora
3/16/2013,The interface is not as intuitive as it is on the Desktop/laptop apps. But does till run fast. It is a little harder to add more artists,pandora

 Lyrics automatically displayed for the selected song.
 Creating favorite stations is so fun it's addictive!
 Only drawback is that the startup page doesn't have an option to save the users email address for login.",pandora
5/1/2014,"The interface was obviously intended for a larger screen than the standard ""Fire"" tablet, so some of the buttons are a little too small. Otherwise it works exactly as you'd expect.",pandora
2/24/2014,"The interruption on the free version is VERY annoying! either pay them or deal with ads every minute... song not ever finish the ""dj"" system is horrible.",pandora
2/2/2016,the is one of the best music apps that I know unless you know a nother one please tell me and thank you.,pandora
5/14/2013,"The issues I have are with the app itself for a Kindle Fire, not necessarily for Pandora as a whole. There are certain ads you have to physically open the app for on your Fire to watch/listen to. If you don't Pandora just stops, doesn't play any more music, but stays open. There isn't any way to skip or pause the music unless you, once again, physically open the app. You can only see what song is playing and the band who performs it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu. There are some minor issues with songs randomly pausing half way through and then skipping unannounced and without prompting to the next song. The ads on this version of the app are longer and more frequent than on my Android phone, iPod or laptop versions.",pandora
5/8/2013,The item wasn't real. I tried to get them to return the item and they wouldn't,pandora
3/24/2016,The itself works great but it's a shame there are no widgets to use with the locked screen like Android version,pandora
6/6/2017,"The kind of music I like, whenever I want it.",pandora
11/2/2014,"The Kindle Edition of Pandora is good when it works, but that isn't often. The app closes on me frequently, especially when I have a good rotation of songs going. I do not use it on my Kindle Fire as often as I would like because of this. I've updated my device and the app itself and have seen absolutely no improvement on performance. Hopefully, this issue can be resolved in the near future, because I use my Kindle Fire quite often and I would love not to have to juggle two devices just to listen so music.",pandora
5/15/2016,The Kindle Fire is not the best device for audio applications.,pandora
10/19/2015,The last update brokaye it. I only get a blue screen with pandora in the center and 7.0 in the lower right hand corner. After that it goes black sometimes locking up my Galaxy S5 phone.,pandora
9/2/2015,"The latest and greatest version of Pandora is leaving something to be desired. The lockscreen widget only displays song info; to pause or skip, you have to unlock your device and go into the full app. The home screen widget now causes the app to crash if any buttons are used, and sometimes just trying to open the app. The developers have some work to do...",pandora
4/5/2016,The latest release is fraught with issues.,pandora
4/14/2015,"The latest update has eliminated song lyrics, a HUGE miss.
 Also, I was paying $36 a year, $3 a month, for Pandora One. Not a bad price for no ads and a higher quality stream.
 Now, they want $4.99 a month, a HUGE 166% PRICE INCREASE, with no annual payment option. Thanks, but no thanks.
 Given Pandora's limited song repertoire and excessive ads and commercials, it's just not worth it.
 it's time to move on. There are better options out there.",pandora
4/29/2016,The latest version is cumbersome. The older version was so much easier to navigate. The old version kept my stations in alphabetical order. I didn't have to navigate to a different to quit. I would not havr updated had I known this.,pandora
11/10/2014,The limit is annoying but that is I enjoy it when i want good music Pandora it doesn't always play the artist channel it is mix but other wise really good for the fire,pandora
1/17/2013,The low rating is because Pandora is not available to us as we are outside the US much of the time.,pandora
3/20/2012,The luxury of being able to customize your choice of music to whatever mood your feeling is truly a convenience.,pandora
11/14/2015,The mobile app is easy and the music isn't bad,pandora
1/28/2014,The monthly Bill isn't bad can not pick the artist or the songs but still a good station,pandora
12/7/2016,"The more I express my likes and dislikes on each of my stations the better become the selections Pandora picks for me. I love that I can listen to it anytime on my phone: working in the garden, walking in the morning, going shopping, etc. I highly recommend it. It's easy. Even a 69 year old grandma can set it up!",pandora
7/14/2017,the More you use it the better its choices get,pandora
8/8/2014,"The more you use it, the better it tailors the music to your taste. Wife has it on whenever the Kindle is in the room for recharging.
 Free service has ads, but they're less annoying than the radio. Great product, and you can't beat the price!",pandora
4/25/2016,"The MOST successful way to have not commercial music and the variety is endless. Yes, it is worth the purchase.",pandora
12/18/2013,"The music everyone develope's is independently their own. There is massive amounts of style.

3/3/2014,"The music fits whatever mood I'm in. I just put in one of my favorite artists, and many selections come up that fit that style, as well as the times, of the artist I've chosen. I really like it. The commercials are quick and minimal. Hard to believe that this is free!!",pandora

12/22/2014,The music is free and offers a wide variety of music to choose from. Just would like to be able to pass over songs more frequently.,pandora
3/10/2014,The music is free I enjoy listening to it when I am exercising. It's not any song I can't find on it,pandora
8/22/2013,"The music is good, but it will not play! Help please!",pandora
2/8/2014,"The music is good, but when I want a certain artist like Taylor Swift, they play 1 TS song at the beginning and then a bunch of random songs. I just want Taylor Swift!!
 Also, they only let you skip 6 songs per hour which is crap. Unlimited skips please!!",pandora
12/25/2015,"The music is good, the thing is easy to use, there aren't too many radio interruptions, maybe three per hour. The thing I don't like is it asks for your age and gender. Suggestion: put the wrong gender down so if your a man you don't get all of these &#34;single woman&#34; pop up ads and women vise versa.",pandora
2/4/2012,The music is great and end less.,pandora

11/10/2015,The music is great. Excellent selections.,pandora
1/19/2015,The music is great. You can choose one or two songs you really like and it will build your playlist. I have been enjoying it on the Kindle and on the computer.,pandora

8/25/2013,"The music of whatever you are interested in, or were interested in, right at your finger tip. I listened while I painted a room and the time flew by. We listen while cleaning, building puzzles or anytime. Very relaxing.",pandora
12/29/2014,The music on this app is incredibly great.,pandora
3/18/2013,"The music plays even if I'm not in the app itself, which is great. But it's a pain to have to go back to the app to pause the song playing. But other than that, no problems besides that sometimes Pandora can't load all the way so it makes itself freeze for some reason",pandora
11/18/2016,The music selection is great and it's never boring. Love it.,pandora
12/29/2013,The music selection is the best ! I listen to it all the time and shuffle my favorite genres of music,pandora
10/11/2016,"The music selections are great, true easy listening from the 40's..",pandora
3/19/2014,The music sound is clear and sharp. I really enjoy the bluetooth connection with my portable speakers. I usually turn on Pandora while I am surfing the web.,pandora
12/4/2014,"the music sounds better, but there is an odd popping noise between songs. the music skips sometimes and the volume controls are all jacked up. if i control the volume via the app, it is barley audible at high volume. if i turn it up on the device and then go into the app, the app mutes. if i use device controls while IN the app, all it does is get lower, not higher. fix please!",pandora
5/25/2014,The music sounds great! i have the kindle fire hd and the dolby sound is awesome. i highly recommend it.,pandora
9/5/2012,The music that is played is some of the best music you can ask for thru different stations no matter what kind of music you might enjoy Pandora has it,pandora
11/23/2012,The music that the kids listen to these days can be used through this app but I would also like to use it one day.,pandora

1/3/2016,the musicmusic is crystal clear and extremely easy to use and I can find The music I want in a snap,pandora
4/5/2016,"the new pandora website is terrible. why did they change a good thing. the new site has lots of bugs, hard to navigate, and over designed. Im moving over to spotify. Sorry",pandora
1/30/2014,"The new site is awful! It is significantly more complicated to use, especially when editing stations. This now requires a four step process instead of one. How stupid is that?!?!? The new site wastes so much space that could be used for navigation purposes. Music and cost is the same, but the new site STINKS!!! It's like going back in time 10 years.",pandora
3/8/2017,the new version is much easier to use. now the app shows previous songs and has a more modern lookay than rhw old dark version. would highly recommend for kindle fire,pandora
4/29/2017,"The new version of Pandora for Kindle Fire has many nice features like a sleep timer and an option to ask to temporarily not hear a tune you are tired of.
 
 I do wish it didn't require so many steps to exit the application and the mini-items to click are difficult for my visually impaired husband to see.
 
 Otherwise it is as wonderful as ever. I definitely recommend the cheep annual subscription to avoid the commercials and have extended play for hours.",pandora
9/18/2012,"The new version of Pandora on Google Play constantly crashes when using bluetooth. Never had the issue before. Couldn't find a way to fix it, then I remembered that the apps on Amazon are always out of date compared to what is on Google Play. So for once I'm glad that they are! Still 1 Star though since I have to use an older version , fix your stuff Pandora!",pandora
10/18/2013,"The obvious good is that I get to choose which songs I want and I can create several different stations for different types of music. The part I don't like is that it seems to want me to continuously interact with it to tell it what I like and don't like. It also tests my patience by throwing in songs that I do not want. I don't want a radio station that I have to babysit. I prefer music to just ""be on"" in the background. The best time to set up a Pandora account is on a long car trip, so that I had several hours to fine-tune my stations.",pandora
3/17/2015,"the one and only thing id suggest as an improvement is to do what spotify does; give us the option to pause, thumb up, thumb down, and fast forward on the pandora notification c:",pandora
4/12/2014,"The one thing i don't like is, when you hit the info button for a song and its a long write up about the band, and the song ends before your done reading, it changes when the song does.",pandora
9/4/2014,the one thing I really hate is that you cant delete a radio and I hate it because then if I hate that radio I have to listen to it!!!!!!!,pandora
8/31/2012,The online radio,pandora
9/22/2012,The only complaint is customer sreviews is not so good. It is very hard to get a live person right away when needed.,pandora
11/1/2014,"The only complaint is I have it on shuffle and I seem to hear some artist more than others, or some stations that I have selected.",pandora
12/11/2014,The only downfall is that it is internet only. I don't have wifi in the car,pandora
9/12/2014,"The only downside to Pandora is that you cannot replay a song that just played, you can skip but not hear the same song until Pandora chooses to play it again. Other than that, it's awesome.",pandora
7/24/2015,The only downside to this app is that I cannot have radio stations for the foreign music I enjoy (Japanese pop type stuff) unless it's Korean psy... other than that is great...,pandora
9/28/2012,The only flaw is the loading and amount of skips on certain song's.,pandora
4/12/2013,The only issue I am having with this app is that it went from being able to skip six songs per hour to know is like teen for all the station's in one so I might have to delete the app cause I liked six per station,pandora
7/15/2016,The only music radio I use!! Best thing in the world..,pandora
1/24/2014,"The only negative thing, to me, about this app is that I don't get exactly what song I want, but I don't mind it! It makes think about new music! I love it so much! I would recommend this app to all people who love music and like to break molds!",pandora
3/25/2015,The only problem is that the network losses station and signal a lot in the north east part of Philadelphia,pandora
11/25/2014,The only problem is the stinking commercials. Other than that I like the program.,pandora
10/17/2017,"The only problem that I have had is when my kindle has problems picking up internet signal then Pandora will go in and out, so I never know if I am going to be able to continuously listen to my music if I am moving around town/school.",pandora
6/9/2016,The only problem with Pandora is that you have to go to the app to turn it off. That's okay though.,pandora
3/4/2013,"The only reason I didn't rate it a full five stars, is because I have only been using Pandora for a short time and honestly have not yet had an opportunity to fully explore what it has to offer. But who can complain, IT'S FREE!!!",pandora
2/3/2013,The only reasons it didn't get 5 stars is because you should get more skips and on my kindle I cant figure out how to turn it off. ,pandora
12/30/2014,"The only thing I do not like is the ability to pick a song when your on your station . At least I have a hard time ,",pandora
2/2/2012,The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to pay to avoid ads. But I like being able to focus on an artist and hear related music as well.,pandora
9/7/2013,The only thing I don't like about it is that you need Wi-Fi. Other than that its perfect.,pandora
3/31/2013,"The only thing I don't like about Pandora is I have to be connected to Wifi to listen to it, so when we're travelling in the car I can't get service. Am I doing something wrong when I down load the songs and music I want?",pandora
10/5/2016,"The only thing I don't like about Pandora is, you have only five skips. And after that you have to listen to the rest of the songs.",pandora
1/20/2014,The only thing I don't like is the ads,pandora
12/5/2014,The only thing I don't like on my kindle fire is that the shuffle feature on Pandora on my kindle does not work. It does work on my husband's Ipad,pandora
12/25/2016,The only thing I use for my music and everyone should be using it too!! Always on point with the music,pandora
4/2/2014,"The only thing I wish Pandora would do is if I want to listen to a certain group, band or artist, it would only play that artist and NOT artists like them.",pandora
12/29/2013,The only thing is that sometimes you dont like a song so you skip but you can only skip but a certain amount of times a hour it says,pandora
3/9/2014,The only thing missing is a sleep timer. If it had one I would. Have given 5 stars for sure,pandora
11/25/2012,"The only thing that would be better is if there were no commercials and free! Alan Jackson radio, highly rated!",pandora
3/12/2013,The only thing that would make it better would be to actually pick songs you want to hear. It does repeat songs sometimes.,pandora
7/4/2015,The options are endless,pandora
11/26/2012,The Pandora app helps me listen to old favorites while discovering new artists! I love this app. Simple and easy to install and use!,pandora
4/25/2016,The pandora app is a great way for me to be able to listen to one of my favorite music stations on the go.,pandora
9/4/2013,The Pandora app is easy to use I'm having fun right now making radio stations to listen to I haven't got into the comedy yet although it is supposed to be fun also,pandora
4/7/2013,"The Pandora app is pretty easy to use without getting the premium version, however, as Pandora seeks to become more profitable, there are more annoying commercials that interrupt the mood.",pandora
10/27/2013,The pandora app is pretty good and it was easy to download and start. I do wish you could just play the songs you selected.,pandora
9/6/2017,"The Pandora app is really very functional and I rarely encounter problems with it... but when I do, it's extremely frustrating. The song will stop midway, only to move on to a 3 minute ad. Now my main problem with this app is that if you pause a song for more than a certain amount if time and you're on the Internet browser, the song will close and you have to go back to the homepage to restore. Other than that, it's a great app, I just wish these minor details would be fixed.",pandora
6/17/2012,"The Pandora app loads fine at home but not at school and others can access thed app but not Amazon people

5/12/2017,"The Pandora app sounds great on my Kindle Fire HD. I prefer Pandora for streaming because I like several genre of music, including jazz and Brazilian. Pandora makes accessing the sounds and instruments I like easy. Pandora definitely targets well.",pandora
6/7/2012,"The Pandora app works as promises, but, as on it does on my phone, the app occasionally freezes when you pause your music and exit the app. It is easy to fix, but really annoying.",pandora
9/6/2017,The pandora app works better for me than the actual site. I always have to refresh on my home computer to change stations :(,pandora
1/16/2014,The Pandora application for the Kindle Fire is good. I have not used it much but so far of what I have seen I like it!,pandora
11/30/2012,The Pandora is an excellent station to listen to music. it has great music to the liking of everyone who listens,pandora
1/7/2013,The Pandora Media gives the ability to listen to your favorite artist or even a variety of artist of your chose. I would most definitely recommend Pandora to everyone I talk to.,pandora

1/10/2014,The perfect music companion.,pandora
2/27/2013,"The periodicity and number of the advertisements are totally annoying and disruptive to listening - it may as well be listed & advertised as a freebie trial version. I've never used a music app that interrupted the continuity of my listening and disrupted my mood as much as Pandora does. Defeats the purpose of using such an app. I would have to buy the ad-free version to have it. There are too many other free apps that substitute and can replace this one. After all the hype, I was totally disappointed.",pandora
9/27/2016,The place where I find most awesome wedding songs. The ad sucks though.,pandora
8/21/2014,The playlist are on point all the time and the commercials don't come on too often. This is a great app!!,pandora
11/23/2015,"The playlists can range from outstanding to complete garbage. Also, there are way too many ads. Pandora has fallen far.",pandora
11/26/2012,"the pop up advertisements, I feel like I am using NetZero from back around the turn of the Millennium. I understand that if you pay for a subscription that those pop ups go away, but in this day and age people need to save $$$ any way they can, so why pay for something when you can keep the free version and just tap the pop ups away every single time they come up.",pandora
8/9/2017,"The pp just got an update that really helped smooth out a few problems or limitatikns in had, but its still got a few. Can always build a better mouse trap and all that jazz. Havent had any problems with it just not playing lile other have said. Its also awesome in the fact that it will play even when you hit the sleep button on the kindle fire hd, so you dont have to burn that baterry so much to listen to music.",pandora
1/4/2014,"The premise is wonderful... if you like this, then you may like this. I have made a lot of stations for myself, However when I select shuffle the stations the program seems to play the same few stations that I started with, and along with that, the same songs from those same stations. If I could eliminate that glich, it would be five stars all the way.",pandora
11/17/2012,"The product information indicated it was a 10-pack; 20 batteries, but I only received a 5-pack (10 batteries). It's too much trouble to complain so I just learned a lesson and will not order this item again.",pandora
12/27/2014,The product works well with my Android phone.,pandora
1/19/2014,"The program has a great interface and a good selection of music. It is easy to find the artist or style of music you want to hear. The pop ups, while annoying, are minimal. The fact that I can close my Kindle Fire and still hear the music, or work on other programs and still listen, are also great features.",pandora

1/13/2013,The radio station shuffling is a great feature. The search for music by artist is great. the similar music programing is also great. I recommend pandora,pandora
11/21/2015,The reason I don't like it is because you don't get to choose what song you want to listen to so I like spotify better but you should try it I don't like it but it's your opinion.,pandora
9/10/2013,The reason I don't like pandora is because when I want to listen to a certain song it never plays it I think they should fix that please,pandora
1/28/2015,The reason I gave 2 stars is because whenever I type a song name or the artist I don't get the song or artist I want so plz fix it only works on my phone I'm on tablet,pandora
8/25/2013,The reason I gave Pandora a 5 star rating is because I can put a favorite tune in there and Pandora will introduce me other songs & muscians similar to my favorite. This gives me openings to artists I would have probably never heard of before. It's fantastic!!,pandora
10/7/2017,"The reason that I am not giving five stars is that Pandora is restricted to some people in some other countrys.
 This is a music Media not a political establishemnt.",pandora
6/22/2016,"The reason that I gave Pandora a five is that you can make your own stations and if something does not suit your taste, you can either pass it over or give it a thumbs down and pass it over. Through these processes I have created the perfect stations for my tastes.",pandora

12/2/2013,The selections are good but too few and are repeated way too often. Each station needs twice as much variety.,pandora
6/6/2017,The selections are great,pandora
12/30/2013,"The service is an amazing idea, and I used to enjoy it. However, they let so many violent and pro-rape tracks slip through the cracks.

6/23/2016,The songs are the kind you can hear on the radio. It has a lot of Interrupting ads. It's repetitive...but it's FREE. So there is only so much complaining one can do. Good in a pinch.,pandora
7/24/2015,the songs get kind of repeditive.i think people should chose what gets played.also the appearance is a little to strange.,pandora
12/19/2013,"The songs it has been picking based on my input band have been about 75% wrong. Not just a little wrong either, but really wrong. I think if I keep whittling away at it it will work eventually. I am glad I didn't opt for the paid version.",pandora

9/2/2013,"The speakers on the Kindle Fire HD are incredible, so the Pandora app works very well. I use Pandora on my I-Phone, I-Pad, and now my Kindle Fire HD. It is an added benefit because I was to use my Kindle Fire for reading bookays only.",pandora
2/4/2013,The stand up comedy aspect of pandora radio lacks new content. A lot of the same old s*** I've heard a million times,pandora
1/13/2013,The station always plays the music ask for. Plus they add additional musicians that play the same types of music.,pandora
2/20/2015,"The stations are so much fun to listen to since I can create my own. I highly recommend it to others. It""s great to listen to at work on my phone.",pandora
7/21/2015,"The stations I've picked are great and the sound again is so powerful and clear, Kindle never skips a beat! Thank you.",pandora
1/7/2013,The stations I've tried are good,pandora
9/7/2013,The streaming quality is just okay. Limited amount of skips to next song. Too many commercials. There are many much better alternatives such as Spotify and iHeart.,pandora
7/1/2014,The technology is terrific. I have not had the occasion to do much but try it out but I am sure it will be great to be able to listen to the different kinds of music.,pandora
12/25/2016,The thing I like best about Pandora is the music and artists it selects for me. Always right on target to the sounds I like.,pandora
3/7/2014,"the things i have already received free are well worth it just for the enjoyment to me. I find it is really easy to get these thing on my kindle. Keep up the good work and don,t make it hard to down load. Thanks",pandora
5/15/2014,The title captures it - well behaved across devices. I use Pandora on other devices and it works as expected on the Kindle.,pandora
1/12/2013,"The title says it all. Music is my emotional crutch and pandora has always been there to satisfy my need while i was docked up at work or home. Now, I have the luxury of extending that comfort wherever I go thanks to pandora app!",pandora
9/14/2013,"The type of music and music styles I prefer are not the usual bebop screaming non-verbal helter skelter styles of the '80s but more the classical styles of the piano, violin, opera, and so on. Pandora let's me choose and offers suggestions of styles I may also like. Thank you.",pandora
1/14/2013,The type of music I. requested is played. How ever some songs aren't even close.Over all its still very good.Also nice and clear.,pandora
7/5/2013,The update is cool and all but lately its been glitching. Every thing is easy access and all but when listening to a song and to hear glitches every five or so seconds is annoying.,pandora
6/30/2013,The variety and quality of the selections in any category combined with an ability to delete any selections which do not comport with the style and color desired make Pandora a unique venue for listening pleasure.,pandora
11/9/2013,The variety is awesome!!!,pandora
1/20/2014,The variety is cool but it's so confusing for me. Hopefully I'll get used to it cause it seems like a really cool thing.,pandora
3/30/2016,"the variety is excellent and that is why I enjoy listen to the station,and best of all anyone can afford it's free.",pandora
6/15/2016,"The variety is great, options of how you want things are played etc. The 3.99 to have commercial free, uninterrupted play is worth it.",pandora

7/3/2016,the very best music i have ever experienced,pandora
6/14/2015,The wide selection of music available and the ability to create your own personal genre and musician stations are awesome. I just wish I could skip more than 6 songs per hour.,pandora
8/10/2017,The world sure has changed. I wish this stuff had been around when was a kid. Remember all those dang cassette tapes and later CDs we lugged around? This app is a a straight up free juke box.,pandora
5/26/2013,"Their database to ""map the music genome"" is impressive, they've been working on it for at least 6 years and although sometimes I get frustrated with a couple songs that end up in the mix, they really do share a lot of qualities that I wouldn't otherwise bunch as similar to a specific artist.
 
 One of my favorite things to do with Pandora is very similar to spending time on wikipedia... You find one artist you like and make that a new station... soon you are 7 stations away but enjoying every step of the way!",pandora
1/10/2014,There are a 2 ads about every 3 songs.,pandora
8/25/2013,"There are a couple of things about Pandora that have to do with simple, minor functions like editing/eliminating stations, that could be improved but over all I think it's a great way to stream music.",pandora
12/18/2016,"There are a lot os station formats, but you hear the same songs on a lot of the. It nags if you just listen and do not give thumbs up or down on every song, I like it for listening to a lot of songs from a single artist, and the suggestions for similar artists are handy.",pandora
8/15/2016,There are commercials unless you pay for it (I do) but $4/month does not seem that high. (I believe Spotify is the only other major streaming service at the moment. ) Wish you could pick out specific songs to play or make up specific play lists.,pandora
4/9/2014,There are far to many commercials that are shoved in your face and they are almost all sexual and unwanted.,pandora
10/2/2016,There are no limits on the selection and I love being able to choose who I want to listen to.,pandora
4/7/2014,"There are no other contenders coming close out there right now, Pandora is the best internet radio on the market. The app is stable, but sound quality could be improved just a bit.",pandora
3/4/2013,"there are no technical issues with this app and I use it all the time on my Fire. however, I don't like getting audio ads. I don't get them when I listen his the web do why via an app? also I am now getting tmobile ads in Spanish. I don't listen to music in Spanish. this is really really annoying. additionally, I cant tweak my channels on the app like I can via the web. please add this as a feature. oh, please let me see songs I previously listened to like I can on the web.",pandora
11/7/2011,"There are not a lot of ads, the stations they have are great and the songs are soooo good too I love coming on here all the time.",pandora
5/31/2012,"There are not a whole lot of apps that I'll give a 5 star rating to. This however is one of the. If I've had installed for a few moths that must mean its good. This I've had for that time frame plus. It was free, it doesn't freeze up like other apps have so this gets my 5 Star Approval.",pandora
4/9/2016,There are Renaissance and Medieval channels. Very cool.,pandora
11/26/2012,"There are some commercials sprinkled in, but still a nice free service to listen to different genres of music that you choose.",pandora
4/28/2016,There are too many commercials but the music is good.,pandora
12/30/2013,There are way to many ads in here you can't skip any songs. I now prefer the app spotify to Pandora because spotify also bases the radio off of what music you like,pandora
5/30/2017,"There are way too many adds. Once in a while an add will come up saying Why adds and then explains. 10 times or more in a song you have too close out a mini add and if you miss the x it will take you to the company's website. So annoying!
 
 It has a nice variety of songs on each channel that goes along with the genre of music you are listening to.",pandora
5/28/2013,There are way too many ads now.,pandora
8/13/2012,There are way too many pop ups for me to give it 5 stars as well as tookay many commercials,pandora
12/28/2014,There is a 40 hour limit to listening to the music on this app. I ran out of time in 3 days. I don't want to pay to upgrade so I'm stuck. That's the bad news the good news is that Pandora plays music that os completely tailored to me!!! This is one of my favorite apps,pandora
1/28/2014,"There is a deficiency with Pandora that relates to playing the same music, I guess due to their limited licensing of music. Well worth the price for a membership however!",pandora
4/13/2013,"There is a great selection of music. Only bad thing about it is there is no way to like or dislike a song when the phone is in locked mode. If there is a way to like/dislike a song while phone is in locked mode, then it will be superb.",pandora
12/28/2012,"There is a major issue causing the tracks to skip through the entire song in a matter of seconds. A song will start, and it'll jitter thirty seconds ahead every second until the song &#34;ends&#34; and it'll continue with the issue through every song that follows. I don't know the cause of this, but I hope someone fixes this.",pandora
9/4/2014,There is absolutely nothing better than to listen to the kind of music you want to when you want to with PANDORA.,pandora

 commercials for free music.",pandora
4/5/2013,There is no problem with pandora except there are to many adds that keep popping up. If you also have that problem download iheartradioshack it doesn't have adds that always pop up it's better than pandora.,pandora
5/14/2013,"There is nothing more enjoyable than being able to type in the name of an artist or music genre, then
 sit back and listen. If a tune comes on that you don't care for, simply click on the ""thumbs-down""
 icon, and another song in the genre you have selected begins to play. If you tire of one type of music, simply
 click and select a new one.",pandora
3/23/2014,There is nothing negative to be said about Pandora. App just sits right there waiting for you. It was a pre- installed app on my Smart TV and is now a downloaded on android and laptop.,pandora

3/25/2014,There selection is broad,pandora
10/26/2013,"There's a lot of reviews saying that this Pandora app has some issues, but I personally have found absolutely none (Fix your device?)
 
 This app allows you to listen to music that resembles a song or artist, and often the artist itself, with a few commercials between songs.
 
 Sometimes I might get a completely random artist, but those can be 'banned' on the station, unfortunately you can't be rid of an entire artist, only a song.
 
 From what I've experienced, this is an app that must be had.",pandora
4/13/2015,"There's no app for phone, it times out, the setup is confusing, and the box that cost $200 doesn't show what bands are playing or channel. The channels,how ever, are amazing.",pandora
9/25/2012,"There's not much to say. The app does what it's supposed to do. I do wish there was a larger buffering system, but I was able to make a 500mi road trip with minimal interruptions.",pandora
6/23/2016,There's nothing better and it's free!!,pandora
1/24/2017,There's nothing like hearing the tunes you like sounding so smooth and mellow. I just like listening to my favorite tunes on Pandora.,pandora

4/28/2014,there's to many commercails! there the same ones too. you cant lookay up a song because when you do you have to listen to a random playlist. if you lookay up feel so close by Calvin Harris you get skrillex and all these random song's!,pandora
4/7/2013,These people are crazy,pandora

4/2/2017,"They make it how you have to pay, going str8t To I Heart Radio, making you have to pay for OLD SONGS that they keep repeating please, that's why you don't hear about them anymore.

 i sympathize with other commenters who complain about the ads, but I really cant get upset about that for free music. would be nice to have greater variety in them so I didn't hear the same REI ad twenty times an hour.
 one issue... every few songs, it has a tendency to pause for a couple seconds in silence, as though the buffer hasn't caught up. hopefully they'll fix this with an update. but for this, would give five stars.",pandora

It's very rare that there are issues with the app or the connection (as long as you have a good WiFi connection of course).

Also, if you type in a band or something like Maroon 5, it'll play songs similiar to Maroon 5 along with Maroon 5 itself. !Get it! Also, the ads are usually every 3-5 songs. They are only 10-15 seconds long typically. They have ads so they can pay for the songs they play! Please get this app!",pandora
4/15/2012,this app is AMAZING! i use Pandora almost every single day! it is waaaay better than a radio because the ads are only for like 30 sec instead of 5 min. i strongly recommend this app. i wish there was a 100 star rating!,pandora

9/13/2013,"This app is awesome! You get to listen to music for free! The only thing I don't like about it is that you don't get to pick your songs... you get to pick the station you made but not the song. You make your station by typing in a band, song or singer. Then songs will play and if you like them you push the thumbs up and if you don't push the thumbs down. This app is the best! You won't regret it at all.",pandora
2/15/2014,"This app is awesome. But there is a skip limit. So if you hear a song you don't like, you can skip. But you can only skip 6 times an hour.

3/13/2016,This app is awesome. So can make your own playlists by your favorite singers or songs. And most of the songs allow you to lookay at the lyrics for that song. Another reason why this app is awesome is because you can listen to songs for hours and they never pay the same songs over and over again. You can also taste the songs if they are playing a song that u dont like then u can hit the thumb down button and it will never pay that song on that playlist again. This app is great. I highly recommend this app. The only bad thing is you only get six skips per hour on each playlist. But when your listening to Pandora time flies by!,pandora
2/14/2012,this app is awesome. works with Pandora online and you can sync so your stations online are available on kindle. needs confirmation that you are still listening about every 3-4 hours. stays on without screen so you can listen longer or at night. does have ads play but it's maybe a couple an hour. small price to pay,pandora

I love Pandora on my computer at work and even enjoy using it on my streaming devices and my phone, but for some reason it does not like working on my kindle. If I could give zero stars, I would.",pandora

3/6/2013,This app is better than Pandora for 2 reasons: FREE music and MANY FREE songs so you find more music you LIKE and you never get SICK of it because you listen to MULTIBLE songs. Defiantly download.,pandora
6/21/2017,This app is completely useful instead of having to go on YouTube and searching for your favorite song I guarantee your favorite song will come on with Pandora,pandora
12/30/2012,This app is cool and has a good variety of music. But Palm beach tan advertises every few minutes.,pandora
1/24/2016,This app is designed for the true music lover. Works very well on Kindle Fire and is easy to set up. You program the music you want by artist and Pandora takes it from there by providing that artist as well as like-sounding artist. So you can discover other interesting artists you may not be familiar with or have heard their latest music.,pandora

12/21/2014,"This app is excellent on the kindle fire, works just like the website. My one complaint is that to skip or pause songs you have to return to the app, possibly losing your place is you are doing something else. I would give this 5 stars if I could skip/pause right from the notifications tab in the top left. This would make the app much more sleek.",pandora
3/25/2014,"This app is fairly easy to use and has quite a bit of functionality. There are so many options, I can always find something to listen to.",pandora
2/8/2013,This app is fantastic for creating custom radio stations that have great variety. We have created many custom stations to fit all of our moods and different occasions.,pandora
2/3/2014,"This app is fast, easy to use, and intuitive. The layout is very similar to that of the iOS version on the iPhone. My only issue is that when I'm out I'm more likely to have my phone on me so I use the app on my phone. When I'm at home I'm more likely to use Pandora on my computer because it's easier. So I very rarely seem to be able to find much use for Pandora on my Kindle. Additionally, my Kindle relies on wi-fi so when I'm out if I have no wi-fi access then the app is basically useless so I go back to my phone anyway. For me, personally, this app doesn't get much use on the Kindle.",pandora
8/20/2013,"This app is full of advertisements, even more than the website has. I was okayay with the ads between songs but now the app plays video ads between songs too. There's also a ad in left hand corner so whenever I like or dislike a song I am hit with another ad. All the ads I get between every song has ruined this app for me.",pandora
5/9/2014,"This app is good but I do not like the commercials that pop up while listening to your stations, but I get good music.",pandora

7/30/2014,This app is great for anyone that loves music. You get to listen to your own music and music like it. It is great for older music like Led Zeppelin or AC DC and it is great for music now a days like Marty Perry and One Direction,pandora
12/29/2011,"This app is great for discovering new music, and hearing classics that you may have forgotton about. The ads cause it to freeze up on the kindle fire though, wish they would fix that.",pandora
9/22/2012,This app is great for listening to music. Wherever you go if your getting ready its great for that too.,pandora
12/12/2012,This app is great for me because it is free and I love music so add those to together and that equals awesomeness,pandora
2/9/2013,"This app is great for people who do not have an MP3 player. This is extremely simple to use, and it is really worth buying. If you want to listen to music, you do not need internet access and you can listen to this while you are busy on your Kindle or when you are bored.",pandora
4/26/2013,"this app is great i always enjoy the songs pandora offers based on my prefrences and such, this app is epuc on every level and i highly recomend it to every one",pandora
11/16/2013,This app is great I used to use it every night but in the morning it take w or e minutes to shut it off. first you have to push the still listening then when the music starts AGAIN you have to shut off the add then you have to go to your channel. list and click the button to open the menu to shut it off. and its all deliberate so you will buy the pay service.

12/13/2012,this app is great the one problem is on the road u do not have internet so u can not listen to music otherwise it is awesome,pandora
11/20/2015,"This app is great when I want not-awful music to listen to, when I want to have control over the sort of thing I want to listen to but have no idea what it is exactly what I want.
 
 But it is terrible on the newest fire tv. It takes at least five minutes to load a song, something I thought was a fluke when I first installed it on the Fire tv but seems to be literally every time. Still works fine on my kindle and laptop and phone and that's why its still got three wtaes, but goodness it's awful on the Fire tv (which I give a resounding no-star review for). I hope that's fixed soon.",pandora

10/26/2013,"This app is great! Love the ideas it gives you for similar music and artists! Also like shuffle feature and ability
 to control which artist or genres it shuffles. Only thing that's mildly irritating is how slowly it goes back and forth
 to show you info re. artist, words to lyrics, similar artists, etc. But that could be my Kindles problem or internet
 speed. Over all I love it!",pandora
11/18/2012,"This app is great, but all of the sudden it is having technical difficulties and is hasn't let me get on in days
 Y'all need to fix it",pandora
3/22/2013,"This app is great. I have it on my Android Phone and I can't like, dislike, skip songs, or do anything without the app eventually freaking out and playing up to 4 songs at once before it finally lets me quit the app and relaunch it. But the Pandora App on my Kindle Fire HD is great. I can skip songs, like, dislike, etc. without worrying about it freaking out on me.",pandora
2/5/2014,"This app is great. I highly suggest it to anyone, but it only gives you 40 hours of music a month.
 :(",pandora
6/17/2014,"This app is GREAT. I like that it can still play while you're doing something else on your kindle, and it doesn't require me to make a new pandora account.",pandora

5/17/2013,"this app is great. it runs smoothly and is just all out awesome. I deffinitly recommend Pandora one but buy that nonlinear ratherthen on your device. it only gives you the per month payment option when the per year option is a better deal. The one thing it needs is more ways to sort stations like by genre or have a favorites bar, or playlists. that is what would make it even better then now. I hope people can understand what I'm saying. anyways, that's it!!",pandora
1/28/2012,This app is great. Such a varity of music to choose from. eventhough there are advertisements it still is great to listen to.,pandora

3/9/2012,This app is horrible I hate it. You can barely get past the front screen I'm a kid. I don't have an email!!!THE WORST,pandora

12/25/2014,"This app is HORRIBLE! It may be free but it is simply a waste of time to download. Three out of four times that I open the app it gets stuck on the main screen and I have to restart my device in hopes to make the app work. Also, many of times the app lags and/or stops working completely. Not to mention the TERRIBLE music selection. I hate this app and it is a waste of your and my time.You would be better of paying Spotify's monthly fee.",pandora
1/1/2015,This app is horrible. I cannot even get through a full song. It is really a bad experience. I have a very fast connection at all times at home and it constantly says buffering.,pandora
12/2/2013,This app is incredible!!!! You can listen to music for free you have to download it no bad reviews from me!,pandora
12/14/2011,This app is just as I titled it a very well structured app. I also like how you can create your own stations and then be able to erase it if needed. The best part of this app though is that it plays all the music you like and so far as I noticed it doesn't freeze or go blank.,pandora
2/25/2015,This app is just fine. I really don't see why people are so negative. It plays my music uninterrupted without problem. Who cares if it plays the same advertisement over and over? It isn't after every song like other reviewers said. Don't read the negative reviews. Try it for yourself.,pandora
4/1/2012,This app is just like my Andriod Phone App but I use it on my Kindle. Works great and I love it.,pandora

3/28/2013,this app is magnificent!!! you get free music plus you can create your own station to listen to. you can also rate the music if you like it. I tots reccomend this!! :),pandora
5/1/2012,this app is musical because I can choose any song I would like to choose but there is two reasons I hate about Pandora number one is that sometimes after a song goes of they have commercials and its like really and the second thing I hate about Pandora is that after you skip like six songs they tell you to stop well we don't like some of these songs but other wise that I still thank the game is musical,pandora
12/28/2012,"This app is my least favorite app. It always sends me annoying emails, even though I deleted it months ago because of them. Also, it doesn't let you access many songs. I would give it 0 stars if possible.",pandora
7/5/2012,"This app is my personal favorite, have been using it on all my devices as I get them , login is very simple, great catolo",pandora
12/25/2011,This app is not like others. It allows you to sing along with the lyrics option. In my opinion that is great.,pandora
1/6/2014,this app is not the best radio/music app out there it takes FOREVER to load then takes FOREVER to buffer!!!! unless u have a flawless Internet connection I wouldn't lookay twice at this app!,pandora
2/16/2017,This app is not what it claims to be. I put in what I liked and it gave me songs I hated. Have tried several times and it is a waste of money.,pandora
3/10/2012,This app is o.k. but the ads are so annoying.otherwise I'd give it a four.It usally plays the same songs over and over again.,pandora

4/12/2013,"This app is okay but there is a lot of ads. Sometimes you can't pick a song you like. You could get this app if you want but, this is just a warning.",pandora
12/25/2011,"This app is okayay but I don't like how you have no idea what song is going to be played next. I think that Pandora should only have the songs from an artist on their station and that's it, no random singers.",pandora
4/5/2016,"this app is one of the best
 andif I could... id listen to it so often my ears will probably burst",pandora
2/16/2014,"This app is outstanding. It is extremely well done. I can hear almost all of my favorite songs, highly recommended.",pandora

4/29/2013,"This app is perfect for when you don't have a lot of tunes stored on your device or you want to listen to something you don't have. It's a great way to discover new music based on what you already enjoy. The suggestions make sense and I'm very happy to have this. Being an avid music listener, I tend to get bored of what I have easily. Pandora has helped me find some of my new favorite artists and discover old ones I've never heard of before. Great App!",pandora

4/5/2013,This app is really cool for like parties and get togethers but most of the time when you done like a song as soon as you go to skip the song a ad pops up and you end up clicking the add and it lags your device. One thing I really like about Pandora is that when you give a song a thumbs down it says that they will never play that song again. I don't know if that's true. I really like this app you should get it,pandora
12/25/2011,This app is really cool the only thing I don't like about it is no unlimited skips and if you have say Katy Perry radio it will play some of her song but a hole bunch of other songs by other people. When I get a radio station that is who I want to listen to not other people.,pandora
11/17/2014,This app is really cool there are like a million different stations and it is a lot like I heart radio,pandora

2/2/2017,"This app is so fun! It requires internet so you can't really play it anywhere, but that's the only really I can find. It helped me find new songs that I've never heard before and surprisingly I like those songs. The music range is so wide that you can pick basically any type of music, even instrumental and foreign. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't installed this yet. You won't be disappointed!",pandora

6/8/2013,This app is so much fun. It provides me with so much music. So many options to chose from at any given time.I don't know how I used to manage listening to a Cd player back in the day! I love Pandora!,pandora
10/29/2015,this app is so off then what you type in it comes with a hole different artist for example you put mc hammer and it comes out with a artist like lil wayne and the song you type in should play the album it is in and play all of it so Pandora need a lot of work,pandora
6/3/2012,"this app is so useful and amazing it lets you listen to music you like .... its User friendly and an all around
  good time!!!!",pandora
10/29/2012,This app is terrible! It never lets me finish the songs I hear and once I put thumbs down for a song it plays it again. Not to mention all the annoying advertisements and frequent buffering...waste of time.,pandora

8/6/2012,"This app is the best for music. The options on the type of stations you want to listen to and mix them is great. Ideal for a person who likes a variety of music. Only 2 downsides is that you will be listening all day while you are supposed to be doing something else and the commercials, but it's overall fantastic.",pandora

7/25/2013,This app is to much like iHeart. if you like iHeart then you haven't heard of iHeart. not saying that this app has any supper bad issues. it still seems like a copy though. and if you like or love Pandora then you should really give iHeart a try..... :),pandora
10/30/2013,"This app is very confusing. I cant make playlists of one song, instead i have to listen to WHOLE ALBUMS. Another problem is when im listening to my favorite band, it switches to a different band for me that i probably dont want to listen to. And on top of that is the CONSTANT ADVERTISEMENTS. I know that advertising is in all apps but i DONT WANT AN ADD AFTER EVERY SINGLE SONG. Overall, one star pandora, im switching to spotify.",pandora
11/25/2012,This app is very convenient if you don't want to use up too much memory on your kindle for music.,pandora
8/9/2016,This app is very easy to use. I can receive the type of music I prefer at any time. The type of music is just endless.,pandora
6/12/2013,This app is very similar to website - log in and get your preferred stations that have been established on the website.,pandora
2/8/2013,This app is well done with millions of stations ans songs to offer the most recent station I go to myself is the Disney's Children Radio because it Has all of my songs from Disney movies and also they have some of the songs from frozen. A MUST get app for music listeners!,pandora
3/9/2013,This app is worth having. The down side is it constantly buffers throughout each song. It tends to be irritating especially with the commercials.,pandora
2/9/2014,This app isn't the greatest only points you towards different stations not a app that you can listen to a particular song. If I want to listen to a station I can turn on the radio. The search browser is crappie to. Wouldn't recommend this to friends.,pandora

5/20/2013,This app only allows you to listen to music 40 hours a month a some people like to listen to music a lot and it suck that it allows 40 hours of listening to music it makes me feel like a kid like I'm time on the amount of music I listen to,pandora
1/7/2017,This App only works half of the time. Sometimes I have to shut down my kindle just for it to work. I don't like that you only have a specific number of times that you can skip songs. That's why I rated it with three stars.,pandora
4/7/2013,This app plays a quality of the genre that you choice,pandora
10/7/2013,This app provided me with a source of peace. I just set a time limit and zone out on the sofa. I love switching in between my selected genres without having to worry about being stuck with an unpleasant song. I can either skip it or dislike it. It is also great for when I'm doing other stuff. I just turn it on and put it off to the side whilst I work. I thoroughly enjoy this app.,pandora
4/29/2015,This app provides me with an atmosphere and environment the I like. I'm able to listen to the music that I have a likening for and an able to create personal stations,pandora

5/10/2012,"This app seems to limit my choices of music while still feeding duplicate commercials. If I had be able to switch stations with more ease, I might have enjoyed it better.",pandora
7/26/2012,this app shows sooty of music. even though you don't always get the artist or song you want its still great!!!!,pandora
3/21/2013,"This app sounds great, but I don't really use it much since I have the Sirius/XM app installed. I would use it more if I didn't have a pay service, but there are a couple of things I am not crazy about: 1) Ads, but nothing you can do about that; and 2) when I select an artist to start with, it seems they don't play very much from that artist, and the number of other artists they play is very limited. For example, I ask for a station to begin with Rush, and I'll hear a Rush song to start with, but not again for 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, I'll hear a couple of songs from Led Zeppelin, a couple from the Rolling Stones, and maybe 2 or 3 more artists, and no others. So maybe this app is not for me.",pandora
2/16/2012,This app started out working as expected. After a short time it suddenly would not shut down. No matter what I tried it would not stop playing. I finally managed to reach the Kindle home page and remove it from the device. It was the only way it would shut off. I don't really trust it enough to reload it.,pandora
12/29/2013,This app sucked!!! Could not get it to open. Glad it was free so I didn't waste any money. Will stick to I heart radio!!!,pandora
1/3/2014,this app sucks u have to put in your date of birth your zip code you have to tell them if your a boy or girl and tell them your email and more its retarded,pandora

8/27/2012,"This app thinks it's the only thing running on your Fire. I find the controls, irritating and trying to turn it off is a nightmare.",pandora
6/3/2014,"This app use to be a really good app, and I loved it! But now it doesn't want to open. I tried to open it, and it would just stay on the Pandora page and wouldn't open. It would just shut down, I don't know why and its making me angry. Someone tell me why it isn't working! I have to keep downloading it over and over again and its getting annoying.",pandora
2/2/2014,"This app used to be better , meaning more music less ads but after a revamp has now more ads than you care for but still come back time and time again for . The selection of available artists and other tuning / set up features with in PANDORA are amazing and what truly makes it a lil' better than most of it's competitors .",pandora
10/7/2013,"This app used to be good but lately, its been pretty annoying; running in the background eating up my data plan ehrn I thought it was shut down. Plays the same 5 songs in a row on my phone but when I listen yo the same station on my pc, now all these different better songs play. I don't mind the commercials but if I can't get it to shut off when I close the app w/o the need to force close, I might have to let it go.",pandora

 UPDATE 10/20/14: Ads have become progressively more obnoxious and intrusive. Today I had one lock up the entire Kindle - I couldn't even power it down. One star - unacceptable. Tried to uninstall and even that failed.",pandora
6/22/2016,"This app was a breeze to download and the ""stations"" are easy to arrange. The only thing I don't care for are the ads, but they are few and far between, and I expected there would be ads, anyway, considering this is a free app. I would highly recommend Pandora!",pandora
9/23/2013,"This app was an amazing adaptation of the web based Pandora. It was simple to set up and use and played a lot of good songs. The problem came when I logged out of it one night to charge my Kindle, (it drains your battery very quickly and won't charge at all even when no music is actually playing), and I couldn't log in the next day. When I click on the Icon, the title screen comes up, but it won't load pass that stage. I tried deleting it and downloading the app again but nothing will fix it! I hope I'm the only one that has this problem because it is really a great thing, but I just wanted to warn the next person who gets this that this problem might happen to them.",pandora

 monthly rate or by the year.",pandora

8/19/2013,this is a good app because if you want to listen to music on the radio than here you go. if you know a song but cant remember the name of it it tells you and you can write it down like I do.when I couldn't remember a song I ask my cousin and she told me the name of the band but not the song. so now I get the band and the song.well I hope you lin it and remember if I reviewed it it means it good.bye y'all.,pandora

3/9/2015,"this is a good app. it is free, it has a lot of songs, and it is easy to use. Pandora has a lot of songs and genres, too.
  this app only has a few downsides, it can only skip 6 times per hour per station, and when you thumbs down a song, a song by the same person plays. that part is slightly annoying.
  some people want this app to upgrade, which makes sense. it has a few flaws. But some people don't know that there is already an upgrade for it. it is called Pandora One. it has more songs, genres, and handles skipping and ""artists that you don't like"" very well. this costs $40 a year, but you can have it with all of your devices. you sign in to Pandora with your email, so as long as you you use the same email for all of your devices, you can have Pandora one on all of them. I hope this helps anyone who likes Pandora.
  I trust Pandora more than any other radio app. this is because most songs are clean, espicaly if you are searching the right songs/music. thank you for your time.",pandora

I want to check out the songs and artists that I bookaymarked but sadly I can't. Please Pandora fix this issue on your app in order to make this app great again.,pandora

5/13/2012,This is a great app but could do with less advertisements. I hate that almost every time I try to skip a song I have to deal with an ad,pandora
3/6/2013,this is a great app but there are to many breaks from the muisc and I think we should be albe. to skip as much song as we want but other then that it is a great app.,pandora

10/14/2012,"This is a great app if you want to discover new bands. It has a radio system for bands and genres. Each station has about five bands that are similar to the main band on that station. It mixes songs from those bands in with the band you know, so you hear songs that you might like. This app helped me discover 5 new bands that I really like. The major problem I seem to have is that even if a band has 6 albums, I constantly plays the same 10-15 songs. This really annoys me because if I lookay on youtube for songs from said band, I see all these songs I never knew existed and I very well might like better than what i hear on pandora. I know pandora has them in their library because if I lookay at the album information, I can get 30 second samples of songs. It doesn't seem that hard to just randomly pick any of the 50 songs that a band might have.",pandora
11/20/2013,"This is a great app in terms of the vast amount of great music of all types, although it lacks regular updates that come on iOS. If this app would regularly update I would not even be writing this review. The old version of this software (the version that is being used on Amazon) is not a perfect answer for your music, but it is as good as it gets. Amazon charges a seller fee for every sale and I believe that is the reason that Pandora does not give regular updates on kindle; they can get such a greater profit on iTunes and Google store. It is not Pandora that is doing a bad job; it is Amazon that is not allowing its customers to get regular! updates just for the small effects amount of money they get from it. Come on Amazon",pandora

7/17/2016,"This is a great application made for those that already use Pandora radio. It is perfectly integrated with their online system already set-up, so if you are plugged in online in a browser this application works great.
 
 Problems you'll find if you use the free version of Pandora:
 -The advertisements frequently pop up into a large portion of the screen and are hard to close but easy to open.
 -You cannot alter much of the information about a particular radio station (where music comes from such as artists, songs, e.g.)
 *EDIT*
 -It is not possible to get a scrolling list of previously played music. You can only view the one you are listening to at the moment.

3/17/2013,This is an awesome App to purchase if you are lookaying for a music App that learns as you check whether you like the song it plays at the time. You can create individual band name folders and click thumbs up or thumbs down to make your selection for that individual band you have named each folder you are listening to. It learns as you make your selections and narrows the music it plays until it eventually plays nothing but the band name you picked for each folder.

5/20/2014,"This is an awesome application as everyone knows. It works but too many apps. So if you got 5$ a month to pay for add-free music go ahead. The only bad thing about this service is the limit of it's music. It only has only 1 million songs. (It's true; search it up.) Meaning that after a while of listening to a station for so long you start noticing the same songs coming on. Easy product but it's limited.
 This is why I use Spotify. Spotify has 20 million songs. So pay 5 dollars for music that you can't really lookay for specifically or pay 10 dollars a month for no adds unlimited listening and search and play exact songs. Now I just sound like a Spotify employee lmao. Anywho, Spotify is better.",pandora

 I've been using Pandora daily and what's great about the mobile app (as opposed to the desktop version) is that there's no break in the playlist. Sure, you have advertisements that pop up every few minutes but that's a small price to pay. Everything else is great, great selection and ever-increasing song list and the ability to switch channels when I want to hear something else. I don't particularly like ""mixing"" radio stations but that my preference and I can control that.
 
 Pandora radio for mobile. 5 stars.",pandora

Type the name of any band in, and you can listen to that band and other bands like the band you typed in. If you listen to ICP expect to hear Boondox, Twiztid, Cypress Hill, and much more. For another instant if you listen to The Beatles, expect to get Beach Boys, the Byrds, Dave clarck 5 and many more 60's bands. Last example is Queen.

1/2/2013,"This music streaming service like many others has forgotten about Canada. Or they just don't care about Canada because ""the market isn't big enough""",pandora
12/28/2012,This music system is far better than loading CD's and changing them out. I play this for hours when I am home during the day and now have a connection on my phone so I can play it in my car. Very few commercials so I have not paid for a subscription.,pandora

5/4/2012,"This really came in handy since the radio in my car stopped working, like the selections as well. Thanks Pandora",pandora
3/2/2015,"This review is not about the quality of the music or the ads. i spend long hours on the computer and i like to have some nice background music. My dogs like having it as well.
 
 I connect it to my stereo for a quick streaming experience. I used to play it on my iPhone, but then used my fire so i won't need to disconnect every time i got a phone call.
 
 The main problem is that the app will stop playing when there is a Ad. This happens less frwequently with PandoraOne, but still happens each 30 - 40 minutes. A hassle since i need to turn off the app and then re-launch it.
 
 Not sure why this still not fixed.",pandora

12/15/2012,"This service has been able to do what I have always wanted to do with music; create and play dynamic playlists. The parameters that they assign music allows users to create stations and focus the dynamics of the playlist as one listens. It can focus to a such a fine degree to where I have to delete stations and re-create them just to expand the music content. I run this on PC's, media players and tablets. My music collection has been off loaded. The subscription cost is very reasonable and makes the music seamless for hours.",pandora
10/4/2012,"This service is wonderful, I have found many small circulation songs that I never would have guessed would be on their list.",pandora
11/7/2012,This service replaces my XM radio. Preferring to go ad less I have tried the 1 month free trial and will continue based on my experience so far . I have created my own stations and tuned in the stations created by genre. These have been very satisfactory. Even paying for premium service it is less than Xm.,pandora
5/2/2012,"This service rocks, and it is free. Sure, you get some commercials here and there but it's free. If that drives you crazy it is cheap to get them removed. I have tried other music apps and always come back to Pandora.",pandora
3/16/2014,"This service was recommended by an employee at Radio Shack. I was searching for smooth jazz for my hospitalized sister. I loaded Pandora Media on my Kindle, and the service offered the smooth jazz genre, Just what I needed. I would recommend this service to anyone that enjoys music on the go, or at home. It is free, and the adds can be eliminated for a small amount each month. I do appreciate the tip from the Radio Shack employee. Much appreciated.",pandora
1/1/2014,This should be on every portable device that has internet access.,pandora
9/25/2015,This showed as a purchase in my account and I did not purchase it. I now have to jump through more security hoops to secure my account though I THOUGH I had a pretty secure password.,pandora
6/8/2015,"This site enables you to pick that one singer that you want to hear more of and create your station, voila, there you are, hearing your favorite singer, you can create as many stations you want, I have 7!!",pandora
6/12/2017,This site has a very good selection of music. This site is very easy to use. the commericals every once in a while are not bad.,pandora
11/13/2016,"This site would be so much better if it didn't have so much buffering, signal drops. Once tou make a request for songs or artist to play or not, There's no recognition, songs repeat and plays anyway what it wants. This annoying, and makes me not want to listen and cut it off.",pandora
3/16/2013,"This starting out being 5 stars. However I gave it 2 stars because of the mandatory ""write a review"" section.",pandora
2/26/2012,This station is just awesome. It plays music almost nonestop. The advertisements are very just very short onset. It does not matter if you listen to it in the car or at home or wherever you are I just can't get. enough.,pandora
11/26/2014,This station is very easy to access and allows you to here a variety of different songs. One area I think this sight would benefit from. If people were allowed to pay to download by the song also select a specific song by an artist to listen too.,pandora
9/24/2012,This streaming station is great for finding music you like. The kids like it to when searching for disney music.,pandora
12/20/2011,this sucks because it wouldn't swirl when I was trying to enter my date of birth and password. it sucks,pandora

6/25/2015,This system just won't go away. Needs to be more user friendly. Music starts playing in my pocket now and then. Very annoying.,pandora
8/10/2015,This tablet is being changed to block my ability to access websites I prefer. I find your Pandora app to inferior to access Pandora radio as I do on my computer. I much more prefer to avoid your app and deal directly with Pandora. I was able to do so without android download. Why do I need to go thru amazon now when I have avoided in the past? Amazon should leave well enough alone.,pandora

8/19/2013,This to me is the best music media on the internet.,pandora
2/14/2015,"This totally stinks, never got the app on my phone when I received it, what was the point in asking if I wanted it, Don't understand you guys!!",pandora
8/17/2017,this version always wants to update over my market version. amazon version has two times the ads do not install the amazon market version.,pandora
1/25/2013,this version of Pandora is better than my android phones Pandora app.,pandora
1/24/2012,This version of Pandora is really different. The music stops playing after two songs because it wants to see if I'm still listening; and my favorite stations are hard to get to now. They should have left it the way it was.,pandora

12/10/2013,This was a reasonable purchase. The product did not performed as described even if the price was adequate. I don't recommend the purchase. Pandora forces you to listen to music you don't to hear.,pandora
6/1/2014,This was an app I needed to download for my daughter on her tablet. She has found use for it. Thanks.,pandora
2/7/2014,This was clicked accidentally and now I am stuck with it on the carousel! Too easy to do---watch what you click when adding apps.,pandora
2/2/2016,This was complicated to get to work on the kindle. You have to install and uninstall for whatever reason to get it to play.,pandora
11/28/2011,This was great until they added commercials.,pandora
3/19/2016,This was my 1st app on my new KFHD & I love it. The device has good speakers & w/Pandora you can program your favorites. Wish there were no audio ads but the app was free so why complain?! I had to go to Amazon's Kindle support to figure out where it was on my KFHD once I downloaded it but that's not the fault of the app. Pleased to have it & esp at no cost.,pandora
12/31/2014,"This was my favorite app until the latest update. Now it won't even start on my Kindle and if it does, it locks up after just a few songs or if I change the channel. I am a paying customer and deserve to have what I pay for. Can't even figure out how to stop my subscription.",pandora

Pandora is my favorite music app. No matter what kind of music you like or what mood you are in, you are sure to find music that you love! I love that you can customize your music listening to your liking. I like all kinds of music from James Taylor to Metallica to Bruno Mars and with Pandora, I can set it up to listen to whatever I am feeling that day! I highly recommend this for your music app!",pandora

1/17/2013,This works great on my mini tablet. It gives better volume than any of my other aps. But I would like to skip more songs.,pandora
10/25/2015,"This works just the same as the desktop version but if I had to give it a negative mark, it would be that it seems to go to commercial a lot sooner than it does on the desktop version.",pandora
12/26/2012,"This works like crap on my kindle fire, it doesn't always load and when it does it freezes all the time. So snnoying",pandora
1/29/2014,This would be a good app but there is to many ads and doesn't focus mainly on the artist of the station,pandora
1/1/2014,This would be an excellent app except for the fact that every other time I start it or it gets an update it stops playing any music at all. Song titles and info appear for the expected duration of the track but no sound is played and there isn't even an animation to indicate that something might be trying to play. When the next update arrives it functions normally again. Until the next time. Very frustrating.,pandora
7/16/2014,"This year I couldn't find any station on regular AM/FM radio that was playing Christmas songs. I went to Pandora, and downloaded a classic Christmas program, and listened to my heart's content. That's the great thing about Pandora, whatever you want, they have it.",pandora

7/10/2013,Thought the I would give this app a try and I found it very easy to manuver. Would recommend for any one that wants to listen to a variety of music.,pandora

"" Too complicated"" I said. Was I wrong? YES! Now I would be miserable without it! You can teach an old dog, new tricks!
 
  Thanks, Shelia",pandora

7/19/2017,Title is self explanatory .,pandora
7/23/2012,"Title says it all, even since I listened the 1st time I've liked the product, good times with fun music",pandora
3/18/2016,Title says it all. Especially if your car links to Pandora. Lets you set up your channels from your favorite song and projects what you like from a single song. Like Tivo for the radio.,pandora
12/30/2012,To be able to choose any artists/comedians I like to listen to for FREE is just amazing!!! Highly recommended for quality listening,pandora
1/4/2013,To be able to listen to music and over time tailor it to your liking. It also has incredible diversity of selection. There are ads but they are reasonable and not to long.,pandora

1/9/2014,"to be honest, I don't even want to give this app one star!! Pandora used to be my favorite music app but now you only get a few hours to listen to music!!! Also if you use your 6 skips, its for every single station!! whenever I used my skips I would just go to another station and be fine.... now I cant!!! I thought an update was supposed to good, my review might say 1 star but I say ZERO",pandora
2/9/2014,"To be honest, I dropped this before actually trying on my new tablet. I've had a good experience using it on a friends tv quite a while ago, but the requirements from the company now...! Unbelievable what they require.",pandora

7/18/2017,Unfortunately not a lot of time to just sit and listen as of yet. Company from out of state arrived so that meant trips that tookay me away from totally listening to music and actually getting all of my likes and dislikes registered. I hope to have time very soon to enjoy all that Pandora will provide. Had just enough time to know I will really enjoy it and I am really lookaying forward to having more listening time now that company has departed. I am sorry to not really being ready to give a comprehensive review yet.,pandora

3/2/2016,"Update: I canceled my Pandora subscription after they raised the price. Just not worth it to me anymore... Too expensive to get rid of the ads... I'd rather just listen to the free version and deal with the ads.
 
 Former: I listen to Pandora every day. In the car, at the office, at the gym... There is simply no other way to get this much music for so little money. I force close every once in a while when I undock from the car or change power sources. Otherwise it's perfect.",pandora

 Now it is crap. It will play one song, maybe two, then three to four ads. In a 30 minute time frame I'm hearing more ads then music.
 It has a ""Why ads"" option, which just tells you to upgrade. Nope, not upgrading, I'm just going to find another option.",pandora

2/19/2015,"Used this app for years, and I'm sick of telling it to skip tracks all the time. I'm tired of it trying to play genres of music that absolutely don't belong in the channels I create. Overpriced app that tends to play music you don't like. Play quality is good.",pandora
10/20/2011,"Used to be awesome, now just like listening radio, unless you pay.",pandora
12/5/2014,Used to be better before all the commercials and it times out way too quickly now. Thanks for selling out Pandora.,pandora
10/12/2017,used to be good new update now its much better. on screen volume easier navigation more features. over all kudos to pandora,pandora
7/29/2017,"Used to be good, but has evolved to play too many ads, ads are too loud, ads take up most of the screen. Would buy an ad-less app, but they don't sell one; they sell a monthly ad-less subscription. LAME!",pandora
9/7/2012,"Used to be great, but the ad's ruined the experience a bit.",pandora
9/24/2012,"Used to be great, now more commercials than music. Also has a disturbing tendency to just stop working. Lastly, when used on my Android it states that it requires the installation of Amazon Appstore (yet it doesn't need it to run?!).",pandora
2/12/2016,"Used to be great, now they are the worset, better products on themarket and they work and free.",pandora
10/20/2017,"Used to be my favorite music app but hadn't been working properly recently, smh...",pandora
10/13/2015,"Used to be okay, but now is loaded with ads you have to watch or listen too and limitations , they try to force you to subscribe at $5 a month. No thanks, Removed.",pandora
2/14/2015,"Used to be the shizzle for the phone. Now they have so many ads streaming through that it will actually slow down and interrupt the song stream. WTF? And to boot, they're now asking you pay after 40 hrs every month. I used to play it in the car, at work, bike riding, etc. 40 hrs is a few days for me.
 
 As far as the mobile app goes, screw Pandora with their 40 hr limit and endless ads. You have far too much competition for this crap!
 
 Now, for the pc review. On the pc you don't experience the above issues however, there's still a lot of ads. UNLESS . . . you know a trick, like I do. And yes, it's completely legal.
 
 For your home pc, Google ""Adam Haile Elpis"". Click on the first hit. Here, you can download Elpis which, is a free desktop client for Pandora. In other words, it is a program designed to play Pandora. Nifty thing is that it does two amazing things. 1- it allows you to have unlimited skips. 2- it will not download any ads. In other words, it simulates the pay service.
 
 YOU'RE WELCOME!!!",pandora
12/1/2012,Used to love this app. Yes I get the fact that it is free but can't listen to a complete song and ads are repeated over and over. I know they have more than one sponsor. Reminds me if mtv. Music television with no music. Moving to slackers. Not as great as Pandora was but better than what it has become.,pandora
3/17/2013,used to pay liked it a lot. money got tight drop it to free WOW so many commercials. was gifted a fire tablet get amazon free music NO commercials love!!!,pandora
12/18/2012,"Used to work great, then stopped. I updated hoping it would fix it but made it worse. It used to begin playing eventually after a few times of exiting and restarting program. Now, it usually won't. Also, I play lullabies for my baby (when it works) and before the update there were rarely commercials. Now loud, multiple ones play at random, which is fine when she is awake, sucks when she just dozed off.",pandora
1/6/2017,"Used to work, used it all the time, then it was updated and brokayen. Lame.",pandora
11/19/2013,"Used to work. Now it won't load a single song on WiFi or LTE. I WAS a pandora one subscriber. No longer and never again will I pay for this terrible service. Also it plays the same songs OVER and OVER. I can't even reccomend the free app because it is so full of advertisements. Amazon music, spotify, Sony music unlimited, and Google's music service are all much better. Amazon music is probably the best.",pandora

12/14/2016,"VERY nice! I am very pleased with how Pandora lookays and performs on Kindle Fire. The only issue is that about half the time when I turn it on, it quickly shuts back off and I have to restart it (then it stays on), but I don't find that too be a huge issue. It is more pleasing to use and lookay at on my Kindle than it is on my PC. I really like it.",pandora

12/31/2016,Want a free music app that plays your favorite artists and songs? Pandora is great for you. One catch.... you need wifi like most other apps.,pandora
12/20/2014,"Wanted an easy way to get to music, other than what I downloaded. Pandora is the easiest way to find your music, and set channels with the type of music you like, always at your finger tips to listen to. I do recommend this app.",pandora

1/24/2017,"Was a huge fan of Pandora for years - decent price, easy to navigate on screen, good music selections, many positives. But then something bad happened when they likely brought in some kids fresh outta college who decided to dumb it all down by make the computer screen huge with all items spread out towards all edges of your computer screen vs. original Pandora where it was all centered pretty much in the center. Now one has to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function buttons. Plus for this downgrade in features and functions, they started charging more money per month. Plus there IS NO WHERE you can call, talk or email them about your complaints of concerns. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenues anywhere, whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel - NO REFUNDS - you just have to wait till your subscription runs out. So they recently changed it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customers. Maybe it's okay for your cell phone, but on a standing office or home PC there are much better options out there - I've switched to Amazon Music.",pandora
2/5/2014,was a little annioning around Christmas they didn't seem to want to play anything except christmas music?,pandora
8/15/2017,"Was able to enjoy a mixture of music & even a Christmas song came on, which was nice for Valentine's Day...",pandora
1/22/2015,"Was better without commercials, sell out...",pandora
2/16/2016,"was fine when first installed. When I travelled, it stopped working outside US when I was at Wifi Spots. All kinds of legal text and apologies pop up. I went for Songza as alternative after that. Less hassle no subscription.",pandora

5/2/2013,"Was unaware I had even started a week-long trial, 3 month later I notice that my card is being charged monthly yet I hadn't used Pandora at all during that time period. I reached out to Pandora and they told me they wouldn't refund any of the charges because of their Terms and Conditions. Left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Not going to use Pandora when I can use Soundcloud instead.",pandora

2/23/2017,"Way better than I heart, free, and 5 star! What more can you possibly ask for? Pandora is obviously better I <3 doesn't let you add genres to the same station, and let you have more than one. It only does one of those.",pandora
10/6/2013,Way better than iHeartradio!,pandora

8/27/2014,Way to many ads,pandora

1/5/2016,way too many adds; 1 song followed by 3 adds then repeat the fm radio has less ads.,pandora
12/2/2014,way too many ads,pandora
9/14/2014,Way too many ad's and didn't have some stations I was lookaying for. Spotify is way better they have less ad's and more music,pandora
2/8/2016,Way too many ads and takes up a ton of data... download the songs and save them on your phone and play them from a media player instead,pandora
12/13/2014,Way too many ads. Like 2 or 3 in a row without music in between. And a lot of the songs sound nothing like the related station they're on. So I'm not sure how they select those. Overall I prefer YouTube.,pandora
9/2/2016,"way too many ads.
 Bookaymarking is useless. when you bookaymark a song you then only get a few seconds of the song when you go back to it.",pandora
2/27/2016,Way too many commercials and auto fed songs not related to my specific artist.,pandora

I'll put it on the nearest sound system quite frequently, and the most recent download, the one for my Samsung Galaxy IV lets me plug into the radio on my truck and play quite good audio on the go. So far, this has not made a big dent in my monthly allotment of gigabytes of download over Verizon, in part because most of the time I use it on devices attached to my home network either via Ethernet or wirelessly that are served by high speed cable based internet service.",pandora

My son gave me a gift card and it isn't working. I've written so many times and on one will help me. The free version sucks (ads) so you really need to pay for it. I think if you buy it from Amazon it'll be better than buying it from Pandora directly. Amazon takes care of their customers but Pandora doesn't.

I have a station by an artist so I expect mostly their music but that doesn't happen.it isn't all that bad sometimes it makes me enjoy new music. And it really needs a DO NOT PLAY THIS BUTTON for Rihanna don't Hate me I don't really like it anymore.AGAIN I LOVE THIS APP ESPECIALLY THAT IT STOPS PLAYING AFTER WHO KNOWES WHEN DURING MY SLEEP B),pandora
2/10/2012,Well I think it's okayay but it has a lot of glitches but on the other side it works fine some of the people are rude and weird.,pandora

 it has a great station search but it needs to be worked on its loading skills",pandora

3/27/2016,well just comparing it to iheartradio app i find it much better to use. the only draw back is that sometimes songs will be overplayed,pandora
5/29/2014,Well organized listening in my favored genres. Exposes me to new music that I might not have found on my own.,pandora
12/31/2012,Well sometimes it'll glitch. But I love it! You can type in any Singer and add it to your station which is pretty cool. But it also gives you stations you mite like.,pandora
1/3/2014,Well when I was trying to listen to Taylor swift I always got other country music and may be just maybe would I get 2 of her songs a day,pandora
1/1/2017,Well worth the Amazon Prime price of FREE TIME!!!,pandora
12/7/2014,Well you can hear the music fine but what I don't like is that I can't search a song for it to play. It also needs to have a loop button so you can listen to a song more than once.,pandora
10/24/2014,well you see Pandora is a great radio its just that there is commercials which I don't want to listen to and when you try tonpick the songs some thing else comes up another song that u didn't want!! but other wise I really like it so I'm gonna give it three stars,pandora
5/24/2014,"well, its amazing but sometimes it doesn't give u the exact singer u wanna listen to and it goes to commercials every four songs",pandora
6/21/2012,"Well, the music is great. There aren't too many commercials and they always seem to play other artists that I like!",pandora

9/20/2016,"What a great app! I listen to it at work and in the car and they always have great music. I will probably drop my
 XM and just use this.",pandora
8/12/2013,"What a great service. I think they have just raised their price, but it still worth it. Make sure to turn your receiving device off if you are not listening because Pandora gets charged even though you are not hearing the music. We made this mistake to begin with our radio playing thru the stereo system. We just turned off the stereo but the streaming continued for many hours. Sorry about that Pandora we watch it now.",pandora
3/28/2013,What a great way to be able to listen to my favorite music...of all varieties! I am truly enjoying it!,pandora

12/28/2012,What a great way to listen to the music that makes you feel good. Very easy to customize what you listen to. We'll worth the four bucks a month to hear uninterupted music.,pandora
1/8/2015,"What a great website, I truly enjoy visiting it several times per week, thanks.",pandora
11/3/2013,"What a pain in the butt. You get some type of advert almost any time you perform an action. For example, you click to view an artists details, you go back to the song, there is an ad. The ad sizes vary in size and the 'x' to close them out is very tiny so what happens is you go to close an ad, for the fifth time in one track, and you end up launching the browser and getting hit with the ad. Screw it, I will keep forking over the cash for rhapsody.
 
 Adding to the review. These ads are worse than a porn site.",pandora
9/8/2014,"What a perfect site for music, I cant find anything better, use it everywhere, sound is incredible, run through to car radio excellent",pandora

3/4/2016,What are we without the sound of music. This application is a very important part of my digital life. Thanks,pandora
2/26/2014,"What can a person say about a music service that customizes one's listening taste into an intuitive music playback service? It's great and worth having, unless you're someone who likes to play the same personal collection of mp3's over and over again. Pandora allows its fans to add variety by accepting or rejecting tunes according to one's taste in music. In the end, you get a music channel personalized to YOU! How good is that!?",pandora
12/28/2013,"What can I say about Pandora other than it is fabulous! First of all, spend the money and upgrade your membership to Premium and get the CD quality and no ads. While I do not get to play exactly what selection I want from an artist, I can select that artist. I find that I like my CDs better when I want to listen to a particular album but this sure beats satellite and fm.",pandora
3/29/2013,"What can I say about Pandora. It's always been fair about paid and free subscriptions. The free version is a great marketing tactic. It keeps the name brand up and for those that pay like I have in the past, it's awesome with awesome features. I'm currently running the free one again due to finances but I still enjoy the great service Pandora has to offer.",pandora

3/30/2015,What can I say that has not been said. Great app that has the ability to learn my preferences and recommend perfect solutions.,pandora
1/30/2014,What can I say this app rocks. No pun intended. Pandora has the capability to understand your music choices and with that they get your music preferences down and provide music that you will enjoy.,pandora

1/17/2015,What can I say. It's an app. It works. It's Pandora. If you have all that what more can you ask for?,pandora
11/24/2012,What can I say. Works flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD. The sound is great. The artist and songs are all similar to what I've chosen and there are not many ads. A great app.,pandora

3/23/2013,"What can you say about an app such as this, either it works well or its a waste of time and money, this app works well for me.",pandora
2/12/2013,"What could be better than my own personal radio station? Now I can listen to country, rap , R& B, etc. when I want. I happened to to like that it plays similar new songs to the ones I like.So I am not just hearing the same songs that I like but up and coming artsists in the same genre. Very few commericials but, no tacky Djs. Pretty great. I can even stream over my blue ray.",pandora
1/7/2014,"What could be better? You can have it on multiple devices where ever you go. My favorite thing about it is that if you enter a statement nag or group, it can introduce you to new music.",pandora
6/11/2012,"What could be wrong with Pandora? Easy to use, almost commercial free, all music you choose, all the time! Enable your bluetooth and off you go!",pandora
7/26/2016,What could be your next project is to search device music so it can search the artists and stop removing the stations. I can't find certain stations for some artists I have on my phone.,pandora
9/14/2013,"What did we do before Pandora?! I can choose a music genre a listen to ad free music. I often find music that I had not heard before that quickly become one of my favorites. And I can listen to this great music while working on my laptop, tablet or stream it through our TV. What's not to like?! Thank you, Pandora!",pandora
12/15/2013,"What else can anyone say about Pandora, It's simply the best app to hear your favorite songs and customize your listening experience. Just get it!",pandora
6/18/2015,What else could you ask for! Easy to like something you might not have heard on traditional radio.I used to listen all the time when I was at work. Now that I am retired I listen on my computer or e-reader if I am outside!,pandora
12/11/2013,What else is there to say. I love Pandora.,pandora
2/1/2013,"What happened to Pandora?? I'm just cruising along with life when all of a sudden I realize how times have changed and Spotify seems bigger in the market than Pandora. I feel like I just got old at the thought of how things have changed.
 
 But, this app holds up respectably in terms of ease of use and ability to stream music without lag. I admit I have become more of a Spotify user myself, but for old times' sake, Pandora is just as great of a music streaming service. The app performs decently as well.",pandora
9/3/2014,What happened? Use to be good,pandora
9/7/2014,"What I have experienced so far is very good but I don't have a lot of time for it yet. So, I'll have to reserve more comments to a later review. Thank You.",pandora
3/12/2016,what I heard of it was fine I haven't had much time in the last to days to really take time to listen to it.,pandora
1/11/2013,"What I highly dislike is having to say ""still listening"". You would think that after paying for 1yr. subscription not only eliminating the commercial you would get at least 8-10 hrs of listening time instead of a couple hrs. Really gets irritating to constantly having to do that. Also every once in awhile I can hear 2 stations playing at the same time so I have to shut down my device & restart.",pandora
1/12/2014,What I like about Pandora you can store different types of music. It's is easy to access and listen while on the web.,pandora
6/8/2013,What I like when I want it! It doesn't get any better than this!,pandora
3/26/2013,"What I love about Pandora is being exposed to artists and genres that heretofore I was not aware of, then being inspired to buy artists' recordings. No commercials, just good, solid music. Interested in Brazilian? Zydeco? Salsa? Top 40? Sinatra and the Rat Pack? Karmin and more? Even little-known artists are on here (Lee PressOn and the Nails for one). Give your ear a treat!",pandora
5/31/2017,"What I want to hear, where I want to hear it and when I want to hear it. Good job Pandora.",pandora
1/9/2013,"What I want, When I want. No drive space required.Can use it on any device any time any where. Great.",pandora
9/18/2014,What is error code 3002?.,pandora
10/30/2013,What is not good about Pandora Media. all kinds of music you could possibly find. i like Pandora Media for reals,pandora
11/18/2015,What is not to like,pandora
4/30/2013,"What is not to like if you can listen to your favorite type of music. Wish they could give you more free time on your kindles. 40 hours just not enough and can't justify the extra cost for more, when listening to radio is free.",pandora
3/29/2016,"What is not to like? Great music for free! I can live with the commercials, even though there seem to be more of them these days.",pandora
5/22/2013,what is not to love about Pandora? It provides me hours of great listening time with a wide variety of musical choices!,pandora
10/24/2016,What is not to love? Lots of stations and you can find anything you want to listen to. I like to listen when I am feeling bored with my iPod.,pandora
1/19/2013,What is that? I have all to use this app and it's not eligible for my country. Let me understand please,pandora
4/16/2013,what is there to say about Pandora and not the one with the big blue people. almost anything you want to hear is on Pandora radio. only problem on the Kindle Fire HD is you have to have a wifi signal. but great none the less.Like it over Iheart radio.,pandora
9/2/2016,What mobile music is all about. The greatest music app of all time. I just love that I can have my own music stations at a drop of a hat.,pandora

2/25/2015,"What more needs to be said that it's a great product and its free. Perfect for all who love to listen to music.
 Thumbs up",pandora
10/12/2014,"what not to love, i get all kind of music for free, sound quality is good and it is FREE",pandora
3/30/2013,What one gets is fine but never changes. Need is for greater variety of available artists and titles. Recommend revised list of artists and titles every two months.,pandora
5/28/2013,"What sets Pandora apart is the ability to insert other groups or styles of music into a pre-set channel. You can essentially create your own preferred variety in the music, mixing and matching groups as you see fit to keep your ears happy. Lots of programs can play one group over and over. Few mix solely at the discretion of the user and do it as seamlessly as Pandora.",pandora
6/26/2013,What was once a great app starts to spiral downwards. The same music gets played again after an hour or 2. No variety in music anymore. When kindle screen goes dark the music stops. This has not happened before but now happens very frequently. Kindle needs to be on at all times for the app to play music.,pandora
7/13/2013,"What would I be without it? Bored. Pandora is the ticket.I can not live without it now. UH HUH.

9/11/2014,"Whatever you want to hear, Pandora has it and will play it for you for free. You choose your stations, you create as many stations as you want and it all waits for your next listening session or mood or activity. With thumb up and thumb down option, you can eventually have a huge playlist of favorites only. Pandora is great.",pandora
1/28/2014,"Whatever your taste, Pandora has got it. Furthermore, Pandora often plays other musicians of the same genre as what you select, thereby broadening your musical horizon.",pandora
5/2/2014,What's going on with Pandora upgrades? Where is the OFF button for when I'm done listening on my phone.,pandora
7/22/2015,"What's not to like about Pandora, it is like being your own DJ for as long as you use it, and the fact that you can save many different playlists allows you to choose the mood you want.",pandora

10/28/2014,what's not to like?! :),pandora
7/14/2016,Whats not to love about Pandora? ... except for maybe the lack of variety in the commercials. Having this app on my Kindle is extra wonderful.,pandora
12/23/2015,"What's not to love about Pandora? Free music of my choice, artists of my choice, and the option to shuffle music for hours on end. Sure there are the occasional commercials, but they can easily be tuned out just like tv commercials. I really wish I could get Pandora on my home stereo system, and also would like to get it in my vehicle, but I do not own a cell phone. LOVE< LOVE Pandora",pandora

9/18/2016,What's there not to like about Pandora - love love love it - have it on all of my devices!,pandora
10/5/2013,What's to say. I love blues and jazz.,pandora
12/19/2012,What's to say. It works awesome. On my echo there is no commercials.,pandora
5/1/2017,What's with all the steps to listen to the music? Before it was one quick step. Now it's like I have to sign up every time I want to listen. Sometimes that's too hard to do while I'm driving. HATE IT!!,pandora
7/19/2017,"When a friend sends me a Pandora song he likes, when I click on it I get something similar, but not the song I want to hear. I don't need Pandora to ""broaden my horizons"", I want to hear the song my friend sent me.....",pandora

2/21/2013,"when first started using it, it was good, but the second time it was having problems. When I tried to open it I would just get stuck on the blue Pandora screen, so I reinstalled it only to get another problem.

Then after about three months it came up with a update that required you to have sign in. I tried it, it worked, I got in and was happy. Then the next day I tried to sign in with the same password and sign in but it said there was a sign in all ready existing to that password.",pandora
4/23/2012,When I first got this app it was the best thing that ever happened to me. After a few months it stoped working so I unistalled it.

I am sad that pandora and I have such an on again off again relationship. :(,pandora

8/6/2012,"When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer of 3.99 per month. All went well until my bank decided to change my debit/credit card due to hacking of local stores. Well then they didn't get paid. Instead of contacting me, they just cancelled the account. When I realized it I started Pandora again expecting to use the old account. Oh no, now I get charged 4.99 per month through my phone provider. . Then I had to get my phone replaced under warranty defect, and when I restarted Pandora it would just quit playing after a couple songs, and actually froze up. I contacted them with the problem and their online chat person had me uninstall, and then re-install Pandora. Now I am on the free use of Pandora with occasional advertisements, and I think I am going to leave it that way, because I have the feeling they just want more. I don't mind paying, but really, when you pick a music theme or performer, it plays the same songs over and over. So I think the free version is sufficient.",pandora
4/7/2012,"When I first listened to Pandora, I was impressed. They played the type of music that I enjoy. But whenever a song come on that I don't quite like, I just tell Pandora by using the ""thumbs down"" button. Then, I don't ever hear that song again.

11/11/2013,When I first started Pandora I would give it five stars now I give it for because they repeat songs entirely too much,pandora
7/9/2014,When I first started using Pandora there were NO advertising. Now there's nothing but advertising throughout the whole Pandora. I hate all those damn advertising.

4/9/2014,"When you first meet Pandora, you get a light headed feeling. You think to yourself, ""Wow, finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of. You two meet frequently; multiple times a day in fact. You start dreaming of all the flexibility and new music you'd get introduced to. You mess around with different combinations of songs, artists, themes, etc, until you realize something strange is happening! You start to think the worst...is this too good to be true? Have you been taken for a ride and abandoned in some place known as the loop, where all the music you clicked ""like"" to is constantly being played, even on stations that you would not expect to hear them on? You start to panic and say, ""Well maybe the ""free"" version has limitations. So you vacillate between paying for this somewhat weak service in the hopes of strengthen it or just abandoning it all together. You take the plunge--pull out your credit card and go for brokaye, only to be deflated, dejected and sent into a downward spiral of self-pity and regret. Why? Why Pandora Why?",pandora

 It's free to use and you can customize, see lyrics and select the music you want to hear. It really does not get much better.
 
 We played the Christmas channel while wrapping holiday gifts and it was perfect. They will occasionally plug in a short commercial which is not very intrusive and does not last long or occur too frequently, but for a free service, it is well worth it.
 
 It suggests songs for you based on the ones you have already listened to and you can set playlists that allow you to listen to the BGs and the Beatles on the same play list.",pandora

12/5/2013,works well and pandora rocks so 5 stars it is,pandora
5/17/2016,Works well but I question whatever algorithm they are using to select the music that plays on a particular station,pandora
12/9/2016,"Works well enough and like many Android native apps lacks the feature set for BlackBerry. That said, audio quality is excellent.
 
 Not a 4-star product because it nags with emails to the hub! Would be 5-stars if native for BlackBerry and also not nag to emails.
 
 ---UPDATE: June 30, 2017
 - At some point, after an app update, Pandora's audio stream became flaky and unreliable resulting in frequent herky-jerky audio and frequent error messages upon attempt launch ""Pandora not responding"". Used to be able to use hihj-quality audio stream, but now even with lower quality stream problem is very frequent. Interestingly, all my other live-stream apps function great 99% of the time that I experience problems with Pandora. So, if it is related to weak cell signal, it certainly is rarely effecting other live-stream audio apps (music and voice).
 - Pandora used to allow users to increase buffer size to workaround such issues but no longer.
 - Downgraded to one-star
 No guidance from Pandora on this issue and referred to generic Android troubleshooting tips which were useless.",pandora

 I'm impressed!
 It tookay me a couple of tries to find my genre because I guess I like a lot of them
 But once I typed in ""pop rock"" the first song to pop up was my favorite song in
 The whole wide world. The second was I song I loved but couldn't figure out the
 Name.
 The only thing I have to criticize is that there are a lot of pop up ads but you can
 Fix that by upgrading but it costs money.

I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version. Either way, you have access to lots of great music from your favorite artists.",Pandora
