Negative,Just freezes,pandora
Negative,It shuts its self off to much.,pandora
Negative,Don't know they would not except my account.,pandora
Negative,Does not work 95% of the time on my Kindle fire. I have only gotten it to work twice for part of a song. Uninstalled. Works great on my phone .,pandora
Negative,"Fair, not very user friendly",pandora
Negative,"Not a purchase, but an app that I use regularly. Thank you for the service.",pandora
Negative,Love Pandora. Wish that you could skip more songs when you want to though.,pandora
Negative,"A very sophisticated way to listen to music. We can choose a style, a composer or a singer and listen at our own leisure. We can even assign thumbs up or down to the songs we want to listen more or less often. I loved the possibility to read the lyrics of each song or information about the singer, performer or composer. This is a must!",pandora
Negative,"It didn't load automatically to my Kindle like I thought it would. I've spent over 2 hours trying to get it to work, including watching youtube videos and still can't get it on my apps.",pandora
Negative,"why are a lot of songs cut off short,if all of the songs played all the way thru I would give it 5 stares I love it except for that problem",pandora
Negative,It never let me sign in on my kindle fire??,pandora
Negative,Disappointed because I haven't been able to listen to any songs yet on this app. Not sure if I am doing something wrong. Would appreciate some feedback on this,pandora
Negative,if i could give 0 stars. i would . i could not get it to work at all.,pandora
Negative,"I don't like that it doesn't let you skip more than one or two songs in an hour of listening. considering that you're not getting ONLY the artist whose music you selected, they should let you pass on more of the ""selections"" they feature.",pandora
Negative,Didn't work while traveling,pandora
Negative,I think it's a great app. It's all you would want but I personally would like more thumb downs available . But if you are looking for an app to personalize your own stations and optional privacy it's great. Check it's so good I'm listening to it while I'm typing!!!!,pandora
Negative,Does not work on Amazon fire tablet,pandora
Negative,"Not worth the money! You spend too much time selecting/deselecting tunes that you either like/dislike! Time-consuming. The programming does not follow the music interest I select. However, you may find it a better buy, I certainly didn't!",pandora
Negative,I can't get it to play on my Kindle,pandora
Negative,Hate all the ads,pandora
Negative,I could NOT MAKE IT WORK AT ALL on my Kindle device. I have it on several other devices - no problems. I've already deleted it,pandora
Negative,Will not let me login. Keeps saying there is a problem,pandora
Negative,It cuts off too much,pandora
Negative,not cheap enough,pandora
Negative,spotify is way better for daily use less commercials,pandora
Negative,It's never worked right always timed out,pandora
Positive,Love getting my music on all devices.,pandora
Positive,Love Pandora!! Can listen to my music on any device and in even in my car or on TV with DirectTV!,pandora

Positive,I can change ambiance with a click to shuffle -- change mood at a click of a button. Love it!,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora and all the available material they share with listeners...being able to tailor make your own platforms for your preferences is beyong anything most music lovers would require. If you love music this is the site, especially with the option to get rid of the commercials...I highly reccomend this site",pandora
Positive,Great app for students to use in the classroom when they earn Positive breaks. I made a teacher login and made appropriate stations for the kids to listen too.,pandora
Positive,"Amazing variety of free music and for a small monthly fee no ADs. I listen everything from Three Tenors, Bob Marley, CCR, Africa Jazz, Blues, Classical music, B.B King, Eric Clapton, Adel, Lord, Lena Horne to Dancehall Soca. They even have comedy stations. Works wonderfully on cellphones, kindles, tablets, and computers.",pandora
Positive,I like this cause it plays based on taste and helps with channels for styles of music and variety of the time as you can select channels listen or not pending your mood to listen to what. Christmas jazz or rock and roll current. Oldies. I have it all and listen to what I like. Only down side is I cannot get it when I visit Canada.,pandora
Positive,Great music station without to many commercials. It works with bluetooth to stream music to a speaker which you can use anywhere.,pandora
Positive,dad likes it,pandora
Positive,Long time Pandora user and happy to have this app available for my new Microsoft Lumia 950! I have experienced no issues with this app and look forward to continued Pandora enjoyment.,pandora
Positive,Gotta love pandora. Like a dream come true right? Create your own stations based on your own favorite songs. Skip a song if you don't like it or not in the mood? Does it get any better? How did I live without it? Besides what a way to get in the zone when working?,pandora
Positive,"Pandora is a lot of fun. I love the fact that you can personalize the music you listen to by adding in an artist of your choice. However, I do have one complaint. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes you get music that shouldn't even be categorized next to a genre. If I type in ""Disturbed,"" I don't want ""Britney Spears."" Period.",pandora
Positive,"Pandora is wonderful, you have to train your stations just a little at first, but once you do it's fabulous. Much better than Spotify's radio function which offers little variety. It's obvious how much time and care they put into the music genome project.",pandora
Positive,Every good,pandora
Positive,Just love this service.,pandora
Positive,Wonderful! So much music and so many memories brought back by great music. So easy to use.,pandora

Positive,All was well,pandora
Positive,love it.....,pandora
Positive,I am happy to hear some of my favorite tunes! Not so much for the commercials,pandora
Positive,I absolutely love this app. After getting your favorite groups and songs into and as playlists start telling it which songs you like and don't. As the Alger rhythm goes along the playlists start to become just about right on target for what you want. Only throwing in the odd song that makes no sense. Most definitely worth it.,pandora
Positive,"I love this app,I can listen to music that I like",pandora
Positive,love it..,pandora
Positive,wonderful way to add music to my day.,pandora
Positive,I love this app. I listen to music like all the time. I purchased the app for my Kindle Fire and it works great. Now I can have just the music I want anywhere in my house.,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora, great variety and super easy to set up stations. You can have multiple based on different types of music or mix all kinds of music together into one station. It is easy to change around stations as well just by adding new artists to the starting list for that station. Great to have on as background for work.",pandora
Positive,Excellent! Love it.,pandora

Positive,I love Pandora radio.,pandora
Positive,excelent,pandora
Positive,I love having music and a variety of it. I don't buy cds or anything anymore and the regular radio plays too much of the same things or have too many commercials/talk shows. I may have the free version but the commercials really are not intrusive and I can easily look over it. I like to be surprised with songs that I love but may not have heard in awhile or didn't know who did them.,pandora

Positive,"Panadora is one of my favorite FREE apps. I use this app all the time when working out, and I love the variety of music they have for free on here! I just downloaded this to my Kindle as my son loves music and now he can listen to it on the kindle as well! Other than the ""Pop and Hip Hop Power workout"" station playin OLDIES (not sure why this is) I have no issues and love Pandora!",pandora
Positive,"This is really great sound. What a concept! Just start a station off and it keeps adding same genre songs. Tired of that genre, start another station off and it keeps building, too. Tomorrow want some of the same, then maybe something different, start another station, or start an old one. Thumbs down those songs you don't want and they are gone. Thumbs up those to tweak the selections of the future songs. Great deal, and no advertisements. I definitely recommend!",pandora
Positive,Just love it,pandora
Positive,Very good,pandora
Positive,"Every song I choose or radio artist..Is awesome..Its great to hear songs you remember as a Rockin young person,and is just as fun now to listen!",pandora

Positive,"Pandora app is the best! If you love music and you simply want some relaxation music or want to get up and dance, Pandora has it all. The sound on the Kindle Fire HD is simply a knock out. Cannot believe that sound comes out of that thin piece of amazement!!!! Truly, I recommend getting the full version of this app. It is not much and is totally worth it.  Thanks to Pandora and amazon.com.",pandora
Positive,"I have the free version. Every now and then it asks if you are still listening and/or you hear a few ads, but I don't find it annoying enough to upgrade and pay monthly for it. The genre picked does tend to play the same songs over and over, but there are many options to choose from and change the genre playing to change up the songs whenever you want. Can't beat it for free!!??",pandora
Positive,Good App,pandora
Positive,Works as expected,pandora
Positive,I absolutely love Pandora! We are constantly playing it in my home when it is time to do some housework...and I play it at work some too.,pandora

Positive,Love the format and station options. Enjoy the wide variety and the option to create your own stations. Highly recommended.,pandora
Positive,It works for me. I love it. I live in an apartment building and my neighbors say they hear Pandora coming from my apt. and love the music. Some also use it. I'm 66 years old and find it difficult to listen to my car radio. There is less music on the car radio then ever before. I like having choices and with Pandora you do.,pandora
Positive,"I like that I can select the songs and artists that I like to listen to, and I can give songs it ads that are similar a thumbs up or down.

For now it serves its purpose, great workout music and the best music the genre has to offer is offered on Pandora.",pandora
Positive,"I love this app! I have all my different stations set up, and use Pandora on my computer, cell phone and Kindle! I do subscribe to it, so don't worry about ads and stopping my programs. Well worth the price, which is minimal. Who needs radio when you can have Pandora?!!",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora because of the ease of use and because I can quickly create and customize my radio stations.  I did not rate Pandora a five simply because one must suscribe to the paid service for unlimited listening. That said, I will probably upgrade to the paid service anyway, because it is really a nominal cost for such a great service.",pandora
Positive,The music never stops!Love that I can pick my favourite song and they play songs in the same genre! Awesome!,pandora

Positive,Love Pandora! Love how it basically mskes a radio station around your likes and dislikes of music.,pandora

Positive,"Love that I can pick the type of music that I love. I was disappointed though because when I put in my favorite Ricky Nelson in, it really just gave me that kind of music, but not necessarily Ricky Nelson. I would have loved a bunch of his music. Otherwise, I really like Pandora.",pandora
Positive,I love pandora radio. first I love that its easy to use. Second the music is great you can put a artist or genre & it plays the songs .. what I also love is that you can search music from a certain time for example the 70's and it plays music exactly from that time only. I have found so many songs I have been looking for using pandora! Love it!,pandora
Positive,"I found Pandora in 2008, and loved the idea so much I signed up for Pandora|ONE as soon as it was released. We rarely, if ever, listen to broadcast radio anymore and use Pandora almost exclusively. The app is great, does what it's supposed to do - nothing more, nothing less, and it works.",pandora
Positive,Love the music and customizing my stations to what I enjoy.,pandora
Positive,I love this station. Love gospel music and only place I can find old fashioned gospel music. Thanks,pandora
Positive,Love the music and the ease,pandora
Positive,"I love listening what I get to choose., thanks pandora",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora but not on the this tablet. It drains the battery too quickly!,pandora
Positive,"If you love music and have love many different types of music...this is your kinda app. You can create your own stations...bypass songs that have no interest...and tweek it so it's all your favorites in one. This is a must have on your phone, laptop or kindle. Rock on!",pandora

Positive,I love the free station! I can select the types of music I like and it'll just play continuously. I don't mind the advertisements either... it's a FREE station. I love the classical music selections!,pandora
Positive,"The app's function is fine. I've always loved Pandora, but it seems like over the last year or so,there are more commercials than music. Also, be careful of what songs you like, the programs will start to meld together, regardless what channel or artist station you're on.",pandora
Positive,"Love Pandora, have been listening for last three years",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora. This app is great for listening to your favorite kind of music all on one station. I use it to work out when I'm at the gym, and on my commute.  Pro:  -You can ""like"" the song to make sure you get to hear it again, and give the song a thumbs down to ensure the station doesn't play it again.  -Limited commercial interruptions  -Free!  Cons:  -Can only skip a limited number of songs  -When I'm in the car it has to run on 3G which uses a lot of data",pandora
Positive,I listen almost every night for about 30 minutes. I enjoy almost every type of music but love hearing the 50-60s music the most.,pandora
Positive,"I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this app. Free music. What could go wrong. I use this app at least once a day, sometimes more. It's so easy to navigate and even thought there is ads, it won't bother you because it's just so awesome",pandora
Positive,I think this is a fabulous way to listen to music. Love the radio station choices geared to one;s personal preferences as well as the cross references that lead from one liked singer or group to a similar one. The only criticism I have is that the search mechanism does not include song titles. It is necessary to know who recorded the song to find it.,pandora
Positive,I love this App. I just don't like the constant reminder that I am not logged in to iTunes.,pandora
Positive,I have a kindle fire hd and I love listening to music. This app worked great I didn't have a problem with it at all . It's like a radio only you can skip the song if you don't like it but you can only skip so many times. So I suggest that you pick a station that you like. It's like Pandora on a regular computer only it's portable. Again love this app .,pandora
Positive,I really love this app it very awesome but I gave it 4 stars because you get lots of adds and only get like 15 skip the song things in a day otherwise it is the best music app,pandora
Positive,Love Pandora. Great music,pandora
Positive,Love it. Use it every day,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora. I can choose the kind of music I want to listen to instead of the mix you find on the radio.,pandora

Positive,"Love being able to pinpoint the kind of music I want to listen to. Love being able to vote down music that I don't like and thumbs up to music I especially enjoy so the station will seek more of the same.  Like being able to choose different venues to suit my mood.  one of my most favorite and freqently used ap on my Kindle Fire",pandora
Positive,Love the free streaming and the commercials don't last too painfully long!,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora. I had it on my computer for years and have lots of good stations. Just put it on my Kindle so I could take it with me.  I like the old Jimmy Rogers songs and Roy Bookbinder,you can't hear them just any place.",pandora

Positive,Love the many choicest I have to all types of music,pandora
Positive,Love Pandora!,pandora
Positive,I absolutely love having all the different artists available to me at once.,pandora
Positive,"I'd say I love it but for one quirky habit it has of replaying the same songs over and over... and often the least liked of all the songs in my preferred ""alternative"" repertoire. Other than that - nifty app!",pandora

Positive,"Great app. I finally broke down and use the pay version now. I love it! i listen to relaxation, meditation music at night when i have trouble sleeping, rock &roll when walking, blues, jazz, classical, folk, country, even a comedy 'station'. Love this app",pandora
Positive,I love this app. I use it every day and I love that I can listen to my music anywhere!,pandora
Positive,"Pandora is my most favorite music app ever, it's perfect for anyone who wants to listen to their favorite genre of music. And all you have to do is put in your favorite bands and shuffle. I love it!!",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora. The music gets me through my day.,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora and stream music when I'm golfing with friends. I wish the ad free version wasn't extra.,pandora
Positive,Love Pandora.. We put it on every night on 'spa radio' when getting the little one to sleep. My only complaint is you have to pay for it to be commercial free. The commercials are too loud.,pandora
Positive,"I use this app across multiple devices. It was extremely easy to download and is very user friendly. Since my Kindle does not have expandable storage, this app allows me to listen to the musicIi love without having to transfer files and use much internal memory.",pandora
Positive,I love it but I want to be able to listen to my music on the bus with no WiFi and also love it but I really wish you could use it without WiFi.,pandora
Positive,Love!!!,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora. So fun and exposes you to new music. I do not find the ads too frequent at all. I highly recommend. It seems to turn off less frequently on the phone than the desk top BTW.,pandora

Positive,I chose this rating because i love this app. What i like about this app is that i can listen to all the music i like and i can have as many stations as i want there's no limit and also that i can put all my music on shuffle. I recommend this app to everyone its a great app.,pandora
Positive,Love that I can access my paid Pandora account on my Kindle Fire. I use it constantly. Thanks for the app!,pandora
Positive,"being in my 60's, or because I have an eclectic taste in music, it has become hard to find a radio station that carries more that 2 or 3 artist's work. With this, I select the artists I want to hear that day, hit shuffle and I'm good for the day! Love it!",pandora
Positive,I have loved Pandora since I first started using it. Great place to listen to music. I've tried others but have never been as pleased as o am with Pandora.,pandora
Positive,Only 4 STARS because when I put pause on my music it did not pause and went to another station. I was so mad but free music that is what everyone loves yay free.,pandora
Positive,Absolutely love Pandora. Gives such a great range of music even on one particular station. Love how I can like the songs and go back at any time to see all the songs I have a thumbs up too. It replays the songs I like a sufficient amount of times but never too excessive! Great app!,pandora
Positive,You'd be crazy not to love Pandora,pandora
Positive,Love that I can load it to my Echo,pandora
Positive,"Love this app, always music I want to listen to.",pandora
Positive,"I really don't like the ads. There will be ads telling me about the ""ad free"" listening I'm taking part in and I'm sure I don't have to explain why this irks me. There are also ads almost every time I skip a song or switch stations. Otherwise I love this app. I have a station for pretty much any mood I have and a variety to cover whatever else I'd enjoy hearing. Favorite part is it's free. I won't pay for the ad free, I just turn it down or tune it out.",pandora

Positive,Love the music!!!,pandora
Positive,"i love it, can get all the really old songs , i am in 7th heaven",pandora
Positive,"I don't know how I had ever survived without Pandora! I was a satellite radio fan until I moved to where I could not install the antenna properly to receive it. I was waiting for the right time to compile an MP3 collection, for years. But I was always more in love with the spontaneity of radio. You know something is really one of your favorite things if the only regret you have with it is why hadn't I discovered it sooner. I could have had so much more fun and so many less boring drives and so many less years of wondering when I was going to have the time and money to develop an extensive MP3 collection that would be able to come anywhere close to the # of my favorite songs that exist in the world. The thumbs up/thumbs down feature really is what you should pay attention to, because that is what really personalizes the station for you. You will be surprised how many new artists/songs that you might like that you may never have heard otherwise. I didn't even know i was interested in new artists until their style so logically followed my other old favorite styles of songs & artists. It's an ingenious system. So fun, so little work",pandora
Positive,Love the music media. Thank you for the great selections.,pandora
Positive,Great choices for this baby boomer!!! Love it!!,pandora
Positive,Love to listen to the Hawaiian music stations...,pandora
Positive,"I like this app, but I can't figure out how to bring up the whole album and sample all the songs like I can on my laptop. Maybe the Kindle doesn't support this feature or I haven't figured how to use the feature yet. LOVE using it.",pandora

Positive,"Love it. Hate commercials. But I am cheap, so I deserve them!",pandora

Positive,"Love it, love the simplicity of Pandora. And thanks for the little perks every now and then, i.e free hour for watching a 15 sec add.",pandora
Positive,"love choice of music and you cannot beat ""free"". The only downside is the fidelity is not too great. Sirius was no better and they charge.",pandora
Positive,I love how when you turn off your music keeps playing taking no battery,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora. It's a great option when you don't really want to think about what to listen to but want to listen to some great music.,pandora
Positive,I am so glad we have Pandora. I read bios of my favorite music. I can listen to what I want and buy on the spot. I can listen to Pandora on my phone. I Love Pandora,pandora
Positive,"I have enjoyed Pandora on my IPad for about 5 years. Love that you can pick your own music, pick different artists or genre and play it on shuffle. Now that I have the echo I can listen to it on that, and the best part, it is free.",pandora
Positive,this app doesn't disappoint--each song builds on other selections and exposure to artists that are not normally always heard. I've built up my music by having Pandora and I love being able to hear different genre's that I normally would not have the opportunity to listen to.,pandora
Positive,Love the music choosing ability but not happy with the continuous popup adds. Way more adds then reasonable to expect. Refuse to fall for the passive aggressive method of having to pay monthly fees to avoid them.,pandora
Positive,Its hard to choose which music i want to listen to because they really are all so great. love to listen at night before bed. Thanks for making it available!,pandora
Positive,Wow!! what a media product. Works fantastic on my Amazon Echo and my Amazon Fire. Love my Pandora Sistar radio!,pandora

Positive,"I love Pandora, I can hear any type of music.",pandora
Positive,Love it. 5 stars.,pandora
Positive,"When I worked as a receptionist, I would ask whoever was waiting about their favorite musicians and create a new station for them. Now that I have a kid, I use it to play lullabies most nights. It is wonderful to have constant random music that I love pop up rather than having to constantly cycle through my cds or deal with radio replays. There aren't too many commercials, and lately, the free hour of music ads have been really appreciated.",pandora
Positive,"I love that I get to hear any artist/music that I want to, when I want to.",pandora
Positive,"I suggest you get this app if your a music lover and want music fast and easy. Also pandora has new free hits like &#34;it's all about that base&#34;, &#34;black widow&#34;, and&#34;trumpets&#34;",pandora

Positive,I love being able to hear the radio about anywhere. Love my country music.,pandora
Positive,"Gotta love Pandora. I enjoy listening to music that suits my likes and plays more of what you wan to hear. Of course, the ads do get annoying as well as it stopping the music to ask you if you are still listening. However, when its free, I guess you have to accept some bit of annoyances. Overall, a great app.",pandora
Positive,Love Pandora keeps me motivated while working out and makes it fun,pandora
Positive,"Pandora is my ""go to"" music app on my tablet when I am connected to a wireless signal. I love that I can rate music with thumbs up / thumbs down and pandora will play more or less music according to what I have liked/not liked. Great way to discover new tunes. Also lets you view lyrics to some songs and artist biographies.",pandora
Positive,"Pandora is AWESOME! I love the selections of music. I am old school and I love listening to my oldie favorites. I also listen to it at the elementary school I work at during the week. The children work so great to the calming instrumental music. Thank you.",pandora

I cannot blue tooth the Kindle, it just will not find my speaker and I have tried everything to get to work.  Got the new Kindle Fire HD today. Download Pandora but cannot blue tooth the Kindle to my Jabra Speaker. If I am unable to use blood tooth, I doubt it worth keeping the Kindle. Betty",pandora

Positive,love love love it!,pandora
Positive,"I don't install that many apps on my Kindle. (I currently have Yahoo Mail, Adobe Reader, NewEgg, and U.S. Presidents installed.)  I installed Pandora a week or so ago, the first app I installed in a couple months, and more as a lark than anything. I love Pandora, and have it on my iPhone and my computer. I listened for a few minutes, then paused it, went to the home screen, and then forgot about it.  A few days later I opened my Kindle; Nothing happened. I assumed the battery was drained. I pressed the Power button a few seconds: it gave a little chime, nothing else. I closed the Oragami case, hooked up the charger, and let it sit for twenty minutes. Then I tried opening it. Nothing. I pressed the Power Button again, a little chime. I waited half a minute and the lock screen appeared. The indicator said 64% charged, so it had some charge the whole time.  I tried unlocking the Kindle. Nothing happened for about twenty seconds, then the unlock icon slid left and after a few more seconds the PIN screen appeared. I entered my PIN, nothing. Then after a few seconds the dots appeared, one a second or so, and the screen unlocked. I pressed the Home Screen button, and after a few more seconds the Home Screen appeared.  I got to the Apps section, and uninstalled Pandora. I rebooted the Kindle, and everything was normal. I have had no problems since I uninstalled Pandora.  Maybe it was an interaction with Pandora, or maybe it runs in the background and got confused when I left my home WiFi network. I am not sure what happened exactly, but when something radically unexpected happens I have to think it was the most-recent change that caused it, especially since my main use for my Kindle is reading books.",pandora
Positive,I love the line up after selecting your song of choice,pandora

Positive,I love Pandora.,pandora
Positive,I love this app,pandora
Positive,I highly recommend this for u music lovers out there who just like free music. The only set back is that u can only skip so many songs a day and that u have to pay to get it ad free. Those are the only to reasons that I rated it with 3 stars.,pandora
Positive,I love that you can play anything you want,pandora
Positive,I Love Pandora. I love listening to it when I am cooking in the kitchen. I like having it on to turn on random songs why I am running or walking. The only thing I don't like about it is it's streaming and using up your data on your phone. And it uses a lot of data. But the stations you can make up and you can add other artist to the stations you can make up is pretty awesome. I have the Neighbourhood radio station. Do you that I added Calvin Harris. So I can have dramatic songs and happy dance songs all at once. It's kind of like having the best of both worlds.,pandora
Positive,I love that I can listen to whatever I like,pandora
Positive,"Love the ""Moody Blues"" on Pandora. It has all my favorite",pandora

Positive,"I have the free subscription,and I love it. I have enjoyed Sirius FM in my Ford Escape,but cancelled it because of cost. I am 80 years old, retired 21 years,and watching my expenses. Sirius offered a half-price deal for six months, which I accepted. When that expired, I cancelled again. When I received a free subscription to Pandora, I accepted. Pandora offers a wide variety of music selections to suit almost anyone's desires. Pandora also offers a premium version with no commercial advertising for about &4 per month which is about the same as Sirius offers for a 6 month contract. I feel that I am receiving better music choices at a lower cost,since I have the free version, but would still prefer Pandora even if I chose to pay for their premium service",pandora

Positive,"I love Pandora! It is the best radio for my kindle. The only thing I would change about it (and I hope they do), is that if u have the free version you only have 40 hours per month of listening time. So when I get up to 40 hours, I start listening to my iheart radio.",pandora
Positive,How could you hate something that gives you what you want for free. The only thing I would change is there is no ban artist button. which I would love. If I get an artist I hate I just push the thumbs down button really fast! hahaha,pandora

It is easy to use and plays what I like a majority of the time. I will say: UPGRADE TO PANDORA ONE. Commercial free, it is SO worth it. I will gladly pay the $36 a year to not listen to annoying commercials and see continuous pop ups. This is by far one of my favorite apps.",pandora
Positive,Love/ it,pandora
Positive,"This is wonderful and plays a lot of good music. You can comment on songs,like them,share them,follow people,comment on people's profile. But you have to be 14 or older to log in. Still I love it",pandora
Positive,this app is exilent. I use it all the time and it is so easy to control. And I really love the fact that it has a timer and alarm.,pandora
Positive,I love this app because I love the music,pandora
Positive,"I love the stations and feeds on Pandora but if your bank changes your debit or credit card number...you are in for many phone calls to Amazon and emails to Pandora...you can not contact Pandora directly by phone. Getting my billing straight, as I am a Pandora One subscriber, took about three weeks. They have also reformatted how you view info about the artists and the music several times. They should have left alone;/if it's not broke don't fix it. Sometimes I can't connect wirelessly when away from home and on a free Wi-Fi and that is annoying and disappointing.",pandora

Positive,"Pandora is great! I TRULEY RECOMMEND You can listen to music of your choice, for free, it precautions you when a song is explicit that is about to be played... so if you have a child listening that maybe shouldn't hear something... but you can change that under settings. You can turn on the sleep timer for however long and you can fall a sleep to the music... and it will even stop in the middle of a song too. You can send a specific station or track to a friend on Facebook and a couple other ways... which is great. When you find a specific station and you click the like buttons (thumbs) or dislike buttons, it will sort the music based upon what it thinks you will like... which is great because you may not know exactly which song you wish to listen to... so it selects one for you, also it's great because if it is a classical station you might love a specific song so, you make a station for it then you can listen to it In... say d flat major",pandora
Positive,"Okay, so I'm late in this whole online streaming thing in my 40's, But I was highly impressed with Pandora. Within the first 15 minutes, this app had somehow determined what type of musing I like and what other artists I might enjoy. I was hooked instantly. When they say you never hear a song you DON'T LIKE, they mean it. The more you rate, the more tailored your listening experience becomes. I LOVE/LIVE music......this app meets my standards!

Positive,love the app,pandora
Positive,Oh how much do I love Pandora? I listen at work and I listen at home. If I had an unlimited data plan I would likely listen to it more but I use it on my wireless without a problem. I can mix my stations and add songs. I am a fan of Pandora!,pandora

Positive,"I love Pandora, and I probably listen to it at least 6 hours a day. However, there are 2 problems with the app that I have. First of all, the app used to display the song and artist as well as a pause button in the drop down tool bar on the Kindle Fire. It would be nice to have that back. This way I don't need to be in Pandora to see what song or artist it is. Second, when the stations are on shuffle, it doesn't say which station the song currently playing is coming from. This is a problem because I can't like or dislike songs for fear of them being on the wrong station. Other than thos two complaints,the Pandora app is awesome!",pandora
Positive,I have only been using Pandora for a week but I love it.,pandora
Positive,I love it.,pandora
Positive,Pandora is The Best! Great selection of music. Always there when you need it. I'm able to stream wherever I go. I had Sirus for a short time and it was terrible.

However, when I WANT it to play music, i.e. I click it on purpose... it doesn't begin to play for 30 minutes. They need to work out the glitches.",pandora
Positive,Really like listening to it. I inadvertently hit the dislike button on a song that I really love and now I dont know how to request it back on there or undo what I did. I was trying to get my volume bar up and hit dislike by mistake!!! Especially love it at Christmas time.,pandora

You can make your own ""radio stations"" and you can download the whole album, not just certain songs. It also puts them into categories, which I like (country, alternative, etc.) For example, in his country, he has the ""Lee Brice"" station, his rap the ""Eminem"" station, etc. And then your music will play in the background while you do whatever else you want on your tablet - check e-mails, facebook, play games, etc.",pandora

Positive,Love it !!! Listen to my music wherever I want,pandora
Positive,I absolutely love Pandora.,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora on my laptop, and now I love it on my Fire HD, too! It works great, but be warned that there are way more (visual) ads on the tablet than on the PC version. At least, that's the way that it seems, but perhaps this has something to do with the much smaller screen. I can certainly forgive these ads, however, since the radio stations that Pandora creates for me are so fun to listen to, and they need to make their money some way. If I grow tired of the ads, I can always upgrade my Pandora account, so as to eliminate them for a fee. However, I don't spend that much time even looking at the tablet when this app is in use- and as a nice bonus, the display darkens after the app has been running for some time, so as to conserve battery power (the speakers will still play the music, of course, and the app continues to run).",pandora
Positive,"Love Pandora. It's a great way to listen to different kinds of music that harmonise with one's nerve strings. It's a good starting place to get basic info about the composer and musician(s). Some of the choices will even inspire to shell out the cash for a more permanent option.  The free version is financed by ads, but they are not too oppressive, and, after all, this is primarily a music outlet. However, when the audio ads come on, pressing the Mute button for a 5-count of ""Mississippi One..."" takes care of that.",pandora
Positive,"Love the Pandora app, I can hear music all day from my kindle. It is very simple to download and use, definitely recommend it.",pandora
Positive,I love it and thinking seriously about doing the upgrade. I like it because you do offer it free with limited commercials. You get to choose what you like to hear and its easy to navigate around I love it at work at home.,pandora
Positive,Pandora is the best Internet radio I loveit!!,pandora
Positive,I don't know how I got along before Pandora. Mu husband and I listen to it all the time. I wish someone would come out with a radio that played Pandora music directly from Pandora. My husband is in a nursing home and would love to be able to listen to Pandora using one simple device that was not likely to be stolen.,pandora
Positive,I love this app! I can hear a variety of random gospel and Christian music and ministry! Great artists and great sound quality!!!,pandora
Positive,Pandora is an AMAZING app that I just can't help but love. It plays all the latest hits and even plays a few of the olds. Not to mention that it has so many stations and you can even add some so I get my country music while me mom can jam to her rock n roll.,pandora

Actually offered to make a donation when I first discovered it a couple years ago - they thanked me and suggested I subscribe (didn't know about they offered a subscription service). The staff went without pay for a time early on until Pandora received their first round of venture funding. Best part about Pandora is the opportunity to discover new talent (some don't even have bios yet) or established artists you've never listed to. Maybe Pandora's competitors offer something like this - don't know, don't care. It's Pandora for me.",pandora

I really love that I can have my kindle charging and have pandora play while my kindle is turned off (not powered off, just the screen) and it'll still charge and play the music!  The only problem I have with this app (and why it's not five stars) is that sometimes when I closed the app, it'll start up the app again (causing it to switch out what I'm doing to pandora). I found that I couldn't just leave the app, I had to actually hit the menu button (on the upper right corner) to quit so that it would stay closed.  Other than that, I found no faults and would definitely recommend this free app to anyone!",pandora

Positive,"I love this app. It is easy to use and lets you choose what ""channel"" you like listening to. It wlll give you a variety of different ""Like"" songs to the type you requsted. I don't like that you can only skip 6 songs in an hour and it MAKES you listen to those you don't like. I think you should have th option to skip if its not your fave...waste of good listening time and money ifyou have purchased Pandora for the ""no commercials"" aspect, which I have. Also, I listen to it at work and if you don't ""Like"" or ""Dislike"" evey once in awhile it will pause your station and make you answer ""ARE YOU THERE, WE PAY FOR OUR MUSIC SO WE DON'T LIKE PLAYING TO AN EMPTY ROOM"" what the ????I mean really?

Positive,Love the variety of music,pandora
Positive,"What can I say, who doesn't love Pandora? You can make your favorite channel by picking your favorite song, your favorite artist, your favorite genre or just add the already made channels by Pandora. You can also give each song you hear a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down"" which helps to train the station to play what you like. If a particular song comes on and you don't feel like listening to it, you can move ahead to the next song. It really gives a good mix of music and I really enjoy listening to it. I have found this app to be quite reliable. I never seem to have a problem with it crashing. I have it downloaded to my phone and tablet. In the car, I hook up the phone to the car's speakers before I leave the parking lot and using my 4G, I listen to Pandora as I drive around. It is so much better than listening to local radio that plays whatever it wants instead of what I want. I am very happy with this app!",pandora

Positive,"I have enjoyed Pandora in the past, but now listening to Rhapsody more often. I like both. Between Pandora, Rhapsody and my iPod, and the radio I have more than enough for my music needs. I love the concept of creating a personal radio station.",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora. I love I can select any artist and it links up similar artist. When I am working from home I listen to Pandora a good part of the day when not on conference calls.,pandora
Positive,"Pros:I love Pandora because it is pretty much like a radio and an MP3 Player combined in the sense that,you can choose your favorite songs,singers,rappers,or bands and the radio will give you their stations along with similar music related to what you chose.For example,if you type into the search engine,Brittney Spears,then her songs will show up with the new Britney Spears station you created and they will also add some songs from a similar artist like Cristina Aguilera,etc.I like this because you can learn new songs from many different artists.Pandora is really great at blending similar song styles.You can share the song or station you are listening to on facebook or twitter also.You are also allowed to skip a song you don't like by either pressing the skip icon or the dislike icon.The songs also comes with biography info about the artist/artists and the lyrics to each song as well as the album name.FREE.  Cons:Since Pandora is free and they pay for licenses to the songs,you are only allowed five or six skips a day.Afterwards,you can either stick it out or just change the station to something else.Pandora seems to only have certain songs from different artists not ALL their songs so even if you were to type in ""Count on Me"" by Bruno Mars for example into the search engine,it may just give you a different Bruno Mars song or a song like the one you requested but by a different artist altogether.Also,you cannot REWIND,FAST FORWARD,or REPLAY a song at all and I think that goes back to the fact that they have to pay for it.And,if you type in a song you just recently listened to and try to hear it again,for some reason it doesn't let you.  Summary: Pandora is a free radio station app where you can find your favorite songs and artists simply by typing their names into a search engine.You can always edit,meaning you can delete or add stations and it is a great way to learn new songs.While the skips are limited to five or six a day,each song provides you with lyrics and background information on the artist.You can always share what you are listening to on Facebook,Twitter,etc to let friends and family know but just remember you cannot replay a song so wait a bit to try to find it in the search engine.If you hit the like icon on a song,that particular song is more likely to show back up quicker so you wont have to wait long for it but just remember that you cannot rewind or fast forward,you can only PAUSE.Pandora is completely Iphone compatible and even pauses itself when you get an incoming phone call so you can always go back and resume a song when you are done talking.On the Kindle Fire,Pandora shows up nice and big on the screen which will help you to read the lyrics better! In all,Pandora is a amazing app to get for any device that is capable of having it and is the best music app created!!",pandora
Positive,"LOVE LOVE LOVE PANDORA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLAY IT EVERYDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MAKES MY WORKOUTS GO BY FASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LIKE MAKING MY OWN STATIONS IT SUPER FUN!!!!",pandora

Positive,i love it.great music,pandora
Positive,"I practice meditation and deeply love classic and SOME ""New Age"" music. I was given a Kindle Fire HD for a gift, and overall, I like it. The Kindle, that is. However, the person who said it is an instrument set up for Amazon's benefit and NOT the customers...had it right. Pandora is an excellent example of how Amazon bilks its customers: the App is advertised as ""free"", which causes the customer to download it, only to discover that to get any real pleasure out of it, there is a fee to be paid. Pandora is advertised as free: download it, tell it what you like, and you will get the music you want FOR FREE. Not so, of course: if you want the music for free, you must put up with horrible advertisements. If I liked rock-n-roll, it wouldn't be so bad, but right after an exquisite, soft, relaxing piece of music, I have to listen to a lengthy commercial for Allstate, or house paint or...whatever. Ads pop up all over the place. You can't see the album covers for ads. Oh, but wait: just pay the price, and the ads will go away! The price, by the way--at this point--isn't that bad. What I resent is that (1) the ""station"" created by Pandora for my liking doesn't play what I want, it plays what IT wants; and (2) I wasn't told ahead of time that if I wanted to actually be able to enjoy the App, I had to pay. I have found this to be true of nearly everything I have tried on my Kindle. The only thing it is truly good for is reading, and even then, the books are often poorly formatted, loaded with editing mistakes and misspelled words. The Apps are loaded with ads and invariably end up costing money the customer isn't warned about ahead of time. As for Pandora, it is very disappointing...I will continue to look for an applications that is put together with some sense of ethical idealism, one that doesn't break my eardrums with commercials and lurid pop-up ads.",pandora
Positive,I just love using this app! I listened 2 it when I am doing nothing or while I am bowling. Also when I'm out doing things.,pandora
Positive,The best love love love Pandora,pandora

Positive,"This app is a nifty program! I was looking for an all-in-one app (something like iTunes-but they dont make iTunes for my device), and this one came closest to the mark. You can listen three ways: --Upload all your own music --Purchase music from Pandora --Listen to unlimited, free music in the form of ""radio stations""  The feature I like the most is the Radio Station ""maker"". You can make custom lists of songs that Pandora will play in sequence, and it does NOT have to be music you already own or have to buy.  For example, if you like a specific genre of music, you can choose that search feature, Pandora will go out and grab music that falls into the category and make you a radio station of it. If it brings in a song you dislike-you click on ""skip"" button and it will be discarded from your station.  You can also rate songs so the app will learn what interests you.  You can make other radio stations (and keep the many different stations you make in a library) by using your own music or by combining yours with Pandora's.  You can make radio stations of a single band, specific genre's, or many other different ways. It's a great app to find music you are thinking about purchasing and listen to all of it first, or to find music you haven't heard yet from a band you love, and even find other bands you've never heard before based on music you like.  The app comes in a free, ad-based version (the ad's are NOT annoying and relentless), or you can get a paid app. The one I use is the free one, and you barely notice the ad's and infrequent short commercials. Great music listening software!",pandora

Positive,"I think Pandora is the best option for listening to music, other than maybe the actual radio. The commercial breaks aren't that long, and they aren't ridiculously frequent. You can control exactly what kind of music you listen to, and there's no limit on how many channels you can have. There's the skip button for when you hear a track way too often, although there is a limit on how many times you can use that. Of course, there's always the alternative (and unlimited) way to skip a song: just change stations. All in all, I can't think of anything bad about Pandora, other than the fact that if you don't have internet you can't use it. But, most devices have mobile data and/or a personal hotspot, so if you REALLY feel the need to listen, you can. I love Pandora!",pandora

That has saved us from getting bored with our own (extensive, but too familiar) music collection.  One of the most fun things we have done with Pandora was to pass the iPod around at a party for friends to start new ""Pandora radio stations"" for us by selecting musicians who were new to us. Found a world of great music that way.  LOVE Pandora.",pandora

I don't really understand why other people r having so much trouble it whilst it is simple to use. the commercials that come w/ the free one r small and don't bother w/ the song. <3 dat u can do other stuff like web surfing while listening to pandora,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora! I use it all the time and it provides a great selection of music unlike the radio which repeats constantly. A bunch of people say they don't like it because of the adds; but there is a thirty second or less add every five or more songs; so that is not a good complaint. I give it five stars completly!,pandora
Positive,i used to love it but now it seems that when I hit thumbs up I never here the song again and it never plays songs related to the songs I like just irrelevant songs and songs I don't like,pandora
Positive,"This delivers music with very little ads. But music that YOU pick, you ""like"" and you might not yet know, but may grow to love. It's free content for the cost of listen to an ad or two every five or six songs and REALLY free if you use it over wi-fi and not on your limited data plan smart phone. So much fun!",pandora
Positive,"I love not having to listen to commercials, skipping all the music I don't want to listen to. This is a good deal.",pandora
Positive,"Pandora is amazing I always have it on my Tv when I'm cleaning or just wanna listen to music . my life basically revolves around music so I would so recommend this to people who love listening to music! you can create ur stations nd sometimes find songs u never thought u will like, I love it && I'm Positive u will too :)",pandora
Positive,I love this app. it can get a little glitchy at times but for the most part runs smoothly. if I do have trouble with a station I just switch the station or restart the app. its a great companion for when I get bored of the music I have. nice way to learn of new artists. I definitely reccomend it.,pandora
Positive,I think that this is a great app I have it on all of my electronics and it has all different types of music for all different types of people I love this app and I think you should get it.,pandora
Positive,"it is a good app and has new and current music (I should know from being a teenager) but the only problem is that it only allows you to use 6 skips per hour per station :( ugh that makes me mad cause there could be a song that was made in the 70's and I cant skip it. but overall, its a good app :)  Jesus loves ya""ll",pandora
Positive,love pandora took some time for it to get a good mix going. would never go back now love it!!!!,pandora
Positive,Love the music on this app..I would highly recommend it. Its free and no one can beat free lol. YAY,pandora

Positive,I love Pandora. This is the reason I bought blue rays for all my tv's and why I bought more gigs for my cell phone. I listen to Pandora all day and sometimes during the night.,pandora
Positive,This is worth the 4.99 a month I love the variety of music to select from and no commercials,pandora
Positive,this app is the best. Just put in a song you like and it will play that song & songs similar to it. You can create lots of stations - pick some of their own/hardly Any commercials - just a very cool way to rock out to tunes. Love it,pandora

Positive,I love Pandora it is amazing whenever I'm sick I listen to it in bed I really recommend this app,pandora
Positive,"this app loads nicely and is very easy to navigate. it's great to listen to music while reading to drown out distracting noises like the tv. create multiple artist or group radio stations and enjoy the music. it even has a shuffle function. the ads are short and far in between so not a nuisance at all. love, love, love this app.",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora. I use it for rain music for my massage sessions. BUT.... Four stars because I am still limited in skips even as a paying user.,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora, i love to listen to the Christmas songs and , Southern Gospel songs..",pandora
Positive,I use this app every day. I love it. earlier I got a new update. this update has much more than before. now Ill use it whenever possible.,pandora
Positive,"I love the Pandora service, whenever I can I'm listening to Pandora One, it provides me with the music I like that I cant find anywhere else and provides a constant tune to my life.

Positive,Pandora is always good...I love it! ??,pandora
Positive,"It should be for all age cause everyone love to listen to songs, cause it makes them be who they want to be",pandora
Positive,"Often I like music, but can't identify the artist. This app allows me to do that. In addition, it provides me with ""like"" artists; music of the same genre or by the same artist which I would not necessarily seek out. I love these features.",pandora
Positive,it is awesome I love this app you need to get it it is a must have I have had this app forever and never got sick or tiered of it,pandora
Positive,"What more can I say? I love Pandora for the music varieties it provides. I am not much a station hopper, so once I set the type of music, mostly classical, the numbers of music come through are satisfying. Furthermore, the quality of sound is impecable - it is definitely one of my favs.",pandora
Positive,Still love Pandora after all these years.,pandora
Positive,"I used to love this app so much until the newest update, it makes me feel uncomfortable and has lost many main features such as the sleep timer. :(",pandora

Positive,"listen all the time ,prefer music with no words, love it !!!",pandora
Positive,"I love listening to this while I work in the kitchen or am just hanging out. I've also discovered some new artists that I've never heard of before due to the stations playing similar music to artists I already like. I highly recommend. There are commercials, but not too often. Thumbs up.",pandora
Positive,I love it. pick your own music and its free!!!!!!!!!!!,pandora
Positive,I love this app it just plays songs without you having to select one,pandora
Positive,I use it daily I love it.,pandora
Positive,LOVE Pandora. It is a great way to hear your favorite artists but also learn about new artists and tracks that are very similar. I listen to it when I work out...my favorite station is Pit Bull. And when I am in the bath...favorite station is 2 Chellos. It rocks! Literally.,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora , listen all the time on my kindle fire",pandora
Positive,I loved this app until recently. the video advertisements freeze the app if you aren't actually on the app. think they are trying to make you physically watch the commercials. happens all too often for a person who works with their hands constantly. iheartradio hear I come.,pandora
Positive,"It is so wonderful to listen to music I love, the words I can hear and even sing along.....the best part I choose the music and it is there for me....always. I have heard songs that I have not heard in YEARS!!! The best part it is FREE!!!!",pandora
Positive,"I love the music choices, but I think its stupid how we have to pay for it after a certain number of hours I. the mobile devices. I mean, if its free on the computer then why do you have to pay for it here?? so I guess its back to iheartradio for me",pandora
Positive,I love this its better then youtube and music on your apple devices but comercials seriously on a music app that's stupid but that's all I have to complain about. all u have 2 do is stop with the commercials we see enough of those on Tv........ :),pandora
Positive,"This app is an amazing app! I love! When I do my homework this is an awesome app because I cant live without music. When music is on, while I'm doing my homework it takes a half hour. And without music it takes me an hour. But I love to dance to it to. I LOVE MUSIC! :)",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora and its music choices,pandora
Positive,Frustrated that it only screws up on my kindle fire. Pc works fine. I love listening to music almost 24/7 but its annoying when you have to stop whatever you are doing and go close and reopen the app every few seconds. Hopefully I.T. is already working on the solution.,pandora
Positive,I loved it because when netflix is not working I just put this on and play games then my games stop working.,pandora
Positive,I like it a lot but I don't like how you can only skip a couple. songs at a time but besides that I love it oh and one more thing I don't like how you have you but your both date some kids under 13 want Pandora.,pandora
Positive,this app is a must have for all music lovers! it lets you create personalized stations and doubles as a social media type thing so you can listen to music and talk to friends that also use Pandora.,pandora
Positive,pandora is a great app for people who like music. i personally loved it so so so so so much,pandora
Positive,"I love this app. I can hear all the music I want all the time. I put in an artist and there is the music. I am in love with this app. Being as it's free, you have a lot of ads, but that's ok with me, because it doesn't stop the music.",pandora

Positive,Love Pandora! I splurged and spend the extra $9.95 to get rid of the commercials and it was a very satisfying move! Love having the extra music to play. I have a large music library but I am always finding new artists on Pandora that I would never have heard.,pandora
Positive,Absolutely great. I love music. hate ads. and hate when it times out but otherwise it is awesome. very good.,pandora
Positive,i have love pandora ever since the first time i have heard of the service. it is not for everyone i admit because not everyone is interested in find new artists that are almost identical to the songs/artists they love. but if you want to expand your harizons of artists and genres this is the perfect app for you.,pandora
Positive,"you'll love it. the only let down is that you need wifi for it to work. I use it a lot so its nice that they made it portable . I feel that if they tried a little harder, they could make so that you wouldn't need internet.",pandora
Positive,this app is great. I love it! You just put your favorite songs and then it plays songs that are like it! you can also like songs to play them again later or you can do thumbs down so it will skip the song you don't like and it will never play it again. Hope you like this app I loved it.,pandora
Positive,"Pandora introduces me to artists that are new to me and plays artists that I dearly love. Having my ""own channels"" is just the best. I use Pandora all the time - on my computer at home and at work, on my kindle, my phone, ipod - It is by far my favorite app.",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora so much. I love being able to listen to what I want to and skip the songs I don't like!

Positive,I love this app. I must say that I was shocked at the one star reviews but then I noticed they complained about ads. I don't have those problems because of Pandora one. I have not experienced it cutting off songs either. perhaps they have fixed those errors.,pandora
Positive,"Ok I love this app sure it stops ""SOMETIMES"" and that's only if you have put your electronic to sleep for a while so it thinks you fell asleep so it closes down and it got update not to long ago so try it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!please!!!!!!!!!!!!",pandora
Positive,I pay for Pandora One and I love it except that lately there has been an ad for using Pandora as an alarm. Please remove the ad. I pay for Pandora because I do not want ads.,pandora
Positive,I love being in charge of my music choices. I get to hear all sorts of new stuff too.,pandora

Positive,"Love it, the sound is fantastic. I never thought I would ever have it on my Fire.",pandora
Positive,"I used to LOVE Pandora! Friendly interface, great intuition to what music to play, etc... until NOW. For free radio, the cap is now 40 hours per month. Are you for real?? With all of the ads floating on this thing, suddenly, you want US to pay YOU $3.99??? Take a powder, Pandora!  I started using RADITAZ, people!!! Free radio, no ads, no limits, except on how many songs you can skip in one hour. Even has a carosel for songs. So, for now, my radio needs are taken care of via Raditaz or TuneIn Radio (free version). Pandora must be INSANE!!",pandora

Positive,"There is a free Pandora and there is a pay version. This app allows for both but if you don't have a subscription then expect commercials and popups. The yearly fee is worth the price; no apps, no ads and higher bitrate streaming.  I love Pandora and this app does it justice.",pandora
Positive,"I love music, so I decided to download this app. Not only has it allowed me to find different artists, but form a radio around them that I enjoy. The ads may be annoying, but you can update to premium, or just deal with the ads. Either way, it's still one of the best apps ever. Definitely recommend you getting this. Why not?

(mitsubishi lancer has plug to adapt phones to speakers)",pandora
Positive,Love the radio.Don't ever belive the 1or 2 star reviews cuz they are NOT true.All I know is that the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I want clean music but I got dirty music.But don't take my word for it.Lets just say its 100% free and a great radio.,pandora
Positive,"Pandora has been a companion for over nine months now, and I love it! It gives variety, and spice to life, from something to listen to while getting ready for work in the morning or working out in the gym. The latest to oldest music you can get your hands on. Thank you Pandora.",pandora
Positive,"I love the app, and when the kindle is plugged into the charger battery life isn't the problem. But after every two songs it plays the same annoying advertisement, I know that's how Pandora makes money. But come on, every two songs???",pandora
Positive,"I really love this app. Its free entrrtainment. I can listen to it at my house whenever I want to. I only with they'd let you skip as many times as you want, but that's to be expected. I also wish you could take it where there is no wifi.",pandora

Positive,Love Pandora listen to our all the time with Pandora there's no need for satellite radio limited commercials u get comedy from your favorite artist,pandora
Positive,"Music is my passion. I love many genres. However, it was difficult to know how to access new music. By creating my personal stations on Pandora, I have been introduced to many new artists that are now part of my musical world. I listen to Pandora every day, and am constantly surprised by new and beautiful songs and instrumentals. I then have new materials for creating my own Playlists, when I purchase music. Pandora is truly my Magic Box. What a gift! I subscribe by the month at minimal cost and it's worth every penny!",pandora
Positive,I LOVE THIS APP!!! It is amazing. You can make any station you want. Now that they have Thumbprint radio it is 10x better. Thumbprint radio is a station that only plays the songs that you have liked. It's amazing! I very much recommend this app!,pandora
Positive,"I've always loved Pandora. So its awesome to me. But sometimes it stops in the middle of nowhere. I'm like "" Really"". But I still love it and you should too.",pandora
Positive,This is my first time trying Pandora I really like it as soon as you touch the icon it pops up and it starts playing your music and I love that you have so many choices to choose from someone calls that call ends and it comes right back on I love that I know there's lots of other options and I haven't had it long enough to actually get into that an like read all about it I plan on doing that because you can actually like download songs and take them like anywhere with you so anywhere you're at you have your favorite music and I love that too try it out you'll love it too,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora you can get so many stations!,pandora
Positive,"Pandora has a genre of songs for any music lover and the best part is that it syncs to my smartphone, computer and Roku. If I sign in on what ever device, there is my list! Great selection of 70's rock, contemporary Christian and Cool Jazz.",pandora
Positive,"I love the variety of music that you can get with Pandora, and I especially love the fact that you can set the station to whoever your favorite artist is. This is so easy and convenient. Pandora has to be one of my all-time favorite applications.",pandora
Positive,I remember when this app first came out I freaking loved it it was the future but about three years ago I switched to Spotify and I've been there ever since. Anyways my friend brought up Pandora the other day so I thought I'd see what Pandora has been up to. What happened to them? Since I left Pandora I've gotten a promotion gotten a raise I've even got a new car and my home is even smarter now while Pandora has only updated the page look that's it a new shinny page.,pandora
Positive,I love the Pandora app. I can customize it to play the type of music that I want to listen to. I can see the name of the songs and who is singing them complete unlike listening to the radio. No call letters of the radio station being blared at me every minute...just music. You can select whatever stations that you like and give a thumbs up rating to the songs you love to keep them playing when you want to hear them in the future.,pandora
Positive,"I love love love Pandora & have used it for a few years now!! You can't get much better than free, but may consider upgrading to Pandora 1, especially since I use Pandora on my Kindle now & not just on my computer. The ad's that pop up are a bit annoying. When you play Pandora on your laptop or computer they may play a quick add after every 5-6 or sometimes as long as every 8-10 songs but on the kindle ad's pop up almost one after the other. If you hit the X to x out of one, another pops up almost immediately :/ mildly annoying but what can you expect for free, huh?",pandora
Positive,Love Pandora! Listen to it every day! Love that I can listen to different genre's of music depending on my mood.,pandora
Positive,"It's the perfect radio, I highly recommend having this app! Just watch out if u don't have unlimited data and its all good. Great for anyone who loves music.",pandora
Positive,"Who doesn't like Pandora? I've had it for almost 10 years so of course I had to add it to my new Kindle. Its FREE, and I love that I can have my own personal stations filled with music I like. I have a different station for every genre of music or mood I'm in. The thumbs up or down feature is really nice so I never have to hear a song I don’t like. Sure I could pay a fee to have the ads removed, but they only run about every 5th or 6th song and they’re short, not at all like on TV. So its worth it to me to have it for free.",pandora
Positive,Love listening to Pandora.,pandora
Positive,Easy and love it!,pandora
Positive,i love this it is so many different ways to listen to my kind of music so many selections of songs i created my own music station i wish there was a way you could use your station as a ringtone every time your phone rings a different song would play that would be amazing,pandora
Positive,"Love music!!! Love Pandora!!! The best music selection from oldies to today's greatest hits. Whatever my mood is Pandora will oblige. My brother is in a nursing home and wanted to listen to some Al Green. He is very old school, does not know anything about streaming or apps. As soon as I hit play, ""It was ON!"" My brother was singing, his roommate was singing, I was swaying and singing and even some of the nurses were swaying and singing. We had a BLAST!!! Nursing homes, are depressing places. But not that day; there was lot of spirit lifting going on. Thank you Pandora for having the perfect selection of music.",pandora
Positive,"This apps works great I can listen to music and play order and chaos online. It only stops because you have bad wifi and the commercial happen like every 7 songs to me ands there only 30 sec. I love it I can listen to all my favorite bands like The Ghost Inside, Parkway Drive, Carpathian, Stick to your Guns, and Killswitch engage. Get it who doesn't like FREE MUSIC",pandora
Positive,Love Pandora. I can listen to all types of music. I have at least 20 different styles of music and keep adding to when I hear something I like. I love to put it on shuffle when I am reading and listen to everything from meditative and instrumental to oriental and classical. Money well spent.,pandora
Positive,"Pandora is a great radio app.IMO much better than mobile Spotify!!Just type in a favorite artist or song & a station(s) will be created for you.As you rate the songs it will personalize the selections over time.I'm very happy I installed this app.Best thing is you can put your device in standby & the music still plays while saving battery life.Sound quality is FANTASTIC!!!  Enjoy.....Joe  Update:Noticed something that really pees me off!! In between songs or after ads I noticed songs listed as played that never played.You can't go back & play them,you can rate them.Just a bit aggravating when a sucky song comes on & a great song was skipped(not by me)!!! I still love the app!!(tunein is better though)",pandora
Positive,Love the wide variety of music and options!,pandora
Positive,I love the Pandora app!,pandora
Positive,"I'll attempt to not repeat what other reviews have said because there are nuances to Pandora that go beyond a convenient way to listen to the music you love.  The first thing I love is the way artists whose work is related to your favorites that you specify in channels are slipped in. I have discovered more musicians (and albums) that I would have never thought of on my own through that feature.  I also love that I can easily peruse a mini biography of the artist on any currently playing song, as well as features of the track itself. For example, listening to bassist Ron Carter's album titled Saguaro I discovered that the key features of the track for Piccolo include block chords on the piano and it's in a minor key. That information cues me to listen to those more carefully, which is a boon for musicians.  Another feature with which I am currently experimenting is the connect-to-facebook link that will not only alert friends to what I am listening to (although I have that hidden using facebook's privacy settings), but a monthly summary of my listening habits published on my timeline. That I do find useful!  The ads can be somewhat tiresome, but when I weight that minor inconvenience against the way Pandora's insertion of related music into my channel plays I can live with it with a smile. I have been exposed to a much wider range of music and artists than I ever was before Pandora came along, and this app is the key.  For the record this review is of version 4.1.2, which is the latest as of the date of this review. Features may change, obviously, so take this date and version into consideration as you read this review.",pandora
Positive,"I don't get all these comments about commercials every other song or other annoying things. This app works great for me on my Kindle Fire! I hardly ever hear a commercial- at most one per hour. I put in an artist that I love to be the station and so far it has given me a great variety. Also, I have not had problems with songs messing up when I am using another app- maybe the occasional tiny pause but that's it. Overall, I love this app and see no problems with it. :)",pandora
Positive,I absolutely love pandora. I use everyday and I don't mind the advertisements which is why I would pay for the no adds deal. Now since they update the get more skip buy watch a video is more pleasing to my enjoyment.,pandora
Positive,"I really enjoy Pandora very much. The only problem I've had is very occasional dead air for a minute here and there. I dislike the commercials. I have a Bluetooth Speaker and I get to bring Pandora with me wherever I go! Great for gatherings of any sort. I also use it as background for my Meditation classes. An amazingly huge amount of music, all genres, are available. Love it!",pandora
Positive,I love taking my music where ever I go! A lot easier than I thought it would be to find what I would like. Even the commercials aren't as bad as you find on the radio.,pandora
Positive,I love the new logo,pandora
Positive,"What's not to love? Pick your music choices, use shuffle for a mix up and there is your evening's background music.",pandora
Positive,"I love this app, I use it all the time! Great way to listen to the music you love. Love all the music selection",pandora
Positive,"I came on this site by accident and fell in love with it. I love to listen to music and there is so much to pick from it is hard to make up my mind. There is something for everyone from oldies from the 40's and 50's to current hits; instrumental to vocal to show songs. Most are free which does come with some ads which can be disconcerting because they come in when you least expect them, but there are not many. For anyone who likes music this is a good purchase.",pandora
Positive,"Very cool. I remember the days when you had to buy every piece of music you wanted to listen to, even if only once or twice. To have custom radio stations of your own to call on is lovely.",pandora
Positive,Love this app - use it to stream music which saves space on my devices as I don't have to download music.,pandora
Positive,"I got this app years ago and loved it right away. This app tailors the music to your liking. Unlike other music apps this one is don't just play the same genera it goes a level deeper and plays the same like arts. For example if you like rap music and select Ice Cube radio it won't just play gangsta rap music it will play west coast rap music because Ice Cube is a west coast rapper. The only downside is now this app is getting popular, being added to cars etc... so there are now commercials after 4-5 songs. You have to purchase it to be commercial free.",pandora
Positive,Listen to it all the time. Love forming my channels into the perfect mix. I like the random quality of a music mix when I don't know what is coming on next.,pandora
Positive,"Love this app. Works great on a Droid X. We have paid the monthly fee so we don't get commercials… That’s the way to go if you listen to Pandora for any length of time. It has lots of features. Share the track you are currently listening to. Sleep timer function to shut off automatically. Bookmark a current track you are listening to. Also, an option to buy the track if you like it that much. Also, you can touch the picture and another screen opens from behind and allows you information about the artist, features of the track and lyrics. THAT is very cool. Allows you to create as many stations as you like. If you don't like a song in your genre then ""thumb it down"" and it should never play again. I think what I love the most about Pandora is it plays songs LIKE the play list I create and I find new songs to love all the time.",pandora
Positive,Love to listen to it while cleaning.,pandora
Positive,For a while I loved Pandora after awhile I didn't use it as much today they sent me an email saying that the updated version had replay.I was so happy that I downloaded it.I went on and of course the replay button is not there,pandora
Positive,Love the diversity of music Pandora offers,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora it's so cool !!!!,pandora
Positive,"Pandora offers you the ability to create your own radio stations based on your musical style choices and the artists whose music you enjoy the most, and it's commercial free (if you pay the modest $36.00 US or so per year). Although you cannot at this time request a specific song, you'll get commercial-free tunes in any genre you choose. I can't recommend Pandora highly enough. If you're tired of normal radio, try Pandora. You'll listen to deep cuts from most of the artists you select, as well as the top hit tracks from the albums you love. It's almost like having your record collection with you wherever you go! Try it....I'd be really surprised if you don't love it. You define your stations however you'd like. Then, shuffle them to present yourself with a variety of your favorites no matter what they might be.",pandora
Positive,"Great service, works well with my Tap and Dot, love to be able to say Alexis, play some soft Jazz or Daft punk, and, I'm off to great music land. Love it all!",pandora
Positive,"I have left several reviews for this most bad. These were while I was using the free version. Ads cause it to buffer forever. Music was choppy. Timeouts happened often. After upgrading to Pandora one it's like a whole different app! Works flawlessly now, stations will download automatically to so even connection issues don't usually stop the music. It's so much faster now it's amazing. High quality audio works now. The selection and rating system is the best I have tried in any music app. Suggestions are usually very good. Sometimes despite constant thumbs down it keeps playing certain things but that's not too often. Browse feature in Pandora one is so good. This really is the app of your a music lover and if you really are a music lover you have to get the paid version, the difference is amazing!",pandora
Positive,Always love Pandora,pandora
Positive,"If you love music and discovering new music, Pandora is the single best reason for broadband access.  I listen to music every day. My musical tastes are diverse and I love to discover new artists. Until now, I've listened via my computer at home and work. I spend a fair amount of time on the road and I just purchased a smartphone primarily so I can listen to Pandora on the go.  I realize other people value different experiences and functions but, for me, this new phone and app added a large measure of joy to my mobile days.  As far as the app itself, I just started using it so I've got an impression, not an opinion. I need more time and data for that. However, it works similarly to the desktop app and browser versions. I haven't run across a big hurdle yet.",pandora
Positive,Works great on the Kindle Fire. I love being able to choose music I enjoy and hearing music from my favorite genres.,pandora
Positive,"Ok people. Hello I am Abigail. I LOVE??MUSIC. Ok? This should cost 5:99! Think of it this way, you get to listen to music for free and create your own stations!?????? But don't take my word for it, get it! PLZ??? I hoped you liked my review. P.S Dena filardi is not me it is my mom.",pandora
Positive,"I love that you can choose what type of music or the artist you want to hear. It will play for a long time and just in case there are no interruptions, the app will ask if you are still listening. At which point, you can choose to keep listening or stop until the next time. Furthermore, the sound is excellent. I never have any glitches, or issues that prevent me from listening. The ads in between several songs catch you off guard, but its like radio, without the characters. The ads come and go and you're back to listening to your music preference. I recommend this app to all music lovers for anytime use!",pandora
Positive,"When I first discovered Pandora, I absolutely loved it. However, over time, the ""stations"" became the same songs in the same rotation. I am somebody who listens to music 10+ hours a day. It got so that I could hear the next song coming before it played. While they started off well and had a great selection...I have migrated to Spotify. You can customize your playlist, and I have found some wonderfully obscure artists there. Pandora might become to streaming music what the VHS was to home video. It was good for its time, but easily replaced.",pandora
Positive,Love cuts out,pandora
Positive,"We love this!!! Select any music, set up multiple channels for your own person desires, set multiple channels for every style and 'LIKE' the songs being played and you get more of the same style or 'DISLIKE; and you get less of the artists or style you dislike. Its one of the easiest things we've ever had and so much nicer than radio. No commercials, non-stop music, and just what you want to hear. You can't get better than that! I even link my phone to my blue tooth in the car and listen to Pandora in the car as I drive across country...MUCH better than satellite radio, every day of the week.",pandora
Positive,"I love how easy it is to log in from all types of devices, whether my iPhone or school computer. The set lists I create have led me to hear all kinds of music that I'd otherwise not hear. The commercials pass along quickly so I don't mind them. Free music is good!",pandora
Positive,love their music etc,pandora
Positive,"I have stack and stacks of unused cds since discovering Pandora. I've made classical and Latin and alternative and celtic stations, just to name a few, and with a few ""like"" and ""dislike"" clicks on various pieces of music, my stations play a wonderful blend of all the things I like best. I love the way one can add variety to any given station by suggesting different artists, composers or compositions. Pandora has taken the hours and hours of work out of making the perfect personal blends of music for any occasion. Highly recommend.",pandora
Positive,"so ive been trying to install Pandora on my Kindle but it wont let me. I have the app on my other device and love it so I wanted to put it on my kindle, but insteadbpf installing the app it says ""error"" and ""please try again later"". if anyone knows how to download it on a kindle. or of any app similar to Pandora id.appreciate it. thank you. :)",pandora
Positive,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZE!!! I love it so much! YAY FINALLY AN APP THAT I CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC WHILE PLAYING A GAME WITH NO SOUND! I love how you can go to a game and just play it while the song is going! Only problem is the skip limit. Sometime when Work is playing I'm just like ""SKIP!"" And then u ppl won't let me :(. So I have to go to another station. But that's just minor! ITS A AMAZING!!!",pandora
Positive,"I love picking my music , not many commercials",pandora
Positive,"Love me some PANDORA!!! I've learned all kinds of things about music history (which I love.) It's the only music source I have, so it really means a lot to me to have it at my fingertips, and take with me wherever.",pandora
Positive,"I enjoy making and listen my own listed stations. The music of 70""s and 80""s is what I grow up on and just love the ballard and the message in the songs.",pandora
Positive,i listen to this at work i love it,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora and have loved Pandora for many, many years.",pandora

Don Stone,pandora
Positive,"I use this when I'm working out to give me motivation. The advertising can be a bit annoying, but the ability to customize your stations and seek out your favorite music is wonderful. You can also just let them surprise you. I also love that you can connect with other to check out their music.",pandora
Positive,Esp great for long car rides-love comedy channels.,pandora
Positive,"I love the variety of the music. I have 12 different personal categories and get a beautiful mix when I shuffle them. It makes me think I don't need to buy cds anymore! When I want to hear one kind of music I choose that category, but I usually enjoy the mix. You can even customize the categories you choose so it's more suited to your own personal tastes. I have added and subtracted specific artists or songs from the categories, so it's really what I enjoy!",pandora
Positive,I love that I can listen to what I want and that I can have variety in my stations that coincide with my mood or what I am doing.,pandora
Positive,Always loved Pandora . I use it constantly and have regrets down loading the app. Now have it on multiple devices,pandora
Positive,"What a treasure , All my favorite music purched on 78 rpm, on 45 rpm. 8 track etc. It is all here and I love it.",pandora
Positive,I love the option of free choice. I can either listen to their choices or make a playlist of what I like. I have diverse tastes and am glad to be able to have my favorites availabe for me.,pandora
Positive,I use this app all the time. I love having my own custom playlist!,pandora
Positive,if you love music you gotta get pandora it have alot of great station and teaches itself to learn the music you like and want to hear,pandora
Positive,"You will spend a lot of ""data"" using Pandora if you are away from home/wireless. Always good to buy songs from Amazon and download to your phone as I do. Find those songs on Pandora/Wifi while free, and you can buy them very cheap on Amazon... here. A new song a month;.50 cents? something to look forward too. Save your songs on your phone; Then put on the head phones at home or at the doctors office or walking, and read the Bible or the LA Times or new books like author ""Chris Perez, ""To Selena with Love"" ! Its free after download; no use of data! You saved it on your phone! It's yours!",pandora
Positive,I hav had Pandora for several years it is the first time I hav it on my phone...I hav always loved it...it came in handy when I didn't hav Wi-Fi but had phone service...??,pandora
Positive,it has all ur favorite songs that u love trust me I listen to Pandora every day and if u listen to music all the time then this is for u and it is free,pandora
Positive,My husband loves loves loves Pandora. He would listen to it 24 hours a day if he could. He loves the fact he can listen to his favorite artists only. He can't say eniugh good about Pandora!!,pandora
Positive,"Pandora for my tablet is just what I wanted. New things I haven't heard mixed with old things I love from the same genres, plus lyrics, and adaptive playlists. Love it!",pandora
Positive,I love this app. There is only one thing that is really makes me mad is that sometimes it plays artists I didn't download. But just get it it's really good but just that one thing I'm not trying to make you not buy it.,pandora
Positive,"""I love my Pandora!"" Radio will never be the same for me. I actually have thought of getting the Ad-Free Pandora One, but am not ready to pay $4.99 a month yet. I'm such a cheapskate. I probably will once I get more gadgets that will allow me to use Pandora. Once that happens it's totally worth it because your linked to your own account no matter what gadget your using at the time. Go Pandora !",pandora
Positive,"I love this app. You can move around on the carousel and even read books while listening to your favorite music. The only thing I don't like so far, is that I have been notified that they will charge for any amount of listening over 40 hours/mo. I don't think that is right, because I already have an account with Pandora through our Netflix account. So it should be covered already. I know it imported all my ""stations"" from that account. If you have an account with Netflix, be aware of this. It might be a new policy. I don't know.",pandora
Positive,I have been listeneing to Pandora for years and just love it,pandora
Positive,Listening to Pandora has exposed me to music I love that I wouldn't have found any other way.,pandora

Positive,"How very wonderful to be able to listen to whatever kind of music you're in the mood for,whenever you want it. Love it !",pandora
Positive,WOW I LOVE IT! Free music! No limits! The only thing that's bad are the ads but those only come in after like SEVEN songs and there is only one or two. You must get it if you love music. Even my daughter loves it she can listen to disney songs ALL day. It's perfect for when your trying to clean to.,pandora

Positive,"I liked it but I would put on the Taylor swift radio it gives me I'm sexy and I know it besides that I love listening to it while I play a app if it would let me put four and a half stars I would! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING. if you disagree how about you make your own review and don't judge mine by its cover ""I liked it but..."" Thanks Again!",pandora
Positive,I love it. I can put on a station on the 50's music and it plays songs that I love and have forgotten about! So glad I downloaded it's!,pandora
Positive,"Free music, streaming while I do chores, make phone calls, handle the kids, or whatever else the day might hold! I can pick the kind of music I want to play, tweek it by adding more artist / songs I like, & then choosing thumbs up and down for each song. Furthermore, I don't like the song I can skip it. LOVE LOVE LOVE! My children love it too!",pandora
Positive,"Love it. It has variations which it let hear music from different decades in the same station,",pandora
Positive,"Love this, I did get to try at a discount for my honest review but will keep at the regular price! What a selection and I love all the choices, I listen all the time & am looking into speakers, I can play at night & not disturb the neighbors upstairs!",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora and have listened to it for years. Great song selection.,pandora
Positive,We love this app! I play the dinner time station at meals time to set a nice cheerful mood and the lullaby stations to help settle my kid down for bed.,pandora
Positive,"I loved my Pandora channels UNTIL THE LAST UPDATE! Now, nothing works. I deleated the app and reinstalled, signed in and the thing is still FUBAR! Dammit! Do I wait and see if they bother to fix the problem, or, choose a different app and try to recreate my old but perfect listening stream? Ugh, not happy!",pandora
Positive,"I Love listening to my favorite types of music and favorite musicians. Pandora gives you the choice, to listen to the musicians you choose and what type of music you wish. There are music stations on Pandora for everyone's taste.",pandora

Positive,Love to listen to this app. Has all kinds of kids channels too,pandora
Positive,"Great app, I love being exposed to new music based on artists I already enjoy. With your phone and a bluetooth speaker, you have a stereo anywhere and can create your own radio stations. I was never able to use it when traveling in other countries, which is frustrating, but I do understand about licensing rights, so I realize it's an unavoidable nuisance.",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora and love the variety. I only wish I could make my own stations with certain music like a playlist and the alarm doesn't work well,pandora
Positive,"Pandora is my go-to app for my radio needs. I love that I can pick playlists based on my favorite artists, and then discover new artists through that playlists. The app truly is tailored to my needs.",pandora
Positive,I like how it can pick the music that I love to listen to.,pandora
Positive,"50+ yr old un-hip white guy here who generally shys away from new technology, but I'm hooked on Pandora. I love just about any kind of music and love that Pandora predicts what I will like based on what I already told it I like. I'm now a Pandora junkie!",pandora
Positive,love Pandora! free music without static or numerous commercials and the ones you do have you can skip fairly quickly,pandora
Positive,"Love it, listen to anything you want.",pandora
Positive,Love it. I buy it to avoid the ads. I'm very satisfied with Echo. The only problem I have is how echo doesn't hear me when music is playing. It has to be turned down low and then it can hear me. But that's a minor problem that I can live with.,pandora
Positive,"Love it. It works even better than the one on my PC. The tablet app is so easy to use and makes listening to my favorite songs very enjoyable. I have 5 ""radio"" stations setup and switching between them give me the songs for those different moments. I don't even need the DELUXE version since the short 30 second adds are far less than any radio. I think they ""interrupt"" less because I rate each of the songs as I listen and relax. WELL WORK LOADING.",pandora
Positive,"I really like this app. I have a Pandora account and now that I have my Kindle Fire, I tend to listen to Pandora much more than I used to. I especially like to listen to my selected music tastes while working on a project or just reading on my Kindle. I find it very relaxing. This is one free app that I get a lot of use out of and I just love it.",pandora
Positive,"I have iHeart on my phone, but I prefer Pandora. I love being able to make new stations based on artist, genre, or even song. We listen to Pandora on our Roku most every day. Now if we could all just agree on what station to put on!",pandora
Positive,Love being able to hear my favorite artists and then get new ones of the same genre. Multiple stations for multiple moods. They even have a special station for your pets?,pandora
Positive,Hubby loves his music and Pandora is the best.,pandora
Positive,Love Pandora. I can listen to anything I want to and mix it up. Some days I listen to piano and classical. Other days I listen to pop or retro plus many more stations.,pandora
Positive,Absolutely LOVE Pandora!! One of my absolute favorite ways to listen to music. You pick your song and it just seems to know what you want to listen to. It's super user friendly and spot on with my selections. Very pleased with this app. I have a Galaxy S6.,pandora
Positive,"Pandora has helped me learn about and share new music for years, now. I love their service. I use it all the time. Their radio feature throws less curveballs than the other services I've tried. One of the other services kept trying to get me to listen to Kanye on my Taylor Swift station. I'm not even kidding.",pandora
Positive,"I prefer spotify and google all access or even mog. But since my subscriptions ran out and mog and all access is not on the app. I am using pandora for the first time. All though I don't want to use it because I don't have a subscription, so I just listen to 42 kbps or whatever the quality is for the song. The songs it plays are accurate, they are the songs I want to listen to. I love this app",pandora
Positive,Pandora is by far the best music app out there. It has music that none if the other apps do. My favorite is hair bands. I love Pandora!,pandora
Positive,"Pandora is a great concept, and nicely executed. I learned how to use it and am now addicted! I really like the idea of encountering random tracks that fit into a self-created 'station' idea that I didn't choose directly. I'm still learning how to use its management capabilities, but I've come to use it quite a lot, as over the air radio in non-urban areas (heck, even in urban areas!) leaves a lot to be desired these days. Try it, learn it, you'll love it!",pandora
Positive,"I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from. There is no cost to listen and enjoy unless you choose to upgrade. I like to be able to listen to a variety of Gospel music such as Country/Southern, Black Gospel and some more modern. It allows me to select, and then just run the shuffle of music to get the variety. Also I like to use it at school at times in my K2 class, using Christian Childrens music in our Christian school.",pandora
Positive,"When I was younger I would only really listen to whatever people happen to give to me, which was usually pop stuff given to me by my older sister. Now that I'm branching out more and finding my own music I find pandora to be pretty great for new suggestions. Music by people I'd never heard of before or even songs that I loved but hadn't heard in forever and didn't know or forgot the names of have been suggested to me and there's nothing quite like finding a long lost song to make your day. :)",pandora
Positive,I love that I can type in a band that I love and it finds others similar for me! makes it alot easier to find music you enjoy and it has the thumbs up or down so that if you really like a song just hit the thumb up and it will play songs similar to its type and if you don't then it the thumbs down! You can add as many bands to the same radio channel as you want and it will shuffle all of those bands for you. I just love it!,pandora
Positive,I LOVE AND CANNOT REALLY EXIST - EXAGGERATING - without it. Live in a rural community with few stations and few options.I selected my last phone because it plays Pandora so well.,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora and listen to it all the time, on my computer, my Ipad and especially my Sonos system. For the latter, it is pretty seamless and the ads in the free version are not terribly intrusive. The sound quality is great, and I usually (but not always) get music I enjoy.  That said, Pandora seems a bit confused about what I call my Uplifting music station. Most of the time it works great. I get my favorite kinds of music consisting of Kirtan, Irish piano riffs and some beautiful, moving classical music. But at least once a day, my happy reverie is invaded when suddenly I am bombarded with loud and offensive rap music such as Moki complete with swear words. What the @#$*&^?? I always give these a thumbs down and the specific song goes away, only to have some other piece pop its head in the following day or even immediately after! Makes me wonder what it is about my other song choices that feeds into Pandora's algorithm fooling it into picking something so off the wall. Just curious - and mildly annoyed. And yeah, it is free so I give it ALMOST 5 stars.",pandora
Positive,"and/or jumping rope. I love the music of course..but THOSE FREQUENT ADVS. are a pain. I have to stop running..click the corner ""X"" and then it takes some time for the song to continue...sometimes I have to close the app. then re-open I know it's FREE so I do understand. The frequency of advs. DOES make me think about subscribing for $4/monthly if that means NO ADVS. EVER! But the variety of music is impressive and again--IT'S FREE!",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora and I wish I would have heard about it years ago.,pandora
Positive,"Great selection of music. Pick your favorite artist and listen with very little interruptions. Short commercials are ok. I bought a Jam speaker and blutooth from my iPhone, working outside bring your music with you. This is a great way to listen to the music you love.",pandora
Positive,"I love, love, love Pandora! I use it when I teach exercise classes, when I workout, cook, clean etc. My children love the Kidzbop station and frequently have dance parties. I like that I can play it on my phone, tv, iPad etc.",pandora
Positive,it always on in my office love it,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora. It plays in the background while I do other things on my laptop or my Kindle. I can have Pandora playing on my laptop while I work in the kitchen or do household chores. You pick the artists you like, Pandora plays those and similar artists. I often hear something from an artist I never heard before, like it, and buy the CD for my collection.",pandora
Positive,what i listen to when doing work in the yard or upstairs house work. Love it,pandora
Positive,"I am addicted to Pandora. It has a wonderful assortment of old time music. I love the Big Band, New Orleans Jazz, Boogie Woogie, 40's, 50's, as well as classical, classic Christmas was WONDERFUL, also old country(Patsy Cline and others). Please stay as great as you are. I fear this world is not going to know what real music is anymore if you change.",pandora
Positive,"It's AWESOME. Some of the secretary's at work would listen to Pandora on their computers. So I decided to download the app to my Kindle Fire. I needed a little pick me up the other day. I love listening to Chris Tomlin and some of the other Christian Artist's. What a blessing! I can carry the music with me from room to room, outside or in the car. That's why I've rated the app 5 stars.",pandora
Positive,"I grew up with radio and love the reduced advertising and great genres that can be created on Pandora. I'm not really one to use ear buds since I'm an artist and need to be unencumbered when I'm working. Just turn on the computer, plug in speakers and ""Bob's your uncle""!",pandora
Positive,Love it. Awesome app.,pandora
Positive,Love how I can look for one artist and Pandora finds comparable music to listen to! My go to at work for sure.,pandora
Positive,"I do love Pandora but do have an issue with them. I designed my own 'stations' and Pandora inserts music on my comedy station and vice versa (you get my drift..) so I have to hit the thumbs down sign each time.. Well, they keep doing this on all my 'stations'. I know I'm being picky but it does get annoying when 4+ times in a row I have to hit the thumbs down sign. We only get so many dislikes at a time..",pandora
Positive,Love pnor,pandora
Positive,"I love jazz and cannot tolerate rap and hip hop. Pandora has every genre of music from country to opera. I listen to John Coltrane, Michael Buble and an ocassional Fleetwood Mac and Elton John if I feel like it. The ads are a little troublesome but I don't mind because I get to hear the channels I chose. If you don't want the ads you can upgrade to Pandora One for an extra few bucks.",pandora

Positive,Love smooth Jazz,pandora
Positive,"I love PANDORA with the reason, I am fond of Music, every step of the way, I on the PANDORA. It's give me ENERGY and HAPPINESS, so my work done so easy, unbelievable. Some Music get me going dancing, in the car or home, make me awake in the night driving.Oh, PANDORA IS GREAT BELIEVE ME.",pandora
Positive,"I pay for commercial free access - it is great to create your own stations to fit any mood with songs you have never heard, songs you have not heard in a very long time, and all commercial free - I LOVE IT",pandora
Positive,"I love having access to music from my Kindle, it makes reading even more enjoyable for me! No issues with the app. Downloading was quick, it runs smoothly with no errors.",pandora
Positive,"This app is NOW great! The first time I got this app I could not get it to work well at all. I could get a few songs to play and then it froze up. All I had was a blue Pandora screen. I deleted the app for 3 days. Today I loaded Pandora app again. Now it works perfectly the way I want, alot of music that I love made up into stations that I can play any time. Plays on my Kindle Fire HD in the back- ground as I do other web searches,etc. Wow this is great.",pandora
Positive,"I really did not think it would follow my tastes, as the first artist I entered was lutenist Nigel North. Lovely, I was transported to the world of early music for a full afternoon while I painted from my Kindle. It has nicely followed my next entry, composer Nikolai Korsakov. Not a problem. Another afternoon of Russian romantic music, orchestral. How did I live without this?",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora. I listen to lots of different music, especially latin salsa, bachata, merengue. I would give it a 5 except that in each venue, the list of music is limited. You keep hearing the same songs over and over. Pandora really needs to offer more songs.",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora. I have the premium package but the free version is good too. I love the ability to have customizable music by genres. This was especially a wonderful app during Christmas when I could THUMBS UP or THUMBS DOWN any Christmas selection I liked or disliked. When Christmas rolls around again, Christmas station will be even better. I love a variety of music and Pandora IS the app for music lovers.",pandora
Positive,"What else can I say, I absolutely love Pandora Radio. Once you create a channel that you like, I can listen to it for hours at a time! It knows exactly what I love and plays more of it! Love Love Love!",pandora
Positive,"I love my Pandora. Such versatility, wide range of music selections. Love being able to customize stations and preferences. Also love being able to train my programs by giving tracks a thumbs up or thumbs down. I don't really listen to the radio anymore....just my iTunes and Pandora!",pandora
Positive,"Not a day goes by that I don't play my favorite artists on Pandora. Whether on my Kindle, my cell or my laptop Pandora is always there playing what I enjoy listening to and not what someone else likes. Even with the rare commercial breaks, its ok, because, it's RARE. I LOVE MY PANDORA!",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora the music is great you can have more than one station. You have made this station affordable for people who can't afford to pay for a station thanks,pandora
Positive,"Love the amount of songs available in all music genres. Hate that it takes forever to yea or nae your favorite songs while setting up your favorite station.",pandora
Positive,"Overall, Pandora has a seemingly infinite array of music available for playing and I love to discover new music and artists that I might like. I really find the fine-tuning feature helpful because it allows you to obtain a more specific music taste. Thanks to Pandora, I now regularly listen to Melanie Martinez, Marina and The Diamonds, Lana del Rey, and many other amazing artists I'd never think I'd discover. It's a great app for those who wish to expand their personal music library.",pandora
Positive,"Always loved Pandora on my desktop - so glad to not be tied down to one location. Love bringing Pandora from room to room or out on vacation, where I'm not familiar with the local radio stations.",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora and always have, it's never crashed on me and it doesn't take as much data as all of the other music streaming apps.",pandora
Positive,Love being able to a wide range of music any time I am in the mood.,pandora
Positive,"The app is fantastic. I love listening to music when I'm driving or working; however, it is very buggy. I have yet to listen to the app for a solid hour without issues. Usually, it just needs restarted, so it's not a serious problem, but it does get annoying.",pandora
Positive,I love using Pandora!!!! Love hearing the music I choose!!!,pandora
Positive,"Pandora is the only app that I can be on for more than 2 hours!!! I love how you are able to communicate with people with the same interests as you, plus leave comments on your fave songs!! It plays all my favorite music!!! Nothing bad to report, just that leaving comments on other people's profiles might not go through... so beware!!! But other than that, best app ive ever had!!!!   - Directioner4eva",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora. The site, anyway. I can listen to almost anything I want there, and on the site, there's nothing that threatens my computer. The app, on the other hand, is highly invasive and has a virus on a file. I will keep using the site, but I'll be looking for another app for my Kindle.",pandora
Positive,I LOVE Pandora radio. No complaints whatsoever.,pandora
Positive,Love it. So nice at Christmas time and love my oldies. Doo wah Diddy.,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora and all the stations I'm able to have at my fingertips anywhere! I have to have my music when I'm doing something. I love that I can listen to it on my Kindle fire HD and move it from room to room with ease and it sound great. Before I could only listen to it only at certain times and hauling my laptop from room to room was frustrating. Pandora is great and I tell people about it whenever I have the opportunity plus I'm content with the free version. The ads aren't any trouble for me.,pandora
Positive,"Is a great music app, and I love that it has international artists as well. Just sometimes I don't really care so much for the selections chosen for you when you create a station around a certain artist, as sometimes I don't want to hear someone else.",pandora
Positive,"Simply love this app. Am able to create stations based on my interests! I have run the gamut of stations; ie, favorite artists, showtunes, classical, oldies, musicals (contains music from productions, artists, Broadway; example: Momma Mia & Phantom), classical! Unbelievable that is a free app! Doesn't matter that one cannot specify songs as the offerings are so fantastic. Able to input opinion of songs through thumbs up/thumbs down. I have this on my Kindle Fire HD.",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora, it's great to be able to listen to my favorite music at any time.  I lo",pandora
Positive,I LOVE Pandora! I like the fact that I create my own stations using my favorite artists as a guideline. Using the thumbs up and down I can control what artists get played more often and who never gets played again. I really have found myself turning off the television and listening to my favorite station because it has been customized for me and plays all good songs! You really can't loose!,pandora
Positive,"Love this concept. Lots of trouble on my Amazon fire phone. There's no way I could ever even think about upgrading to the no commercials. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. Why can't we all get Pandora's full benefits? If it is not for all phones, just say so and be done with us! You should be able to accommodate Fire phones, others have found a way. You are dragging your feet and we would like some service!",pandora
Positive,"It's a free app, but I don't like my songs being cut off or my commercials in Spanish. I love the choices Pandora pics for me. I have found some new groups I love.",pandora
Positive,"Pandora is great because you hear artists you wouldn't have otherwise, based on your preferences. I would recommend it to anyone that loves music and thrives on finding new artists and genres. My only problem with it is that there are more ads than there used to be and the price of a subscription to get rid of the ads has gone up. However, it is only $4.99/mo, which is affordable and worth the expense.",pandora
Positive,"This app is so wonderful! I love being able to hear the music and comedy routines that I love without buying anything and without putting up with a D.J. It is just the music I love. I have my oldies and the most current.  The only problem I am having is the wake up to music feature. I may not understand it yet. I just got an alarm with no music.",pandora
Positive,I've always loved Pandora! Love how they can figure out our tastes and especially now that we can skip back to the previous song! :),pandora
Positive,"Love it wish they would play the forties stuff, love the old war years songs, even though I wasn't there...",pandora
Positive,"Whether I'm cleaning, driving, or need to help my little guy relax...this is my go to app! There is a station for every mood! Love it!",pandora
Positive,"My much beloved spouse likes Pandora very much. He uses it a lot and is quite pleased with it. If he is pleased, then I am delighted. Very very nice.",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora because it is like public radio, but you can choose what you like and if you don't like a song you can just skip it or dislike it and it skips the song and will not play the song again on the station you disliked it on. Ads aren't too often every 7 or so songs and after skips. If you hats ads you can always get Pandora one, which gives you additional skips, No ads, and on the website you can choose a custom background for $3.99 a month. One downside is I can't use the alarm clock feature because battery life on my kindle fire is really bad on wifi even on standby. I love the sleep time because sometimes I need something to turn off my music if I do fall asleep to help save me from being waken up to turn off the ""loud music"". I don't use the station shuffle much, but it is a cool feature which plays a different station after each song and you can go back to one station play by clicking the station you want.",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora. I have to say I like it better than any other music source. One can 'make' a radio station and listen to just the music you want. Anything you don't like, give it a thumbs down and you don't hear it again. After a period of time, it's all the stuff one likes to hear. Did I say I love it? Also have it on all 4 computers as well as my cell phone. It don't get any better. Life is good!",pandora
Positive,Great helps me keep in touch with all the music I love. From generation to generation and different genres,pandora
Positive,I LOVE IT LIKE SPOTIFY.,pandora
Positive,"Pandora allow you to somewhat pick the music that you like. Somewhat being that if you like a song and indicate as a thumbs up you will get more of the style of music. You don't really get to pick the music you pick the style or similar music. If you do it long enough most of the music that you here will be ones that you like. Since I have loaded Pandora I have almost never turn on television but I do love music. It is simple to figure out easy to understand all you have to do type in a favorite artist or style of music and let it pick the music, all you have to do is give it a thumbs up ( I like it) or thumbs down (I don't like it) It is worth the download. Try it",pandora
Positive,"It never ceases to amaze me as to how this little Kindle can actually get great music for me, all at the touch of a button! The Kindle enables me to do such fun things, but I especially love being able to carry music with me into any room of my house. The selections played are wonderful, and is just another reason I'm so glad I purchased a Kindle. Pandora is simply amazing and such fun to use!",pandora
Positive,"Loved it but at the time, I had limited Gs so could not play it much. Now I have Slacker, not as good but it will do.",pandora
Positive,"In the area I live, finding a good Contemporary Christian radio station can be difficult. Everything is either a little too country or a little too pop sounding. What I like most about Pandora is that I can tailor it to my taste and don't have to sit through a few songs I don't particularly like to hear one I do like. And I really enjoy that I can create a few different stations to go with the mood I am in on any given day. And if I really love a song I hear it is easy to purchase. I would rate Pandora more stars if possible.",pandora
Positive,"I recently was given a Kindle Fire for my birthday and it had Pandora already loaded on it. Since January, I have been listening to so much GREAT music. I can personalize it many ways according to mood, time of day, etc. The selections that come forth are brilliant and I love the notion of having music at my fingertips whenever I want. Well done, Pandora!!",pandora
Positive,"I LOVE Pandora............have it on my phones, TV, Computer etc. I love the option to download and specify certain artists and songs..........creating my own playlist if you will.",pandora
Positive,"I have discovered so many great new artist using this program and my appreciation for music has grown! Plus, it's not just music. There are multiple comedy channels you can discover and that's all my husband and I listen to on long car drives. We love it and I definitely recommend it to any one with a tablet, computer, smart phone, etc. You wont regret it! It is my favorite app!",pandora
Positive,Love all the songs i grew up iwth :D,pandora
Positive,"If you love music this is YOUR app! First, the app is free and so is the music! If your into singers like Taylor Swift or Demi Lovato it gives it you! Or if you like rock bands like Metallica or Nirvana they have it too! All you have to do is search the band/singer name and it will come up. And also if it's your favorite song, you can like it and it will play at times. I love this app and so will you!",pandora
Positive,I love that I can find the exact music I love to hear with very little interruptions and it plays anywhere. I listen to all the time,pandora
Positive,"I still love using Pandora, but I'm growing tired of commercials and stoppages",pandora
Positive,"I love this app however, I DESPISE the commercials! Yet how can Pandora pay the bills if I don't pony-up for a subscription for commercial free listening...but doesn't that defeat the idea of free internet radio? Consequently, I'll endure the limited interruptions...it's better than FM. I can select the style of music I'm feeling without having to slit my wrist from being subjected to the no talent, lack of common sense, Bieber.",pandora
Positive,"Thanks Pandora for being a free app. It is really inspiring to be able to choose the music I love, which helps an accomplishing artist like myself to stay motivated. I play you both on my awesome sound system on my 27inch monitor, as well as on my tablet. I use my quad core computer and monitor n my studio, and my tablet when I am traveling around doing paintings and drawings of clients.  You're a great help to an artist, please stay a free app for me, You're and awesome group! Julie",pandora
Positive,I love it. I really like how you can type in an artist's name and hear their music and music similar to that artist. Also you can change artist at will.,pandora
Positive,"It's free everywhere - on my phone, in my car, on my TVs, tablets, computers at work, at home. Of course the ads are a bit bothersome but it's free. Sometimes a song comes on I am not fond of so I skip it - can't do that on the radio and it's still free. I love Pandora. The variety available just by entering an artist's or group's name is amazing - even somewhat obscure names will bring a good mix of music in that genre or style.",pandora
Positive,"Love this app, great music",pandora
Positive,Love setting up my own likes and groups.,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora more than any other app i have! They give me everything i want in music! They are totally Awesome. You should try this app! I love them!!!,pandora
Positive,I am a music lover music makes me feel better when I'm mad happy sad and so and I love to listen to music when I do homework or I'm cleaning or when I'm bored and this app helps me listen to all my favorite songs for free I love how I can type in an artist like one direction or katy Perry and other artist I love this app and works really good so I love it very much it's awesome and that's why I would give it ten stars ifi could and take it from a teenage music lover I love this app,pandora
Positive,"Love all the channels...... especially Shuffle because I can pick stations to shuffle. I have Pandora on my phone, computer, TV and tablet. My favorite station is Pop 80's and a couple that I created. Loggins and Messina and Peter Frampton.....",pandora
Positive,"We love making our own stations - like Disney for the kids. This way, they can listen to all the music from their favorite movies. Plus, mom & dad can have a station too. As many as you want with different genres. We can play it on our tablets, phones and TV. It's a win-win when cleaning the house or just wanting some peaceful background music.",pandora
Positive,"I love that you are able to create your own genre stations, just don't like all the commercials. I love that its free.",pandora
Positive,"Love it! Personalized listening. Use this in my car pretty much exclusively - beats paying for Sirius XM because I have more control of what I hear and don't hear. Also beats all of the commercials and chit chat on local stations. Uses very little cellular data which is excellent. I have the free version; there are commercials, but I don't mind as they are way less frequent than commercial radio.  I no longer have 15 minutes of talk during my 20 min drive to work -- can listen to more upbeat stuff to wake me in the morning, podcasts for interesting stuff, and more mellow favorites as I de-stress on the drive home.",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora. It is very nice being able to listen to only music that you like. I originally subscribed to Pandora on my computer and really don't plan on using it on my Kindle. If there is any downside to Pandora it is that there is not as much variety as I would like. By that I mean that if you put an artist on Pandora you may only have a small number of that artist's songs available. Therefore you may have to listen to 5 or 10 songs by that artist over and over.,pandora
Positive,Pandora is free if you don't mine once in a while a no irrating comercial. I love it. Plus you can tell them what you like and don't like with the thumbs up or thumbs down. Plus this app give you more that what is on your DVD player. It tell you information about the artist. I love my music and I have many different types I like to listen to. This Pandora app keeps up with all of my likes and dislikes. It is like my personal disk jocky without the mouth and chatty conversations.,pandora
Positive,"I've been using Pandora for years and I have I on all my devices, my Optimus and iPad. I have tried other music app as well, but I always end up going back to Pandora. I really love the recent changes they've made to it like the ability to add variety to your stations and being able to preview and listen to new albums before they're released. If you love a variety of music and want to be able to actually choose some your own selections of songs, you'll love this app. Pandora is one of those apps that you absolutely need o have on your device if you love music. There's no way you'll be disappointed with it.",pandora
Positive,"Every song I even think about listening to is on there! It's like listening to the radio but with limited commerical interruption. I have my favorite stations I can have and delete the ones, I don't want. Every genre is represented and you also can shuffle between radio stations. I am totally in LOVE!!!",pandora
Positive,"I love it when I can't sleep or want to hear new things. I use Pandora mostly on my Kindle and never on my phone. It is miraculous how you can tailor a station to what you want to hear and are exposed to like music. I have a lot of music downloaded to my Kindle, but use Pandora when I have a wi-fi connection.",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora! It is free ( at least for now tho' I heard a rumor that they were going to start charging, at which time I'll cancel) and you are able to bookmark songs and groups, build a list of ""stations"" to listen to, and change and alter items according to your listening habits. My taste runs pretty eclectic from an Eddie Cochran station to Mumphord and Sons. So give a trial run and I think you'll become a Pandora fan.",pandora
Positive,I love Pandora! its my favoriot and most visited app. the only problem is you can only skip 6 times.,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora and listened through the occasional commercials for free for years. Recently, I finally discovered how totally cheap a subscription is (just a couple of bucks a month!) and signed up as a paying customer. No more ads --- wish I'd not been so cheap and done it years ago.  Only down side: my girlfriend likes the availability of lyrics and has to sing along...",pandora
Positive,"I love love loved Pandora because I could listen free to music all the time on my tablet. I got the update, wondering what would be different, and now I can only listen to 40 hours of free music on a mobile device. I can still listen on my computer but my tablet has better quality speakers. Now I don't listen to Pandora as much as I used to and that makes me upset. If I had unlimited free music like I used to I would give it 5 stars. You can pay four dollars a month to remove ads and have unlimited music but I not paying money for the subscription",pandora
Positive,"Pandora makes listening to music such a pleasure. It isn't perfect, occasionally it will skip forward in the middle of a song I like and it can be repetitive with songs but once you start listening to it you can barely stand commercial radio. Unlike satellite radio you can set a station with any artist or song you want and a year subscription costs nearly the same as a month of satellite or you can get the free version and listen to their occasional annoying commercials. There is no talk or sports radio on Pandora but I love being able to choose the stations by songs or artists I like. You can also bookmark songs you like and buy them on iTunes which is convenient. They also tell you why they choose to play a certain artist on a station you choose although I don’t find their choices always make sense. For example I made a Coldplay station and it kept playing big band music particularly Bing Crosby. They gave some convoluted reason about percussions and rhythms but if you eant to listen to Coldplay you don't want to listen to song after song of big band music. And it would literally play song after song of big band music, I found this very strange. I resolved the issue by choosing a Coldplay song I like and making a station from that instead. Now I hear the music I’m interested in listening to from Coldplay and bands who actually have a similar style. The thumbs up/down feature rocks and so does the skip. For $36 a year you can’t beat it. Music you (mostly) love and no commercials. My husband listens to commercial radio a lot and he is constantly singing radio ad jingles without even realizing he’s doing it and it drives me nuts!",pandora
Positive,I just love pandora.,pandora
Positive,"Being from Europe I was disappointed, Spotify Music App. Has every music you will love, from every country. Pandora is for not for a European American, like me. I like different stations, I do listen to American Music, Pandora has also South American Music, which is not for me.",pandora
Positive,How don't u people like this?! I love this app. plays song I luv and I think I found a great radio,pandora
Positive,Great app!! Wish I had downloaded this months ago... We have this at my work and I love it! Why did I wait so long to get it for myself!?,pandora
Positive,"Pandora has been with me since its inception and on a 3G connection on an iPhone it worked GREAT.  When I took the plunge into the world of Android and 4G I had a problem with Pandora not wanting to work or was very sluggish between songs. It seems they have rectified that situation and all is good now. I can drive just about anywhere and have my music playing non-stop.  A couple of things for them to think about. I would like to see the ads more geared towards the particular user that is listening to music... one that listens to 'nature' or 'classical' is a different creature than one that listens to 'rap', 'rock', 'pop', etc. Regional ads would be great too. I would love to know that my local convenience store that is just down the street is having a sale on some widget.  All in all it was a rocky start and I went back to listening to other services for a while until Pandora got their act together and got an update out that fixed their problems. Since then... smooth sailing.  Pandora ROCKS!",pandora
Positive,"Here is a service that will play any song that is in their archive that you want to hear. They will even find similar songs to match to your interest. I started with Johnny Cash, and before I knew it through their recommendations I had many songs by many artists that they play randomly for me. I love it. And, they are adding more regularly. You can't beat this service and best of all it's free.",pandora
Positive,"I love the way it suggests other artists you might like and have found several that I hadn't really listened to before and really liked their music. And best of all it's free, you just have to listen to a few commercials but there aren't that many. For some reason when I listen at work it ""times me out"" but when I'm listening at home I don't get that.",pandora
Positive,"I love using pandpora and this app does the same thing. After some recent updates, they now have pop up ads that are a little intrusive but for me I use this the most when I am driving so I am not looking at the screen.  lag time in between songs is usually pretty good (not as quick as the desktop version with high speed internet connection) but overall not bad considering that I'm driving through numerous cell towers as I'm usually listening to Pandora. lag time can also be due to my Droid Pro, I have been having issues with it lately.  Nice album art when its playing (too bad it usually gets covered up with the ads) and very easy to use command buttons.",pandora
Positive,Love it I listened to it all day today.,pandora
Positive,"Love Pandora forever.It even plays Kpop for me.Pandora would be my soulmate if it wasn't a music app,it got better from the last few years.I just wish ads were gone,and I didn't need to pay to skip G-Dragon's crappy music (don't kill me fellow Kpopers)",pandora
Positive,"If I could give pandora ten stars I would.It is one of my favorite apps, if you like music this app is a must.It's worth paying the $4 to listen free of commercials.I have pandora on my phone, kindle and all my tv's at home.So I recommed to anyone who loves to hear a variety of music, sometimes you'll hear a tune that takes you back into time. So get it, you won't regret you did.",pandora
Positive,"being of the ""older generation"" but absolute music lover, my daughter told me about pandora and i haven't looked back !! didn't take me long to purchase the ad-free version ($4.99 a month). it's fantastic to be able to have so many genre's at your finger tips and take it wherever you go. i really love the blue-tooth feature in car while traveling and having my music as i like it !!!!! a truly great product ......",pandora
Positive,I love this app as I can listen no matter where i am. It keeps track of what i listen to and records all my thumbs up and downs and plays only music i will like to listen to (takes time but well worth it),pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora!! You can build your own stations, for example 70's music and then have the opportunity to like or dislike each song. This allows Pandora to find more songs that it thinks you will like and has given me back songs from my childhood, plus new favorites. Also, it allows you to listen to comediannes and then supplies you with others with the same type of humor, which allows you to ""discover"" new comics. THANK YOU!!",pandora

Positive,It's awesome! I love all the variety of all the stations! Thanks sooo much for such a great listening environment!,pandora
Positive,"Now if I can just figure out how to get it on my car radio, instead of Sirius.  They had special 4th of July channels of various types. I loved the Classical one.  For everyday listening, I like the different channels in my genre. The SHUFFLE feature is excellent, so you don't get bored listening to just one album.",pandora
Positive,"If it was possible I would give this no stars. I've had to shut down my kindle at least seven times in the last hour because I dared to use this poorly designed app. My kindle screen doesn't work when I've used this app. It comes up blank but the music continues to play. I used this app with my old kindle and experienced similar problems. I thought it was the kindle, but clearly there is an issue with the app. PLEASE FIX IT. I love Pandora radio but I won't be using it until the issue is solved.",pandora
Positive,"Once you get the hang of setting up the ""stations"" it's a piece of cake, and you'll never hear a song you don't like. I love a lot of different stuff; and I like having a place where I can hear Bach and Styx in the same place.",pandora

Positive,"I have always loved Pandora Radio and was excited to have it for my phone. But a lot of the times it will freeze or I've also encountered issues where it doesn't fully play the song and skips to the next. AND THE BUFFERING! Forget it! I will have a perfect connection and this will still occur. The ads also freeze up the program, too, I feel. Hopefully they will come out with an update that fixes this, unless it's just an error I'm receiving with my LG Optimus S.",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora!!! Its great and easy to use! Most music apps are confusing or take you straight to YouTube, but all the music is on Pandora.

Its my own personalized radio. it plays every song you can think of. so you make your own radio by typing in an artist/song and it creates it, then it also plays other similar artists. and you can add as many different artists on one radio you want, or you can make as many individual radios as you want also.",pandora
Positive,"Love, love, love pandora. I can never get enough of every kind of music I love. In the house on a walk and while I am mowing the lawn. It's always easy to get.",pandora
Positive,Love Pandora . We can listen to whatever we want whenever we want ! ??????,pandora
Positive,"How can you not love Pandora? It is so easy to use and it seems to play what you want to hear when you need to hear it. I have pandora on my computer, iPhone, TV and at work. Sometimes I want to hear a mix of my saved stations and other times, I just want to hear one. Pandora makes all this easy! Now, there are ads and I need to click on ""Still Listening"" every so often, but its free and I am ok with that.",pandora
Positive,"I used to love Pandora, until they decided to leave Mexico out of their service area. Now we get Spotify and Google Play and Grooveshark which, while not as good, at least they work over here.  Which brings me to my main question: Why are you offering this app to me if I can't use it?",pandora
Positive,its good I love it its free and I don't care if there are ads its something I'm used to..... I love the music and they just know me taste so well.....,pandora
Positive,"This app lets you enjoy the Pandora music stations that you've come to love on your desktop or laptop computer on your mobile device. Once it's downloaded and installed on your device you can sign in and enjoy all the stations that you've created on your computer or make some new ones from your mobile phone. Any stations you create or songs that you rate on the mobile will be integrated with your computer stations so you don't have to miss a step. Next time you log on to your computer it will be right there. Or vice versa. Your ratings will also be accessible on both of your devices or any devices where you install Pandora.  Yeah, there are a few ads, just like on the web. But they're short compared to commercial radio. And you can always upgrade ($36 per year at this time) and you won't hear any ads at all. The music will be higher quality (192K bits per second) and you can listen for 5 hours at a time without ever touching your device.",pandora
Positive,I love my Pandora except when it stops to ask me if I'm still listening!,pandora
Positive,"I was in the move to just listen to music without much talking, so I tuned into Pandora and this setup really worked for me. I love listening to this station that allows me to pick what I want to hear, along with this station adding music they think I want to hear, which the songs they picked are great choices. I would highly recommend other turn in too.",pandora
Positive,Love it but unless you purchase a subscription you will get commercials & there are restrictions on use,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora, but I like Tidal better.",pandora
Positive,I've always loved Pandora since day one! It's downloaded on all of my devices and I love to listen to when I sleep. I just don't like after every 2 or 3 songs there's 1 or 2 advertisements. I was paying for Pandora One so I wouldn't have ads but it just got ridiculous but I still love Pandora.,pandora
Positive,Love Pandora app especially on shuffle mode,pandora
Positive,"I love the Pandora app, it performs wonderfully on my kindle fire hd. I would love it even more if you could give songs a thumbs up/down when you swipe down from the top. I tend to listen to Pandora while browsing the web or playing games on my kindle so it makes it hard to go back and forth; it would be so much more efficient with that feature.",pandora
Positive,"This review is for those who are not yet familiar with Pandora. Once you create an account, it is like running your own radio station. You create your own channels by typing in an artist's name, such as ""Beatles"". You now have a channel that plays ramdom Beatles songs mixed in with songs from similar artists like The Rolling Stones and The Who. The basic application has no fees, and in my experience only throws in a 20-30 second commercial after every 15 to 20 songs. Pretty darn good for free! I don't know if there is a limit to the number of channels you can create, but I have at least 30 of them. One of the best benefits of Pandora is being 'turned onto' artists that you didn't know about, that are similar to some of your favorites. All your channels are saved online and connected to your account, so they can be accessed on all your devices (computer, tablet, net box, smart phone, etc.) without having to recreate them. If you're a music lover, this is the BEST free service on the internet.",pandora
Positive,"After creating numerous artist stations I love killing time with playing my Pandora. The fact it's absolutely free it Can't be beat. A must have, your party on the go where ever.",pandora
Positive,Love it could not do without it.,pandora
Positive,"Love that I can choose my artists and select different venues of music separately or mix them together as I choose Love that I can hear current songs or oldies Love that I can download it to my computer, my phone, my surface, literally anywhere. Dislike that I cannot always skip songs I don't like (only so many an hour), but I listen to this at work so this is a minor inconvenience overall great site I would recommend to anyone",pandora
Positive,"Pandora is a great media outlet when I want to listen to a variety of music while working online or studying for my classes. It gives me an outlet of all types of music from Classical to Modern Country, Old Rock and Pop that I have listened to all my life. Type in an artist's name and a radio station will pop up with this artist's songs with an addition of songs similar to the type of music presented. Love it Love it...",pandora
Positive,Love the app. Play it for my grandson's nap time.,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora and wish I had it on my car radio its so neat to chose your songs and the artist you love to hear. I spend alot of time changing channels on regular radio but thanks to Pandora I love listening on my phone, tablet and computer.",pandora
Positive,"With all the new music apps, Pandora is still my favorite. I love that I can pick my favorite artists for channels and Pandora never lets me down. I still use the free version being the ads aren't too frequent or too long. And Pandora always plays good music according to what you chose for your channels so you don't have to skip often.",pandora
Positive,"I used to love Pandora and could listen on my Kindle Fire (5th generation). Suddenly, I cannot open the app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled a couple of times and disabled battery saving functions but only get the message: ""Waiting for connection. Try again?"" I can listen on my phone but not the Kindle. So frustrated!!!",pandora
Positive,Love the music and stations,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora. I listen to it all the time. I love being able to add a thumbs up for a song if I like it, but I can remove it later if I get tired of hearing it. I also enjoy that there are several reggae, dancehall, and soca stations that play recent music.",pandora
Positive,Love this streaming app! The algorithm lets you hear new music to expand and exlore different tastes and genres. Excellent interface and smooth transition between different platforms. Great app for music!,pandora
Positive,Pandora is a great app for those of us that do not have all the gadgets to download music to. I just loaded it on my phone and absolutely love it. I will be putting it on my tablet next. I just put an artist or a or a genre of music and Pandora will play that type of music for me. This app is a must have plus it is free :),pandora
Positive,"I have been using Pandora for free for 3 years and I love it. My only complaint is that lately the advertisements are becoming more frequent and if you have a station set for a long time, songs start to repeat alot. To fix that just delete the station and make a new one.",pandora
Positive,"I love this app! Now I can listen to music anywhere I go! You can comment on songs, look up the lyrics(without going on the internet), and best of all create your on stations. The only thing that keeps me from rating it 5 stars is that it has too many adds. I realise you can upgrade to Pandora one but it is expensive. I would recommend this app but if you despise adds this is not the right app for you.",pandora
Positive,music lovers will love this. personalized radio. works really nicely on the kindle too. can access stations you make on other devices too...like your web browser or phone,pandora
Positive,I love being able to pick my own music. Pandora is the best ??????,pandora
Positive,I love this app. How I can replay songs and let the app know what songs I do and do not like. So easy to look up stations.,pandora
Positive,"At the touch of one's fingers, you have your own personal music station for your favorite genre of music. You can save the songs you've listened to, and even purchase them right off of Amazon's music hub. So awesome. This is a must for music lovers.",pandora
Positive,"You have to love Pandora. I know they push the commercial free product, but it's free music with playlists you can customize. Nothing to complain about here. They also seem to be doing a better job at narrowing down you're likes.",pandora
Positive,LOVE MUSIC AND COMEDY WHERE ELSE CAN YA GO TO HEAR IT ALL WONDERFUL IT'S AMAZING AND MY PEEPS LIKE IT TOO!!!,pandora

Positive,I love having this app on my kindle. It gives me the opportunity to listen to gospel music and worship God while I've got my hands busy. And I tend to listen to classical music with my headphones on as I read the Bible and other books! I use my Kindle as a tool to better myself so I like the fact that Pandora is an online radio station that I can customize my own channel with out loading my computer with lots of memory!,pandora

I know u can't exactly choose the song u want to listen to but it helps for me to discover other music that I might like. U can also skip a songs if u don't like the one playing.",pandora

I have never had such an experience listening to a station that sends you all different kinds of music that lifts your spirit all day long and the choices you can make to create your own station !! I never listen to the radio anymore or CDs best invention ever !",pandora
Positive,"Have liked Pandora from the moment I downloaded it. Fell IN LOVE WITH IT, once I discovered the pay version with no commercials. While there are other ""free"" radio apps...none offer the selection of genres, artist that Pandora does. One example..go to Iheart radio and put in Boy George.. has nothing ..BUT WI T H PANDORA I GOT CULTURE CLUB RADIO..THE SMALL YEARLY FEE IS WORTH HAVING NO COMMERICIALS AND THE BEST POSSIBLE SELECTION.",pandora

Positive,I LOVE PANDORA.....,pandora

Positive,love this service,pandora
Positive,Love this..best relaxation music,pandora
Positive,Found all the music I love. Pandora also added artists I didn't think of for me to choose. The app is very user friendly!,pandora
Positive,"I loved the Pandora app. When I first got it, it was completely free with ads. The ads were not frequent so that was fine. I established many stations and enjoyed it immensely. Then one day I opened the app. It said UPDATE AVAILABLE"" so I touched the update choice. What a mistake. It told me that Pandora now allowed a limited amount of listening hours. The amount was 20 hours. I was very upset. I am totally disabled. I depended on Pandora each day .It is very hard to lay down and do nothing all day. With Pandora I could change the genre throughout the day as my mood changed. If you've ever had to endure a day of silence ,with no one to converse with you may have a glimpse of an idea of how unnerving it can be. Music has always been a big part of my life now more than ever. I find solace in music. It occupies my mind and distracts me from the reality of how my life has changed. Everyone has heard of the power of music. It is true. It can lift you up,it can calm you down, it can entertain you, help the hours pass quicker or you can choose a genre that will help you meditate when you just need to disconnect. 20 hours is nothing for me. I am usually awake that long each day. Once the update installed it said I had reached my maximum for that month. I had to wait 3 1/2 weeks to listen again. I wrote to see if they could help. I don't have any disposable income to upgrade so I was offered 10 more hours...well that's an extra 1/2 day. So I waited. When I was able to listen again ""for free"" I noticed there were more frequent ads now to take up more time. I had asked what about all the hours not used by listeners each month. I bet not everyone uses their free allotment. Perhaps they could draw from that to help provide More time to those who need it. No response. The UPDATE NOW message was a deceitful ploy to force you to pay for something that ,when you joined ,was free. I often wondered if I hadn't updated maybe I would still be listening for free. So, now I listen to other music apps. I can choose my music,make play lists, etc. and they are completely free. I have also since learned that certain types of apps. including this one do not need to run at start up. This allows them to monitor everything you do. If you have personal information,saved passwords, whatever ,they can gain access and even worse share your info. Do the other stations have the clarity of Pandora, no, but I will continue using them because they are truly free, no veiled traps. I originally would have given Pandora a 5 star rating but I remove 1 star for being deceitful, 1 star for putting a limit on an app that was free and unlimited with never a mention of in app purchasing until the guise of an update was posted. I remove 1 star for increasing the frequency of ads once the limit was attached,reducing actual music time. I remove 1 star for their lack of interest in working out a solution that would allow someone who had grown to depend on their product to literally get them through each day. A way of life they could never understand and I don't wish it on anyone. I have never asked for a hand out but when I asked about all the people who don't use their max and what happens to that time, instead of saying they hadn't considered that or they would check or would even explore a solution they quickly said they would add a few hours and that was that. We were done. Discussion closed. For being so quickly dropped after being a listener for about a year I remove 1 star for disrespecting a customer who was evidently in need of their help. So Pandora you end up worth 1 star for the time I was a listener who thought it was wonderful of you to provide this service for free,although I hadn't known you were secretly monitoring my network usage and gathering information. It's a shame we couldn't work this out but there are always other fish in the sea.",pandora
Positive,"Lovely - all my favorite old school concert pianists, some lovely vintage recordings turn up as a nice surprise, and of course, Scarlatti wrote enough pieces to keep anyone happy for a very long time. Interrupted by loud commercials now and then, but it is free, so cannot complain, and if I wanted, I could purchase it and avoid the ads.",pandora

Positive,"I have loved Pandora for years, but I have always used it on my office computer. I never thought to download to my Kindle until I got an email offer. Loving it!!!",pandora
Positive,"I thoroughly enjoyed Pandora for about a month. Then all of a sudden I couldn't access. It just seems like it is constantly in scan mode during the daytime hours. It returns a message that my station will be back in a minute. At night I can access. But that doesn't help me at work during the day. If I could access it more regularly, I would give it 5 stars cause I love the concept.",pandora
Positive,I love the selection of songs on the Chris Stapleton radio. The shuffle play is great because I get to hear music I am familiar with but also am exposed to new artists that I wouldn't otherwise hear. I love listening to Pandora.,pandora
Positive,We love Pandora... most excellent!,pandora
Positive,Music that I love,pandora
Positive,I absolutely love Pandora!! I listen to it all the time and I can change the music to what ever I'm in the mood for,pandora

Positive,I love being able to listen to only the music I like.,pandora
Positive,I love that this app plays in the background so I can listen to music and be on the internet.,pandora
Positive,Who doesn't love free music? I know I do. The commercials don't even bother me. My problem is that sometimes I want to listen to a certian artist not artists that are similar to them.,pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora. I appreciate that there are no commercials or over-the-top DJs spouting off about things nobody wants to hear. Pandora is just music. I have a station for every possible mood: from Slipknot, to Sting, to Yoga Radio. It's as versatile as I am. The ability to create stations by band, song, or genre. I like having the option of ""thumbs down"" when I don't want a particular song to be part of my listening experience. The variety is fantastic.",pandora
Positive,To many comercials. I do like the fact that I put in the Beattles and got a station with 70's music.What's not to like about that. The best music erra in the last 50 yrs. But the advertisements put me off. I do understand that if it weren't for them -I wouldn't be getting a farout station. My 12 yr. old grandson loves pandora.,pandora
Positive,"i am really really thinking about signing up for the permanent, no commercial one, because I simply love this. I was switching back and for from this to Songza, because was stopping my service after 30 days of listening, and cutting me short, I guess because I listened to it too much, without signing up, but I think that has been discontinued, now Pandora is my #1 .....thanks Pandora, and I will be signing up for commercial-free listening soon",pandora
Positive,"I love having good music in the background while reading, studying or just working on any project and this app fills that need admirably.",pandora

Positive,Love listening / to music,pandora
Positive,"I LOVE Pandora, and this app works great! All the features you love on your tablet! Works like a charm. If you can think of the artist or music, chances are they have it!",pandora
Positive,Love having choices!,pandora
Positive,"I found Pandora only recently and at first loved it. I even paid the fee to get the enhanced service without commercials and longer stretches of music. Maybe its because I started listening to it more often at work that I started noticing this: Pandora regularly cuts off songs before they're over. At first I thought they were just chopping off a few seconds at the end, but today they cut off a four minute song after playing it for only 30 seconds. I've really noticed this when trying to use their shuffle feature - it seems a lot worse there.  When I first found Pandora I thought it was awesome. But the whole point of it is listening to songs you like, and a service that cuts off songs you like while you're right in the middle of listening to them - it's becoming highly irritating. In the end, great idea, but I can't recommend them. Certainly not for money, and if people just want to listen for free, well, you get what you pay for.",pandora
Positive,I love this app. The music sounds great. It is very easy to use. I would highly recommend this app.,pandora
Positive,I love this it is so good even thought you have to listen to ads it is great their is every artist I want even if I don't like them,pandora
Positive,I love Pandora. I have a sedentary job that allows me to listen. Pandora helps me get through the day with the music that I enjoy!!!,pandora
Positive,"I LOVE PANDORA. I listen pretty much every day. It's awesome, definitely give it a listen!!",pandora
Positive,Love this game!! Very relaxing.,pandora
Positive,very enjoyable I like being able to select the music that I love and so many artists to select from thank you Pandora.,pandora
Positive,"My experience with Pandora has actually been quite nice. My first use was on their mobile app. It took me a little bit of time to learn how to signup and setup my account, and it was a bit annoying, however after that the experience was great. The technology behind Pandora really predicted some really great music for me. I really loved how I could discover new tracks. In fact, even though other services have other features, thus far, Pandora has helped me discover the most music. The app feels solid, nothing brilliant, but it does what I want it to do, play music. It has a modern look, with slight bugs but it doesn`t really matter. Great service, and must try app!",pandora
Positive,Awesome way to listen to your favorite artists! I dont know how I lived without Pandora!. Its the first thing I turn on before I head into the kitchen to cook. I love that it stays in the genre I prefer.,pandora
Positive,"I'm increasingly disliking Pandora more and more everyday. Just this morning Pandora crashed on my phone five times before playing a full song, and the night before was a constant crashing battle on my tablet. Then the ads for the nonpaid version are overwhelming, and all too often uninteresting material, but the full version is now FAR too expensive for what little control the user actually has for me to even consider paying. I used to love Pandora.",pandora
Positive,My grandchildren have been telling me about Pandora for quite a while but it's just since I received my new Kindle that I have actually tried it. I love being able to select the music which I enjoy the most while not listening to music I don't like as well. The pop ups are annoying and I understand I'm able to pay eight dollars a month and not have them but that is too expensive for me on a limited budget. How about discounts for seniors???,pandora
Positive,"One of the things I love most about Pandora is how one artist leads to another, introducing me to music and musicians. The fact that I can access it anywhere has helped me make it through road trips in the car and spinning at the gym. I only wish their play list for some of my favorite artists was longer/deeper. That is a serious limitation that I hope their growth will enable them to gradually overcome.",pandora
Positive,I have found new music that I have fallen in love with because of Pandora. I don't hear the same songs over and over again.,pandora
Positive,I love hving my choice of music wherever I go!,pandora
Positive,I love this app u can get all your favorite music in one place but you can't request songs can like them and they will show up on your thumbprint radio.,pandora
Positive,"Love this app. Would love it more if there was a search capability to find older music or artist. Being a member of old school, there are older tunes that would flow nicely in todays musical mix! I know there are people out there that could mix older tunes with today's music to create a beatuiful and relaxing experience",pandora
Positive,Okay. first this is a great app to have. I loved it when I was living in the USA. But now I am living in France and the app does not work here. I miss mu music that I used to listen to. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix it to were I can listen to Pandora's music again.,pandora
Positive,I thoroughly enjoy the music and there is a great variety. Very easy to listen to. Love it and would refer it to others.,pandora
Positive,"Pandora is one of the best things that I ever had on my computer. To be able to listen to the type of music that I enjoy is remarkable. The music selections that are played are everything that I truly enjoy. Very rarely do I ever have a thumbs down on my ratings. I would highly reccommend this to any music lover. It is just like magic. Puff and the music that you love is there.",pandora
Positive,"I love this app. I'm still a little be too new to my way around Pandora, but what I know about it I enjoy. Perfect for when I am reading a news article, enjoying a new book or just browsing the web. It is going to take a few more days for me to learn my way around it, but it isn't difficult. It is rich with ""customizing""",pandora
Positive,"i love this app! but only the paid version. the ads in the free version are annoying beyond words. i like how you can customize your playlists, discover new artists in genre you like. i haven't listened to the radio in years because i'm sick of commercials and how they beat all songs dead by repeating them every 3 songs. so discovering new artists and music is now done with Pandora. i do wish they would allow you to skip an unlimited amount of tracks, esp when your a paid member. it doesn't seem fair to force you to listen to songs you dislike or are not in the mood for.  i highly recommend Pandora!",pandora
Positive,"I love Pandora!! It allows me the chance to pick the music style I want to listen to and make a channel that plays similar music. I find new artists that I had never heard of before everyday. If I don't like a song they are playing all I have to do is give it a thumbs down and it disappears from the playlist. I have channels I pick to clean house by, dance to, and just hang out to. Love Pandora!",pandora
Positive,"I like Pandora Radio, even if it has commercials. I'm able to have several stations. some times it keeps playing music i don't love, but don't hate, but it irritates me after 3/4 song. Now, the advertising has gotten overwhelming the only thing is that Pandora radio is mostly music and half of the advertising is not heard. I do enjoy the new sleep timer, very convenient.",pandora
Positive,"I think this app is amazing. I love music and this app let me listen to all the music I love. I strongly suggest that if u love music, down load this app I promise u'll love it. The only thing I wish good change would be for the user to be able to replay the whole song instead of just a sample or wait till it comes on again, but otherwise I love and I hope u love it too! Lol",pandora

Positive,Pandora gets me through my work day. I love the variety of music. Christian rock is my favorite I like the fact that its free.,pandora
Positive,"I like this app, especially the ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" rating scale. What I would LOVE to have as an option on this app is to stream the radio versions vs. the explicit versions of the songs. Overall, I'm very pleased with the app.",pandora
Positive,"LOVE IT! It really assists me in finding other artists that are in the same genres that I like listening to. However, when I just want to listen to that ONE artist - I can not.  It is awesome 99% of the time. xoxo",pandora

Positive,"I love Pandora. I've had it for ages, it's literally the best internet radio station!",pandora
Positive,"I have a blackberry classic and when I got this it took forever to install and then when I tried to sign up the top bar covered the username blank space. Please fix this, I love Pandora.",pandora
Positive,"I have been a Pandora fan since its very beginning, and had it on each of my BlackBerrys before switching to Android and the Droid Charge. It almost always picks mosaic I love from my seed songs and artists and I can't begin to tally the number of artists I discovered on Pandora.I've tried the copycat services, but they don't even begin to compare to Pandora. I believe the difference is that Pandora has humans do the categorizing rather than a computer. If you are serious about music --- it is the center of my life --- you must get Pandora AND sign up for the paid Pandora One subscription. Out is definitely worth the $35 of you listen even a fraction as much as ii do.Out is the only service I pay for other than Sirius, but that isn't really about tykes music.",pandora
Positive,I listen to music based on my mood. I love the flexibility of how Pandora chooses my music. They play songs that I have long forgot about. I love the troops down memory lane. Thanks!,pandora
Positive,"I personally love pandora, the interface is really user-friendly and they offer a huge variety of music genres I really would like to add the mood option that other music services offer like google music but besides that im really happy with Pandora",pandora

Positive,Love Pandora have a station for every mood,pandora

Positive,Great music of your choosing! I would recommend this product to any music lover who likes variety. I absolutely love Pandora.,pandora
Positive,"Works exactly like the PC version. In fact, this app does pick up your PC playlists. Very clear sound. If you have not used Pandora before, you will love the music, because you set the playlist name. As an example, some of my lists are named ""Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Connie Francis"". When you set this playlist, not all of the songs are by the artist listed. On the Frank Sinatra list, I get Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, and many more. On many days, I will switch between lists, depending on my mood. This app is well worth downloading.",pandora

Positive,I've been using Pandora for quite sometime. I love being able to customize my stations with the music and bands I want to hear. If I could change one little thing it is to automatically remove Holiday music from my station after the holiday is over. Otherwise it continues to play and I have to thumb it down and add it back manually later. I think it is really easy to use. Some songs will even have lyrics available which is nice if I feel the need to sing along and don't know it well.,pandora

Positive,"Everybody loves Pandora. I was at a barbecue block party and somebody said, ""Where's the Music?"" So I got out my Galaxy 4, started Pandora, and found a Jazz program. I turned the volume up to full and put my phone on a table next to the grill. It stayed there all afternoon with people walking by saying, ""the music's nice, where's the stereo?"". It was so easy, and it was a big hit.",pandora

Positive,Love it!,iradio
Positive,"I LOVE this app????.Highly recommended for all who enjoy listening to music! And when you get it click the search for ""IHeart Christmas"" and save it to your favorites!!!",iradio
Positive,"I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc. I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice.",iradio
Positive,awesome! exactly the app i have been looking for to listen to public radio and music from across the nation.,iradio
Negative,"This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app.",iradio
Negative,Iheart works great I just wish you could speak to Alexa and tell her to play a station from it instead of having to go through the phone to make it work,iradio
Negative,Love the commercial free app. Sometimes there is a 30 second ad at the beginning then that's it for hours. I don't like that you can only skip so many times a day because sometimes there is some really horrid stuff.,iradio
Negative,"It does not state that a facebook account is NEEDED to use this. Oh, you seen the Facebook icon when you start up? Hit the maybe later button! Before you freak out and throw a hundred 1-* reviews at it, for some of you, stop putting reviews on what you read on the review page. It only states that do you want to use facebook, to like songs and stations, and create so called stations of your own. Facebook isnt needed here, and it shouldnt be needed anywhere, as well as wanted anywhere.",iradio
Negative,Decent service. Love the fact that it's bundled w/ Prime. Makes Primes an even greater bargain! The service itself is.... useable... The music selection is not as vast as other services and the audio quality for some reason is only so-so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline those are must have for any music streaming services. Hopefully artists and content will increase with time. Impossible to give a bad review to free service to Prime subscribers but I wouldn't mind paying an extra few bucks a month if the issues noted above were addressed.,Amazon
Negative,I am a prime member and looking forward to listening to Prime music in addition to the music I bought. This app crashed and did some bad things to my Samsung Galaxy S4 tablet. This app does not work.i do not recommend this app.,Amazon
Negative,"The Good: prime members get a lot of free music, buying song is easy, the quality is also very good, like the addition of the lyrics.  The Bad: sometimes it crashes, I can't edit playlist without interrupting the music, and I saw that the app drains a lot of battery comparing with other music players. And is a little confusing at first when trying to organize your music.  I still gave a 4 star cause of the free music for prime members. Is it wasn't for that I'll give it a 3.",Amazon
Negative,I'm an international subscriber. I couldn't make use of my prime music nor videos. I couldn't even buy anything. My credit card is accepted for goods purchases but not for music or videos. Apple is doing a better job! Too bad.,Amazon
Negative,"This app hasn't blown me away or anything, but it does what it is supposed to. I ended up deleting it off my phone, but that wasn't because it was a bad app. My phone just doesn't have a lot of storage so if I find an app that I do not use often, I quickly delete them.",Amazon
Negative,"I was one of the early Prime subscribers, and generally am more than pleased by Amazon, their products and services, and usually have nothing bad to say about Amazon.... However, that having been said, while I do enjoy Amazon Prime Music (APM) I am forced to uninstall it. It is a HUGE, space-consuming app! Let me elaborate: I've had this smart phone for just barely over a year. I don't download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l. APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly, in one of the folders within APM, I found numerous folders with names such as [500] and [47] and [200], etc. Within EACH of these numerous folders, I found the EXACT same images of album covers, (many/most of which I never played, viewed, downloaded, etc. - most were from the &#34;Recommended for you&#34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon, and the other suggestions, etc.,made by Amazon) Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images & data, there's apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary (space-destroying!) data! Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images & data, the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96[GIGABYTES!] -let me make this perfectly clear here, that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes, NOT Megabytes!! WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS & PLAYS MUSIC &#60;need&#62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!? This is absolutely RIDICULOUS, I *HOPE* someone at Amazon is reading this and looking into this... With APM installed, I was constantly receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work. That was correct, I missed phone calls, could not receive texts, etc., and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed. This includes my Android system OS, obviously, and virus/malware protection updates, ... and, just to be clear, this overwhelming space-consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files, and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!! Completely unacceptable, thus it gone, uninstalled. When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones (which are NOT huge space-storage devices, to begin with!), I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!",Amazon
Negative,"I am used to listen music in itunes radio or from my itunes library. But in Android I had very limited possibilities to listen music, I ignore if I had bad luck with apps for Andrid or they lack of good music apps for Android, but this, the Amazon app is a very good app for downloading your own purchased and free music! I now can listen good music in my Android cellphone too. (I own Prime membership, so I wonder everyone can have free music without it).",Amazon
Negative,"The cool thing about the MP3 app is the Cloud service and the store has some of the music I listen to, is relatively cheaper than iTunes. Cloud service is cool. I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)  Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix.",Amazon
Negative,bloated unfriendly interface nearly as bad as iTunes since deleted will never reinstall or buy music from amazon again,Amazon
Negative,"Great product. We have had this for months now on our laptop and phones. It has kind of replaced iTunes and Pandora for us. Although my wife still listens to Pandora every once in a while. The promo credit for shipping on a longer time schedule gave us the opportunity to buy lots of songs for free, now we are hooked. Too bad that promo ended.",Amazon
Negative,At this point and time I have to give it a bad review. The app worked great until an update would only play songs I had purchased from other apps none of the amazon prime songs would play! So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and now it comes up with a message that states my device cannot be authenticated! App won't even open now!,Amazon
Negative,I rated it why do I need to write a review? If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.,Amazon
Negative,"Sucks! A bad imitation of Pandora that promises music purchase and download ability yet makes it nearly impossible with a maze of hoops to jump through. The previous Amazon Music format was way better, wish all my music purchases hadn't been swallowed by some ringtone app...",Amazon
Negative,"If I could rate this less than one star, I would. I already pay for Prime. I'm not paying for more. This is almost as bad as the video. I'll just get my music somewhere else.",Amazon
Negative,"The app restarts constantly,uses up unnecessary memory,slows/lags the phone making it freeze and choppy.Downloading songs to the phone is a pain...constantly have to uninstall app and reinstall to download music Ive bought. Its just a very bad app. Uninstalled it today and my phone works fine again...also uninstalled the Amazon Underground app-which is another horrible app as far as memory usage,restarting and lagging the phone. Im done with Amazon apps. Ill stick with Google music for my source of music.",Amazon
Negative,Does not work on PC. After 10 hours of downloading nothing played or download. Where is the support? iTunes is a horrible this maybe the only software that maybe as bad.,Amazon
Negative,Downloaded in error...my bad.,Amazon
Negative,"Not bad, but has no equalizer. This alone is very disappointing. Amazon offers a free equalizer app for Android, there is no reason for not having one as part of this product that I'm paying for with my prime account.",Amazon
Negative,"I really wasn't sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it's just OK since the app is not all that bad (lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet) and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I'd have to stay with 3 stars.  Issue #1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I couldn't move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can't play any prime music, but that's OK because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.  Issue #2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that didn't make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I'm sure there are many more. Disappointing.",Amazon
Negative,Not too bad but lacks a large variety in the classic country genre. When listening to their radio during a work day it seems like I listen to the same songs 2 and 3 times in an 8 hour period. I switched back to Pandora for my music streaming needs.,Amazon
Negative,It's a fairly good music app but you can't download any of the Prime music unless you buy it. The free offerings are not bad but not that great so what's the point? Pandora or an Ipod are probably a little better.,Amazon
Negative,Not bad at all. I like it. The only bad thing is it only lets you stream from one device at a time. I cannot stream music on my phone while wife is on hers. It asks me to kick her off. Very bad design.,Amazon
Negative,"So so, I preffer google play for listening to my songs not in the cloud and almost all of my music is not in the cloud and I don't want it there. So Amazon is great and cloud music and bad at mp3s.",Amazon
Negative,"Just started using music, so far not bad. Its not the latest selling singles but hey, way cheaper.",Amazon
Negative,"Really like the playlists and stations. Would be good if more recent stuff was included but when you look what you are paying for Amazon Prime and all the other benefits, not bad value for money.",Amazon
Negative,"Not quite as good as Google Play Music as far as subscription services go, but it is not a bad addition to Amazon Prime. Who can complain about free music, let's be honest, I purchased prime for the shipping aspect, not the instant video or the music.",Amazon
Negative,Since the most recent update this app has become unusable and useless. As soon as you open the app it freezes and causes a forced close. It is so bad that it makes Google's MP3 music player look like geniuses created it. Please fix this payer or make the previous version available until you fix this horrible app.,Amazon
Negative,"Think its cool never had music on my phone or computer ,but my kids did . Amazon made it easy can't wait to show kids i'm cool too ,or groovy or bad whatever the saying is these days .",Amazon
Negative,It's not a bad music app the only thing I don't like about it is that you cannot adjust the equalizer settings,Amazon
Negative,"The Mac version of Amazon Music Player is garbage, pure and simple. I can't speak for the Windows version, but the Mac version frequently (read: almost always) hangs for LONG periods of time before showing tracks in any section of the player. It also appears to use a lot of resources - I see system-wide issues while using Music Player, but when I completely close out of it, OS X goes back to behaving like it should. Now that we're forced to use this player to download any music we've added to Amazon Music, I've gone from merely irritated to absolutely angry. It is AWFUL software, and after several years dealing with quirks and outright problems with Amazon Music, I really wonder if Amazon will EVER get this working correctly.  Other ""fun"" issues:  Badly matched songs (completely the wrong recordings - we're talking live songs being replaced by studio versions!) You can attempt to correct the match, but I have yet to get this to work well.  MISSING songs! Inexplicably, some songs are just GONE from my library. Totally random - most albums are fine, others are missing this or that song, or maybe a couple. Infuriating.  Tag editor destroys existing ID3 tags: if you dare edit any info in the file(s) you've uploaded, you will be rewarded with a downloadable version that has completely stripped out ALL tags. You won't know what song is what. ALL tags are empty, so there will be no artist to go by, no track name, no track number, no album name. NOTHING. This sounds completely unacceptable were it not for the need to rarely do this, but what makes it truly completely unacceptable is the fact that tracks in your library may randomly have their ID3 tags altered by either the uploader, whatever software runs on Amazon's servers, or the Music Player. And you're screwed at that point.  Other than that, it's GREAT.",Amazon
Negative,Honestly not that bad. Now I can't find some of the song because I refuse to buy music for 1.29 but every store is like that but quite frankly I love it,Amazon

Negative,I really don't know if it's OK but I didn't want to give it a bad review. I am unable to use the app on my phone as it has an earlier Android version. Interestingly it seems to install the earlier version of the app not the 'with Prime Music' version. Not usable as intended on my phone.,Amazon
Negative,"This app is terrible. I love amazon. I love their music. I buy everything from them and have prime!!! I've bought music from Amazon since they sold only cds... But...this app just stinks. The sound isn't as good as other apps, it doesn't read my other playlists and it got corrupted somehow on my phone. After deleting it and reinstalling this app about 15 times, it finally worked as it used to.. Without my amazon prime music playlists. Badly done, Amazon.

Negative,"Some of the albums are not original, but rerecorded like the band Bad finger for example. Why?",Amazon
Negative,"This app would not work on my RAZR... However, it works as intended (which is not to say smoothly) on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. My opinion has greatly improved since upgrading, but there is still a ballroom left for improvement...  THE GOOD: *Prime Music - ""Free"" with Prime, I didn't have that feature when I subscribed, so it's a plus. I've found around 10 albums on Prime that I didn't already have, so I can listen for ""Free"" and see if I want to buy them permanently. *I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone. *Download for listening offline is great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without using data, perfect! Better than Pandora. This IS about the only Positive point of the actual App...  THE BAD: *Downloading/finding my purchased Amazon music is much harder than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music, but I don't see a way to do that. *Storage of offline listening music can't be moved, no option for it... *Doesn't resume play once app is shut down. This makes it a terrible music player. I don't really want the app running all the time, but that means I need to remember where I left off... This alone is worth 1 star. *I don't seem to be able to hide anything from it... I listen to one type of music, but I need to purchase other music here and there. I don't want that cluttering things up, but I am astounded at the lack of options in this app...  You can do better Amazon...",Amazon

Negative,This app will crash . I have it on a tab 3 8.0 and when I try to down load from recently added music . The app crashes so bad that it wont even finish sending it's own error report . Amazon prime can and should do better if they want my next renewal .,Amazon

Negative,"The last 2 updates have absolutely ruined Amazon music. I love Amazon but they are now trying to force users into purchasing Amazon Unlimited for 9.99 a month. Nope. I pay for Prime. This app is now horrible to navigate and nearly impossible to purchase music. At every selection, you are promoted to try Unlimited for 30 days free. Greedy Amazon. Bad form.",Amazon
Negative,"I like this app for the most part.I have used the PC version for Windows, the iPad app, and the Android app for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Over all it performs well enough, but i do have a few gripes about it.  First complaint is where is the version for the Fire TV? I'm using the app on an Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft device, but Amazon hasn't got a version yet for their own device?? I keep hearing soon, but soon is never soon enough!  My next complaint is with editing songs/albums you have uploaded to the cloud. As with the Amazon MP3 app that this app replaced there is no way to edit album art. I have over 15,000 songs uploaded to the Amazon Cloud Player and a number of them don't have the correct album cover art. Some have no album art at all even though all my songs/albums have a high quality image embedded in the MP3 file itself. If the mobile apps can't do this so be it, but you should at least be able to copy/paste your own album art on a PC or Mac similar to Google Play Music , iTunes, etc.  I also cant seem to stream any music via 3G/4G without constant buffering, so i have to make sure I remember to download music via Wi-Fi before leaving the house. I don't believe this is a limitation of the app, but has more to do with my cell carrier (Sprint) in my area. I also can't stream from Spotify either so it's more of a network issue.  I also don't like the fact that you have to add anything you want to play for the Prime Music selection to your library before you can play it. I use services like Spotify, Slacker, and Amazon Music to discover bands as well as play music I already know, so I don't want to add music to my library that I might not even like. We should be able to play the music and then add to our personal library if it turns out you like it.  Otherwise I think its a good app with much potential. The GUI is nice enough and easy to use. I expect Amazon, with their deep pockets, to sign more music labels and make more music available for Prime members in the future, but the selection isn't bad considering Prime Music just launched about 3 weeks ago. Still has a ways to go to reach Spotify's catalog of songs/artists/albums.",Amazon
Negative,"I love Amazon. I love Amazon music. I only want to buy my music from Amazon. I'd love to be able to play my Amazon music with my Amazon music app. But it sucks. I start it, it just shuts down. I start it again, get my band picked (on Prime, or my library) shuts down again.  Since I've had the app, I spent a lot of time setting my playlists. Then you update and bam, playlists are empty. I've done that multiple times. If you all don't do something I'm going to migrate to a different company. I don't want to, but as another reviewer said, you have to try hard to make an app this bad.",Amazon
Negative,"I just started using because it was in my Prime membership. So, why not - right?  It surprised me in a good way! The app has been updated, so it runs pretty smoothly in Android. It has a decent quality in streaming, but I recommend downloading and playing offline your favorite music. The audio quality will be top!  The desktop app is basically Spotify with an Amazon skin. So, you know what to expect.  Unfortunately, my cars don't have a link to this app, so I only have basic controls over Bluetooth - which is not bad at least, but not perfect. However, nothing that makes me stop using it.  If you're Prime, this is a must use!",Amazon

Negative,"So - last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. (Seriously? Google?) (I expect it from Microsoft - every MS Windows-based music player I have ever touched has been below lame.) I didn't care for Pandora - I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.  So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say ""Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it's MP3 then store it all here!!"" SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.  I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that won't ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes - and on an old iPod Photo 60G. (The 4g iPod still lives - but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom.) So over the next few weekends I open the laptop, start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. (A Samsung Charge on Verizon - a nice phone - good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill - ""City ID"" is one that is $2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!)  After a month I was all done.  Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs (250 - how laughable! NOT!) ... unless I pay $24.95 a year?  Even though the price is reasonable - I still feel like - for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year, 5Gigs is free - I used my allotment and no more. When they said ""It's free!"" I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.  Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization -- so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers - where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind - to the tune of $25 bucks a year just months later?  And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. (I only traveled 25K miles last month, go figure!!) Now I have to re-rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I've got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic-appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.  I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out - M-A-D-MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.  If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive - where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT - I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot ""download"" an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap - promise. I am just that mad.  Two other complaints: I use a netbook most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The ""Artist"" column can not be expanded for example. You can't sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: ""display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues"" -- but yea, now my playlists are gone unless I fork over $24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn-tooting be nicely functional ok?  Last - the Droid App took over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still -- to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a ""you must agree to this"" message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean, I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen took over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen took over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen took over. At that point in time I deleted this app, the Amazon Marketplace app, the Amazon Price Checker app, the Amazon Student app, The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.  Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.  Thank you for listening. I am sorry for this rant. I promise to be my normal, happy, down-to-earth self... next year sometime!!!  Yes. I am just that mad.",Amazon

Negative,"The layout is not user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion. This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles. Fine, but I feel like I've lost a useful app in the revision.  In the previous app version: it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising (listening whilst in motion). You now have to stop, go to additional screens (with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards!), & take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions (get playlist on device, shuffle, repeat song, etc.). Unacceptable from both a safety (car) &/or usability standpoint (exercise).  When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile (eg: hear a song in a store that you like)- it STILL loads it to the internal memory. (!!!) My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.  Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles. Great if you're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.  The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions. (This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is).  Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade. OH....SOoooo not happy about that. I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I (now know that I) should have backed them up. I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists (not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc.). Am not happy about this.  I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime. (I don't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi). When I'm on a road trip- it's my bandwidth that's used if so. I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I don't need to use bandwidth to listen. Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation. If I'm at home, fine.  But it simply doesn't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up. What do I gain here by using this app? Whatever I do gain- it's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort. Amazon's late to the game on this.  Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I won't be using their app (won't be running across products to buy).",Amazon

I WANT IT ALL OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT!!!  Amazon music is the worst program I have EVER run into, and I have been in computers since 1972. THE WORST I have ever run into!  It appears that they want us to leave everything on the cloud, make play lists and stream it off the cloud. The problem with that is that mostly I send it to my tablets and my phone, which I then listen to in my car or out in public. The tablets only ever have an internet connection in my house.

I need to download to my devices. ALL OF THEM! All my music.  Let me repeat, AMAZON MUSIC is the WORST program I have EVER RUN INTO.

Negative,"I like Amazons cloud and being able to upload (for free) your own music and download it on any device. While it wasnt my go to music app, because it was limited, it still did what it did very well.  With the addition of free music for prime members how ever it feels that the weakness of the app's design has appeared. Prime members get a mix of; bad, ok, excellent choices of free music to choose from. Im a progressive house/trance fan so my selection is super limited. Im not one for modern day pop music.  I know millions of people are okay hearing a song for the 30th time on the radio and for some reason add it to their playlist for more future listening. But I dont like that type of music. So I must depend on browsing for music. Prime music makes it really hard because the music I KNOW I want to hear isnt free so I wish Prime can introduce me to music I may want to hear that is available to prime members. Currently the only way to introduce listeners to new music is by listening to other peoples play list. Which so far I have found nothing I fully enjoy. And it seems you cant manipulate the playlist that easily. The user interface makes it difficult to add/delete music. Is the music I downloaded on my phone via a playlist totally tied to just that playlist or is it in my music library?  *In addition I found that even searching for music even with knowing an artist makes finding prime music a pain. While typing in an artist on my PC (which by the way you can only sample songs when using amazon.com but you can search, meanwhile amazons music program lets you play a full song added to your library but you can search for songs outside of your library) I found that not all the songs for prime were listed when typing in the artists name. I had to type in the song individually to get that result.  All in all it is a smooth start for Prime. Very little bugs.  Pros: Not laggy and no bugs yet Free Music Great launch for Prime Pop music for the masses.  Cons: Hodge podge of song selections makes finding music you want to listen to more annoying. Music discovery is dependent on other peoples playlist. No I dont want to listen to Nicky Romero, Pitbull, and Armin all at once.

Negative,"Amazon needs to make some major improvements to their Amazon Music App on the Kindle Fire series. It does not work well offline (appears the buffer memory is way too small). Besides not working well offline, you have to actually tell the Kindle Fire device to work offline and then tell it again to work online... How stupid is that? Can't Amazon's own app on it's own name brand device figure out if it is connected to WiFi or not and function accordingly? I love the Amazon Music service concept, but the Amazon Music App currently is so sub-par. In addition, when the Amazon Music App crashes, you literally have to reboot by turning off the Fire and then turning it back on again. On both my Apple and other Android-based devices, in the rare instance that an app does crash, you can wait a few seconds and then just re-launch it. Not so with Amazon Music. To shame!  Also, it appears that the Amazon Music App has functionality issues with reading/writing music files on large memory cards. I have had Amazon Music crash and then my Fire HD 8 suddenly can't read my name-brand 64GB SDHC card after the Amazon Music App crashed. I've had this behavior happen many times... Then it takes a series of reboots to get it to properly read the memory card (and apps loaded on it which are all grayed out on the screen) again. And then the Fire HD 8 and all apps and media on the memory card will work just fine for days, usually as long as Amazon Music App doesn't crash out again!!! So that tells me it's not a bad memory card at all... Somethings wrong with Amazon's app / device.  Overall, the Fire HD 8 Tablet seems to be an excellent low-priced tablet, but the Amazon Music App and phantom memory card error issues are killing it for me. Amazon, you're better than this, right? Get your device and app teams to fix this or I'm moving to Spotify and likely never coming back!",Amazon
Negative,"Mediocre at best. The prime music stations are utterly lacking in descriptive information. You are forced to try one-- and if it's absolutely horrible to you?

You realize that station is not for you.  But. The app *now* thinks you LIKE that sort of crap-- and offers more of the same dreck! Horrible!  A simple description under each station is too much to ask? Or even just a category label? No? As if I'm supposed to recognize these people (after which the station is named... right)?  I'd love to learn about new artists-- but not at the risk of opening a station that absolutely sets my teeth on edge (i.e. ""cow hard country""... makes me ill).  Where is a FILTER for the prime stations?

Negative,"You buy music with this app, but you can't play it on any of your new devices. It's the worst.

So Amazon Music will give an error called ""Ah fiddlesticks"" which means... awe, our music software can't play the music you paid for on your new smartphone.  Oh and then, it says that you have to buy a Kindle or something like that in order to register your new device.

Negative,"This app only does a few things, it's basically a music player with a built-in store. Being someone who uses Amazon Cloud Player, I expected this to work like a breeze but there are all kinds of problems.  The main one is that across both this app and the Cloud Player, Amazon have a pathological problem with track ordering and identifying albums which has STILL not been fixed. Talk about keeping the main thing, the main thing, I can't imagine how they can't fix it. Uploading tracks from iTunes to Cloud Player lose their track ordering because some of them get the year and disc number and some don't. Album artwork that is taken from a completely different album even though the tracks I've uploaded all have the correct tagging. I thought this was perhaps a Cloud Player issue but...  ...nope. This app seems to have the same problems. Take Presto, an album by Rush which I uploaded from iTunes. It broke like most albums did so I had to reset the tags in Cloud Player to make the track listings work and now they are correct. I recently bought a new phone and got this app, downloaded Presto from Cloud Player and....the app thinks it is two different albums so now if I want to play the whole album, I can't without creating a playlist. One of them is listed as Presto with the srtwork from Presto and has 3 songs on it and the other is also listed as Presto but with the artwork from Chronicles with the other 8 songs on it.  How on earth have Amazon mucked this up so badly? They are supposed to be kings of online sales and probably sell a large percentage of the online music market but this is basic cock up 101. The fact it has not been fixed? Fail The fact that this occurs on two products? Fail The fact that it happens on the app even when the tracks are supposedly downloaded from Cloud Player which is setup correctly? Fail The fact you can't even force the music on the app to go to the correct place? Fail The fact that the app thinks that Presto by Rush and Presto by Rush are two different albums? Fail.  Also, the tracks sometimes reset back to the beginning when playing.  The only reason I don't move to another service is that iTunes and Google Music don't sound much better.

I'm blocked from even purchasing it (at $0 of course). Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for!  Maybe I shouldn't complain as the old app works fine for me. On the other hand a lot of good music seems to be disappearing from Prime music and I expect the added cost music subscription may be needed in the future to get good tunes. Just feeling a little dark at a good thing like prime being eaten away in parts I care about.  I hope Amazon isn't blocking all older devices from new apps. That would be bad. I'm giving this app only 1 star till this gets resolved, if ever.",Amazon
Negative,"I want to rip the software from my computer and kill it - this is horrible, it freezes, it shuts off, it takes about 25 minutes to 45 minutes ON HIGH SPEED internet connection to download cd, that is if it doesnÕt crash in the middle of the process. I DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! This is horrible. I am going to look for a different place to purchase music, I can no longer deal with trying to use this nasty, horrible, uncooperative, freezing, non-working software. Amazon you are forcing customers to use this instead of allowing them to choose how/where they want to download their music to/with. By forcing this nasty non-working software down the throats of your customers, you are losing customers. I refuse to purchase anymore music here. I canÕt spend hours trying to resolve the problems with the nonworking downloads, the freezing, the crashing. ItÕs the end of my business purchasing music here, and I buy a LOT of music. I will also be canceling my subscriptions and other related services. It is hands down the worst software I have ever, ever, ever encountered. Again, Amazon, you should be TOTALLY ashamed of this product and what you are doing to customers. I have been with amazon for many, many years, I think since the beginning actually. Too bad... I am DONE!!!",Amazon
Negative,"Yeah they are asking for more money, but suddenly, I could find all the music I love on this app. I no longer have to go to YouTube and listen to less quality music while keeping my phone open so YouTube works. Every song I want is in this. The annual fee isn't bad at all for not having to worry about paying every month, or not finding your song, or listening to ads. It's really a small price. Plus, I didn't find that they removed songs or at least that many songs from their prime anyway. I honestly don't know what people are so irate about. After all, you get what you pay for. You don't think $99 per year would get you free 2 day shipping, free choices of movies and videos, and unlimited music? Come on people!",Amazon
Negative,"1. If your previously owned music is on an external SD card and you add the same music to Amazon Prime music cloud it will see your previously owned music as ""downloaded from Amazon"" yet expired thus unable to play it. Moving music to internal memory solved problem. Customer support was no use. 2. Doesn't recognize .nomedia files = Audiobooks and everything else is now part of my music collection. 3. Locked in playlists! Doesn't use Android's internal playlist database, can't import/export playlists = lock-in to app, waste of my time, total horse s.... 4. User interface is poorly thought out IMO. For such a big company with such a big music footprint I'm shocked at how bad this app is. Seems the bigger the company the worse the app! Sad cause I really like Amazon Prime but their apps are terrible!",Amazon
Negative,"I wanted to chime in on Amazon Prime Music. I have been using this service for about a year and a half now. I absolutely love the easy access to my music collection whether I am on the internet at work, out in the world with my phone, chilling with my tablet, or enjoying music through the home surround sound Prime Music is ready to go and streams well!  However! I am a serious music collector and I adore having my collection labeled correctly, correct album art, and organised by year of release. Not too much to ask, these are STANDARD music program features since the first Windows Media Player and iTunes....  Well you can not change your album art in Amazon Prime Music! In the year 2015 and after years of complaints in the forums you still cannot do this. Yes, there are bogus work arounds like finding the artwork cache on your PC and pasting new arrowroot in there with the same file name as the bad artwork. However this only affects your PC amazon music player, it does not change on your tablet, phone, website etc. Then there is the method of downloading your album back to your PC, adding it to a better music player, using that music players artwork change feature, and then import it back to Amazon Prime Music which may or may not take it or just paste the wrong artwork on it again! Either way this is ridiculous and for a serious music collection this will take YEARS to correct my collection to my standards. So yeah, this is a MAJOR issue for me that really bugs me. Albums will have the wrong artwork, sometimes 3 albums in a row have the same wrong artwork, and many just don't have artwork at all.  You also are very limited in how you can view your music, no option for sorting or display release years which is another big issue for me. The program also displays your music very literally by artist instead of album artist. What does this mean? Well instead of displaying lets say all of Beyonce's music under one artist heading of Beyonce, Amazon will have 30+ Beyonce artists, one for every Feat she has ever done. The only way to condense this is to change the artist to Beyonce and lose the information on who she is singing with. This is soooooo frustrating!!  When it really comes down to it if i had a better option i would absolutely ditch Prime Music because it is just far too simplistic and limited for my tastes but when you already have a Prime account the price is just too sweet to ignore along with Amazon's fantastic storage limit and bonus features etc. and like i said before, having all your music everywhere and anywhere is pretty awesome! Overall i do like the service but there are just unacceptable issues that frustrate on a daily basis and after over 3 years of this program existing im just left scratching my head at how a giant like Amazon does not fix these issues.... I want to love it Amazon! And it is so easy to fix it so just do it already! I will only hang on so much longer that's for sure!",Amazon
Negative,I tried to get this app to run on my Lenovo Tab and installed it multiple times and all it does is crash. To bad as I wanted to use it with my Prime account. But can't get it to work. Guess I'll use Google play instead. But that means I need to download my songs to my SD card.,Amazon
Negative,"This thing is bad. I've used several others and this is by far at the bottom, which surprised me coming from Amazon. The way you upload a big library like I have to the cloud is atrocious. I have been trying for days to get my approximately 120GB's (and that isn't even that big of a library), up for days. On top of that, they should have an option to point to your music folder and keep track of your personal library and sync your library with your cloud, so its always up to date.  Amazon, get it together.",Amazon
Negative,I'm an international subscriber. I couldn't make use of my prime music nor videos. I couldn't even buy anything. My credit card is accepted for goods purchases but not for music or videos. Apple is doing a better job! Too bad.,Amazon
Negative,"Yesterday the Amazon mp3 app on my phone updated and went from a great app to one of the worst I've ever used. It's very frustrating because I can no longer save music to my sd card, the app has crashed several times, and I am getting a lot of download error messages. It is bad enough that I am considering going tomorrow and buying an IPhone and never buying music from Amazon again. Also a better Prime benefit would have been unlimited cloud drive storage for music rather than a million songs that just take up the very limited storage space on my phone or kill the battery if I try to stream it. It also would be a very good idea to make it available to use on the kindle fire and Fire TV.",Amazon
Negative,"I hate typing bad reviews, but maybe Amazon may listen. I have been using the Amazon Music app on my computer for a few years, so I have experience with it. I am also a Web Developer, so I know how to use a computer. When the latest updates for this app arrived, I was immediately put off. If all you do is play music, it works fine. Uploads are not intuitive at all.  In the older version, when you wanted to upload music, you added it by choosing a file/folder with a browser, or you dragged files/folders onto the app. Then, you saw the list of songs with an uploading icon next to the ones in queue, and the finished ones indicated as such. After uploading, you could clear the queue, so the next time you upload something, you could see exactly what was happening.  Now, you drag files/folders onto the app, as before, but only the songs that are actively uploading or finished are displayed. Unless you counted, you have no idea how many are left to upload. They only get added as they upload. And the queue list shows everything you have ever uploaded, so if I want to see what is in progress, I have to find it in the list. I have thousands of songs. Unless I search for the songs that are uploading, I have no idea it is even working.  This app would be much more useful for me if it would bring back the old upload method. Everything else is not bad.",Amazon
Negative,"Only gave this 2stars because my finger slipped when i tried to give it 1.Buggy and inconsistent, stupid, unreliable, needlessly complicated, totally unnecessary BS!!! I understand that all websites have a mission to make everything proprietary, but proprietary apps should WORK CORRECTLY!!! Remember the good old days when you could just buy an mp3 from amazon and they would just let you download it and enjoy it? Then came the mandatory cloud player, now the mandatory app. Every time i upggrade to a new device amazon makes it harder and harder to download my music library tomy harddrive. This app works less well every time ihave to use it. On my thirdvattempt to download my music to new tablet and half the mp3s simply cant download correctly, even though they downloaded just fine to my previous tablet 6 wks ago. Tried it on several different networks to be sure its not just screwing up due to bad wifi; network is fine. Never paying another dime to amazon for music as long as i live. Enough is enough with this crap.",Amazon
Negative,"UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.  Original Review: No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)  What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.  Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.  Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.  As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.  Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional.",Amazon
Negative,"I have used the ""other"" Mp3 player for years and never liked it. It took up too much room in my devices and is unique to it's own products. I am a freedom loving person and the Cloud player let's me be free. I can buy from many sources and the best part is it doesn't eat up any space on my electronics. The sound quality is superb. Ease of use excellent. When I had a problem today I talked to a specialist in 3 minutes. He took me thru a little tutorial and now I know a lot more than I did before. The streaming has been uninterrupted.  It is an easier, friendlier option to the other one and I am very happy to let Amazon store my music until I want to hear it. I have nothing bad to say about it. If you are new to Mp3 music streaming, I recommend, without hesitation, that you start here. I  I have read the bad reviews and I am sorry to hear people have had trouble with it. My experience has been excellent with all of my devices. Perhaps they have finally worked a lot of the bugs out of it. Anybody who has used Facebook knows about software bugs! Maybe my expectations weren't high. But my experience with Amazon and The Cloud player system overall has been better than most companies I deal with. As I said, I would recommend it to everyone!",Amazon
Negative,"UPDATE:  I find that I use this app less and less. I think the most annoying part is that it ALWAYS tries to sync to your cloud library as soon as you launch it. On the surface, this isn't a bad thing. But the problem is when you don't have solid data coverage or wifi, like in a tunnel or in a building with thick walls. As it tries to sync, the app freezes and you can't do anything but force close it.  Ideally, there should be an option to sync only on wifi or manually by pressing a button. I have several albums downloaded/cached locally and never stream. So the app should just play those local albums and forget about trying to sync any other songs I have in the cloud. Sheesh.  ___________ I downloaded this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. It's actually not a bad app, even if you don't have Prime or don't purchase music. It recognizes/plays non-DRM music that's already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple, responsive, and not annoying. I like it a little more than the Google Music app. And it's much better than all those free apps that either have limited features or annoying ads, unless you pay up.  I'll also echo my complaint here about not being able to store Prime/purchased music on the SD card. It's really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card, but not any of the music. In a perfect world, we'd have unlimited/reliable mobile data everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality is, we still need to download/cache locally to our mobile devices. Hopefully, Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchased music on the SD card.",Amazon
Negative,"The page needs to be refreshed a lot- an issue never experienced with spotify. It's not as bad as youtube where for each video/song you need to click on the tab/window again. (Then again youtube can be used for free.)  Aside from random pausing of music, there is a decent selection of music- some artists I wasn't expecting them to have. Although, many artists are not available and very few are available with a full album collection.  It works for me since I already have prime, which is well worth it for how much I order. I'd give it 4 stars without the streaming errors and 5 with a better selection.",Amazon

Negative,"Before I even checked out the native apps on my new phone, I went to the Amazon store to download this app (along with others previously purchased). I never got past the permissions screen- could not believe how intrusive they have made this app! So I didn't accept the terms, went back and read the reviews. There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory (not the memory card), as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone. Sorry Amazon- I will miss being able to download music directly to my phone from Amazon purchases- but not enough to use your app.",Amazon
Negative,"Music part works fine, but I do not like the ""Turn on Wi-Fi"" permission. Don't need it, don't want it, can't see a valid reason for it. Uninstalled after I noticed my battery level dropping for no reason. My bad, I didn't read the permissions list.",Amazon
Negative,"As far as the apps for Prime Music, the latest Windows version, latest Android/Chrome versions, and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be. There is no music enhancement such as any kind of editor or EQ. I'd like to see a sophisticated sound normalization and EQ option if possible. The Prime Music uploading app (admittedly a separate app that goes with this one and should actually be rolled into this one) does seem in immediate need of a major refresh as it seems long-winded and clunky to use. It should be much more user-friendly plainly speaking. As for the Prime Music Service itself, well because it's free as a Prime member I'm happy for anything that adds value that I'd actually use and benefit from. That said, Prime Music has a long way to go to be an actual music service anyone would want enough to pay for. Yep, if you're paying your going to want Spotify, Tidal, or Pandora. With these services you don't request to listen to Badfinger and get some nameless cover band ""re-recording"" the song which even if you were four or five cocktails in would sound ridiculous compared to the real song. This is a real serious fault of Prime Music and I'm shocked it's even within acceptable legal limits, i.e. the song says it's ""Day After Day"" by Badfinger but it sounds like an attempt (and often a poor one) to sound like Badfinger...So, how can these songs be represented as THE song by THE band??? Here's the bottom line: If Amazon Prime Music is going to be anything other than a free music service (which Amazon hopes keeps Prime customers re-upping due to value) Amazon is going to have to really get access to a VERY LARGE music catalog and do away with the ""bait and switch"" SOUNDS BAD RE-RECORDINGS. And speaking of sound, the fidelity of actual sources are sometimes noticeably not the best (it's likely the source and not the streaming quality itself), I think Amazon needs to raise the fidelity a noticeable notch too.  I've been critical because I do like the fact I can create a playlist of mostly free songs in the cloud. They can be ones Amazon offers as part of Prime as well as my purchases and uploads. This is the best part and I like it. If Amazon will put some of it's muscle and money behind this service it will be not only for current Prime members but will bring an avalanche of new Prime customers.",Amazon
Negative,"The good: No ads Large selection overall Doesn't cut off the last 15 seconds of music (an issue Pandora has never bothered to fix)  The bad: Some genres are rather sparse (in particular heavy metal and alternative) pausing songs for more than a couple of minutes causes the app to replay the song from scratch or shut down altogether The search function really needs some work. I have had better luck searching in my browser than I have in the app from my phone.  In total, this has become the music app of choice for me.",Amazon
Negative,"For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment. First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality. This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you. Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time. Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am Positive that you could develop whatever you want. I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with. Very dissapointed. Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else. Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy. Good luck with your new fire products. Looks like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever.

Negative,I hate the way it's set up. i can't seem to search for the music i want. it seems like i have to scroll down through the available tracks. i'm a technophobe so i'm probably doing it wrong but there are plenty of people like me who want things to be simple and user-friendly.,Amazon

I looked at it today because I'll be on a 10-hr flight this summer (each way) and I need music to listen to OFF-LINE so I don't die from boredom. Whoppie! This is awesome! I'm downloading whole albums of Blues, Jazz, and whatever else I want for free. I was upset last year to learn that I could only download music I PURCHASED on Amazon to my computer, but the reason I wanted to do that is so I could put the music on phone.

Negative,"I needed music for a party for my coworkers retirement. They put me in charge of getting music and I was easily able to find it here on Amazon. That in itself is a blessing. Once I purchased the music I needed, I needed to download this app in order to play it. Normally this would suck and I would hate it but it's made everything so much easier. So I downloaded this app and it has the music that I have purchased right there. I can download the music on my phone so that when I am in the party, it's not using my data in order to play it. It can just play from my phone. I like that part. I have downloaded the music that I purchased and created an album to play my music through for the party so it's easily accessible and ready for use. It also adds my songs that I currently have on my phone so I don't have to manually switch those over. Overall this is a great app, especially if you have prime. There are a lot of songs that you can get for free because of prime.",Amazon

Negative,"I love absolutely LOVE it because it's NOT i Tunes. I hate having to buy music threw a company that will only let me listen to it on their devices (without jumping threw hoops to download it).  Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).  Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.  Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one.

Negative,I really hate writing reviews for apps since I do not necessarily know what to compare to. This app works as expected.,Amazon
Negative,"HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings, deselect auto download, select it again, and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself doesn't indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that's too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows.

Negative,"The interface is terribly confusing and incredibly difficult to navigate. It's hard to figure out how to even get to your music. It's a resource hog. You can't control whether it downloads to your internal memory or SD card. If a download of purchased tracks fails (which it usually does) the ""Download Failed"" message can't be dismissed from your notifications regardless of whether or not the app is running (since some process of it is ALWAYS running).

Negative,"What a terrible service! We already pay $105/year for Amazon Prime, so you'd think the company wouldn't stiff us with ridiculous tactics like graying out songs on my playlists, which I can't play unless I upgrade to the monthly subscription music service! (Why provide the ""free"" service then? (Meaning, the service we already pay $105/year for, in our Amazon Prime membership? And why does the company gray out other songs in my playlist, saying ""this song is no longer available."" ??? A song out of copyright, and more than 70 years old? Really? I believe this is the lowest scummy sort of pressure to try to make customers switch to the paid service. Tell you what. I'm leaving Amazon Prime music and will be very happy paying whatever Spofity charges. I hear they have more songs anyway. Amazon has nothing by Led Zeppelin for example. This Amazon Prime Music is fatally flawed by the company's greed and stupidity.",Amazon
Negative,"This app is a huge resource hog. It has a setting called ""refresh cloud library"" that runs EVERY 10 min whether you want it or not.

Negative,"The Amazon music app is okay. I use it almost everyday. I'm content with the selection provided-occassionaly frustrated by an album I can't listen to. There have been a few errors with the program I've experienced. But, the most egregious is the load time for me to access my music. Somedays I'll hop in my car, excited to listen to some tunes. I click on the app. And I wait a moment. Then some more moments...and it's still loading.  So, a little frustrated, I'll start driving. It couldn't take that long could it?  Sometimes it'll come up after maybe 5 minutes or so. Other times- 15 minutes down the road- The screen still hasn't popped up.  Usually. After reaching my destination, I'll close all screens on my phone log then reopen the program and everything is cool. I do not know about programing, though I know I have a higher end phone, so I can't say 100% who's at fault here- but from the looks of it- others have the same problem with this app.  Anyhow. I'll likely keep using it. I've been roped in with prime- this is basically free- only a few bucks a month- and I can listen to albums after whatever procedures I've come across.  It's not convenient. I don't like it.

Negative,"Today, i've updated the Windows Version of the Amazon Music Software to Rel. 5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400. Because the in software upgrade option didn't work (the update didn't finish / it took forever), I had to remove it manually via Control Center, downloaded the new version and installed it manually. After first start the login screen locked quite crappy, pictures missing, poor contrast, poor dialog layout. However, i've managed to login. In the new software within the thumbnail view, about 60% of the pictures are missing (hate that). If i click some artist and change back to the my music overview the software constantly changes from thumbnail view to list view (really hate that). If i click to prelisten a track in the shop, i'm always getting a message ""a problem has occured"" while everything seems to be working as expected, always have to close this error message before i can select the next track (very very annoying). In the programm settings, i've deselected Auto. Music Import several times now, but Auto Music Import from folder always reactivates itself automagically (why is this option there, if i'm not supposed to change it?). The whole new software feels very laggy in contrast to the old software, although i've got the fastest PC hardware money can buy these days. While i like the Prime service in general (especially free shipment and video) and while i like the prime music idea and having a backup copy of all my music tracks in amazon's cloud, this piece of crappy low budget software makes me reconsider my cloud music backup strategy. And it makes me hate amazon, at least for the next few days. The android app is not much better. I'm going to uninstall both and stick with Spotify and large Micro SD cards in my DAC and my phone. I hope the people at amazon start using their software themselves, try it out!!! Really hoping that amazon music software is going to be fixed soon. At least to a level that doesn't piss the user off, within the fist 10 minutes of use!

Negative,"This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone. The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?",Amazon
Negative,"Prime membership makes this the perfect App for any mobile device, you can either download prime music to your device and for those who are worried about storage can always stream there music online and it's all included with the Prime membership. Lots of music to choose from and all free with your membership, if your song is not available free on prime you can always find deals on entire albums or just buy the songs you like while saving you more money in the long run. Automatically sorts out your music and you can add whatever it is to your digital library. This is very easy to use and would highly recommend using this if you are a Prime Member why pay for another music service when you have already paid for a Prime Membership make the most of Prime.",Amazon

Negative,"I've used several different streaming music apps. Some tried forcing me to upgrade to get rid of ads and others won't force you but the ads are inserted in at ridiculous frequency! I downloaded this to try the no ads steaming with Prime.  I like it! It's really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever. I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels. Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!  The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora. Other than that, I like this app, I can pause, skip and shuffle. It definitely helps my day pass faster when I can listen to music I like while I'm working.",Amazon
Negative,"I don't understand how this app doesn't have all 5 star ratings. There is nothing it could possibly do better. I've stopped using Pandora altogether. Absolutely a must download for any Prime member.  UPDATE: After using this app for several months now, I am still in love with it. The navigation is pretty simple and doesn't require re-thinking all the time. Lyrics display if you want them to, which is a cool feature I've not seen anywhere else. Album art, great selection, the same stuff doesn't play over and over again, it's just great. Also, I haven't noticed an abundance of live albums which always bugged me on Pandora. I don't want to listen to live recordings, I want the studio release! If you love live music and hate studio stuff, I suppose that's an issue.  I continue to add to my library constantly and this is just the #1 music app in my opinion. I don't believe it has the ability to identify a song that is playing on the radio or anything like that, which is an improvement I would like to see. I currently use Google's widget for song identifying, then add it to my amazon library.",Amazon

Poor design.  If anyone knows a better way to exit the application, please let me know.",Amazon
Negative,"I'd been satisfied using the old Amazon MP3 app for some time on my Galaxy S3 and was recently steered into this new ""upgrade"". I don't have Prime so I'm not at all interested in the new Prime features. In practice, I like to download my Amazon MP3 purchases to my phone's micro-SD card so I can play them anywhere without needing to use a network though this has always been a bit more involved than necessary since the old and new app have no option for selecting a different download storage device than my phone's ever shrinking built-in memory.  I have to say the latest version - Amazon Music with Prime Music V4.0.4 - is quite disappointing. When I open the app to download new songs, it immediately displays a message that it is loading cloud songs before I even do anything. It is not clear why the app needs to load cloud songs or why this is taking so long because I have automatic downloads turned off in the app. Whatever the app is doing, it appears to slow the responsiveness dramatically. I then open my Amazon MP3 Library Recently Added list and tap the download icon. It can take a good 10 seconds or more before the app responds and begins downloading. Downloading appears to be much slower than in the old (non-Prime) version over WiFi. And downloading is extremely unreliable -- about one third of my new MP3 fail to download for an unspecified reason. After the list download ends, the app displays a red X next to the Recently Added list which can be pressed to retry downloading. This NEVER seems to work so I often have to scroll through the list of new songs manually, find each failed download and retry each song individually. This works for some songs but, for others, I have to cancel the download and then start a new download for it. During all of this, the app is excessively slow so it takes a while to determine if the app is going to actually retry downloading any particular song. And sometimes the slow response causes the app to switch modes and PLAY the song instead of popping up the retry menu for the song. There's no way to select a group of songs and then retry downloading, each song must be retried individually. After I eventually get all my songs downloaded to the phone, then I have to manually move them to the micro-SD card. Suffice it to say that this entire process is slow, painful and extremely frustrating. It is actually would be much easier and faster to remove the micro-SD from my phone and use my laptop to download my new Amazon MP3s directly to it. The only bright point in all this is that the app now seems to know which songs its already downloaded to my phone (the old version of the app would download songs and albums again and again and rename the files each time so it wasn't easy weed out the duplicates).  Frankly, buying MP3s from Amazon and getting them on my phone has become much too time consuming and frustrating.  UPDATE: Even worse than before. I'm lucky if I can get ONE purchased song to download to my phone Download Failed. Error: 1000 THIS APP IS COMPLETELY BROKEN",Amazon

Negative,"Amazon Music has a good catalog of information available. However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.  1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent. The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms. Play queue being an example. The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.  2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling. I'm forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.  3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist. Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums. This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.  4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application. This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application. This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.  5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks. The ability to thumbs up / down or star tracks is sorely missed.  6. Video Content - None  7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms. If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.  8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow. It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing. This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.  9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to... Show me similar artist, records, songs. Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!  10. Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature. However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.  11. Android Screen controls. The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android. There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).  Overall the service is adequate. There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market. I signed my family up for a year. They all hate it! We will give the service a fair shake over the year. If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again. I expected better from Amazon.

Negative,"Adding my voice here. Currently using up 3.52 GB of my usable 4.94 GB. Refuses to be relegated to SD card storage. Read about some app that will let you move your purchased music to SD but won't move prime music. I guess prime just has to be streamed if you want to use it. Look amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone. You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected. You don't need to hog my internal memory. I guess you are only for top end phone users. I can't afford you.  Listen from the cloud you say? Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and don't let the phone display go dark, the music stops. I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.  So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what? It took the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone. Music that I use other apps to play since those apps don't stop every 15 seconds. Amazon, I love you. But I hate your music app.",Amazon
Negative,"I *hate* the new user interface. I use the app on my FireTV with a Logitech Harmony remote (so no voice control - a worthwhile sacrifice to consolidate all remotes). The new interface completely does away with the ability to jump alphabetically through your songs and albums. You now have to scroll all the way through your library staring with the numbers and slowly making your way through each and every title in your library. I have hundreds of albums and thousands of songs. This interface change has made the music app useless to me, and negated a big part of the reason I bought the FireTV in the first place. I really hope to see this addressed soon.",Amazon
Negative,"I HATE this app. I can't believe Amazon can't get something better designed. As far as maneuvering when using the app, it seems to be extremely sensitive....you can scroll down and all of a sudden what you were working with is gone, or hover over something for a second and you're another spot. My search bar doesn't work, it pulls up nothing, so I've been scrolling to find stuff and I have A LOT of music (see my complaint about scrolling). Much of my downloaded music is missing information and I have to manually fill it in otherwise music isn't where it should be...for instance, I had an album that was downloaded as 12 separate songs because there were no track numbers. I can't click and drag one album or artist to another area, so anything from, say, Joan Jett is separate from anything filed under Joan Jett & the Blackhearts...I have to manually change the info. Many albums have the wrong album cover art, sometimes even belonging to another artist, and some albums have no art whatsoever....there doesn't seem to be a way to copy an image from the internet, so I can't fill it in manually. The app is visually boring. I liked it so much better when you downloaded and it went straight to Media Player...Media Player is a far better app.",Amazon
Negative,"I just bought an album and went to download and while before I could just initialize the download directly into my computer files, NOW it is forcing me to download the Amazon Music App in order to access my songs. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong spot, but the options I once had before are gone. I don't care about whatever features are in this app, I don't need or want them. This takes up space in my hard drive and it's not like iTunes, Xbox Music (which is terrible by the way), or Windows Media Player aren't enough for me. I swear I am deleting this app as soon as it lets me pull my music out of it. To tell you the truth, this is such a pain in the butt that I probably won't download music from here anymore. 0 stars if I could!",Amazon
Negative,"I hate to downrate the app to two stars. Overall, the app is a nice player. Unfortunately, the app forces you to save to the phones (Galaxy3)internal SD card which in my phone does not have sufficient room for my music. The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone. At this time you have two options, root the phone and remap the phones internal SD storage location or copy the music files to the external SD (which breaks playlists).  If Amazon were to fix that one problem I would re-rate the app to 5 stars.",Amazon
Negative,"Uninstalled. It just removes music that you bought through them, the cloud storage is a joke as it is constantly rescanning, songs bought and saved to my sd card don't show up or just won't play. The prime music is not a good deal, as the songs are just removed with no warning (kills whatever Playlist it lives in with it). I play games, videos and other Internet intensive apps with no issue. Amazon plays two songs from MY device and still manages to skip and refuse to play. Utter garbage. No customer support either. Just one maddening phone call after another that translates to 'got your money, sucka!' Officially done.",Amazon
Negative,"The interface it not the easiest to navigate and makes it difficult to perform actions on songs/albums while actively playing music. The process of having to first find a song in the Amazon library, then figure out if it is a Prime music track or only available for additional fee, and finally having to move the song from the Amazon library to your library before being able to play the entire thing is tedious. I should be able to have a standing filter that only shows music I donÕt need to pay extra for and I should be able to stream whatever is presented without having to first add it to some other library. The radio feature is limited to preset stations. There is no continuous playlist option to supplement the active playlist with a radio selection based on the most recent playlist selection.  As far as glitches: When you are lucky enough to find the song you want, and have it be part of the Prime offering, then you have the issue of actually playing the track. Often when trying to add a new song to my library it will indicate it has been added, but then when I go to play the song nothing happens. Sometimes the song will play after a minute or two, but other times you have to exit the application completely and relaunch it to get the new songs to play. This is very frustrating when you simply want to listen to a new song!  And the good stuff: Once you start to play a track there are no hiccups in the audio output. YouÕd think this would go without saying, but a lot of the steaming services that have web based players donÕt seem to be able to get this right, including Spotify and Google Music. Having an application on the desktop is one way to assure smooth playback, although some services seem to be able to make good web players that can do this too. Also, the quality of the recordings sounds good to me, with no loss of quality that I could readily notice due to the applied compression.",Amazon
Negative,"Disappointed that it messed all my music up when it imported it over from i-tunes - it mixed a lot of the album covers up with the wrong albums and tracks and doesn't import all types of audio files.  Also find it a little frustrating to navigate through.  The idea is great, but I feel I have wasted my £21.00 yearly subscription and could have spent it better on another product.",Amazon
Negative,"I like the Amazon music service and the new Prime Music seems like a great idea, but when I discover new music and want to download it so I can listen to it without being connected it doesn't always work and is very frustrating. If they make it more simple and allow music to be stored to external memory card I would be happy and be able to purchase slot of music. I miss the old player so I use the standard player that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3á",Amazon
Negative,So far it seems fine. The only down side is it doesn't show the album art work for albums in my library that weren't purchased thru amazon. The artwork is on my computer but doesn't carry over to Amazon Music. Frustrating!,Amazon
Negative,"This app has had a few iterations and I appreciate the complexity of adapting a program like this in an agile fashion, But, routinely there are changes that are not thought-through and the constant changes in functionality, removal of some functionality and lack of comprehensive design principles can be very, very frustrating. My latest gripe is the ""download playlist"" button that loads a second after the button right next to it, which is ""shuffle playlist."" Several times now I've gone to push the ""shuffle playlist"" button and then the ""download playlist"" button loads into it's place. Now my phone is slowed down in attempts to download the playlist. When all I wanted to do was listen to the playlist! Rrrrrr. Sometimes I wonder if anyone at Amazon actually uses the product. I do, everyday, and I would love to help (re)design it. Just a bit more attention to design principles is all I ask.",Amazon
Negative,This is not quite as user friendly as I would like - hard to find and get to songs you have in your library. Wish I could better explain it but it is just frustrating at times. I love having PRIME but wish this app was easier to utilize.,Amazon
Negative,"For some reason, it does not play on my Android devices. The loading icon (little orange circle) just rolls around and nothing happens. But then my Amazon Echo can tell that I'm trying to play something. It's very frustrating especially since I'm paying for it.",Amazon
Negative,This is a fast easy to use app that brings music right to your phone. I love being able to download the music onto my phone instead of transferring it from PC to phone. I also love that your purchases are saved in the cloud. Everyone knows how frustrating it is when your phone goes crazy and you lose everything. With this app you can put it right back with a few simple steps. It's great.,Amazon
Negative,Like the concept but Amazon Music does not explain how to use it ---- frustrating as its by chance you learn,Amazon
Negative,"decent selection of music, streaming is limited. Frustrating (and infuriating) that it's not compatible with Chromecast. Good for road trips if you have the data.",Amazon
Negative,"This is really frustrating because can't even open the app after successfully installing it. Plus, why can't Amazon consolidate all as under one or two cause it is confusing.",Amazon
Negative,"I need to play around with Amazon Prime music some more, to figure it out, but my initial reaction is not Positive. My breakdown after 1 day or so looking at it:  I found it difficult to navigate the app, particularly with respect to what is included as Prime Streaming and what is not. More specifically, it's frustrating that the ""Prime"" (i.e., no additional cost) music is sort of mixed in with all the stuff that is for purchase.  With Google Play Music, it takes some effort to actually go and purchase something. Basically what you find in Google Play Music streaming is available to you for unlimited streaming and included in your subscription cost.  With this service, I'm wary that I might click on something and end up buying it. Maybe that is the point, really.  Amazon needs to clearly separate the ""free"" (i.e.included in Prime subscription) streaming music from the rest for this app to be very useful.",Amazon
Negative,"every month the list changes, what you got through prime one month may disappear the next. frustrating",Amazon
Negative,"Easy to navigate, good songs, no adds, great overall music app. Had to subtract a star because closing the app completely can be a little frustrating.",Amazon
Negative,Extremely frustrating!! Amazon keeps telling me that my password is not valid. I keep changing it and they keep saying that it is not valid. I can easily access the cloud music from my PC.......phone doisn't know that it exists....just keeps telling my the my password is not valid.,Amazon
Negative,i have downgraded my review of this app. first pro is that you can download music for offline play. if you have an android device (for example my galaxy tab A) you can put that downloaded music onto the ext card. pro: i love the curated playlists that amazon creates. now the con which knock off 2 stars - IT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING & CONFUSING APP I HAVE EVER EVER ENCOUNTERED. once you add an album or playlist to your library GOOD LUCK IN FINDING IT LATER. if you add more than one album it adds them all in a row of songs instead of individual albums - AGAIN SO FRUSTRATING AND CONFUSING. many times i get so frustrated that i just into recents and play that. why does it have to be the opposite of user friendly?,Amazon
Negative,"I like the idea of amazon music, but the execution is very poor. When I'm driving, which is when I tend to listen to music, the music stalls and stutters. I can rarely get through an entire song. It doesn't seem to matter whether I'm playing music from the cloud or if it's downloaded. Even the streams you've created don't work properly. Very frustrating.",Amazon
Negative,"App doesn't work on my Android (Samsung Note). It had worked fine for quite some time and then one day stopped working properly. I went through Amazon ""tech support,"" which was a joke. The tech told me the problem was that I didn't have the latest version. It was a real hassle to download the latest version because I first had to download some Amazon App which is equivalent to a play store. The tech informed me that if I downloaded it elsewhere (like from other play stores or even the Amazon site) it wouldn't be the latest version. In the end it still didn't work, so the tech did some more checking and then told me they were having issues with Samsung devices but were working on it. Very frustrating and a big waste of time. Amazon Music works fine on my iPhone and, of course, through my Fire TV, but the music is very limited if you're not into pop stuff. This made the whole experience even worse because it wasn't worth my time. Amazon really needs to get it together if they expect to compete with Pandora and Spotify. .",Amazon
Negative,"Wants to much access to my phones private content. Stalls, freezes, shuts down constant. Removed after 10 frustrating minutes of restarting.",Amazon

Negative,"I can search for music on my device by song, album and artist. When I use it to search amazon for music to purchase, I cannot search by artist. Such a little thing yet exceptionally frustrating!",Amazon
Negative,"Like others have said, I too consider this the absolute worst application I have ever used. Why, Amazon, have you made this so difficult? I have spent 25 years in IT, and believe me when I say, this is the most frustrating and non-intuitive application I have ever used. The only way I have found to use this is to download it to my computer first and then copy and paste the songs/albums to my Android device!! Really?? In this day and age?? Did you not test this before dumping this on us?? I have other problems with this thing, too, but I just don't have the time to go into it, and besides, I am not here to be your beta tester and right now, this is worse than beta software.",Amazon

Negative,"Amazon.does it AGAIN, tempting us with services they CANNOT provide. If you have some other device, MAYBE it will work. All I know is, it is majority frustrating to be offered "" millions of songs- FREE!"" only to find the app I need to.play said songs DOES NOT WORK ON KINDLES. YOU SUCK AMAZON. Better to not.even.offer.",Amazon
Negative,"I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs & limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.  The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.  It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.  Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.  Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...  It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.  I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am Positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.  Thanks for reading my review.",Amazon
Negative,"I really want to love this app. I really do. Having legally free music is appealing and having good recommendations made has certainly increased the library of music I'm playing.  But this app is absolute garbage. It was designed by someone that never has used a music app before. Maybe it's my phone? I have some spare cell phones, I'll try this on to see if I experience the same issues and update my review.  For reference, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (t-mobile variation) and I'll be testing it on my Nexus 5 (old model) and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus (T-mobile variation) and a Samsung Galaxy S3 if it powers up.  So here are the huge glaring issues with this app and service:  1) You can only upload 250 songs to the cloud. That's pitiful. Amazon is the damn king for cloud computing. I refuse to believe they can't easily and at low cost up that number. Google play music (which I was using before) let's you upload 50,000 songs. A 250 limit severely restricts us and I refuse to rebuy my music catalog from amazon mp3.  2) If you add more music to your playlists from your computer, and you hit download on your app instead of it just downloading the new tracks you added onto the same playlist (ie Favorites) it creates a new playlist (Favorites 01) it doesn't redownload everything, but it's a nuisance. In a year what will I be at? Favorites 69?  3) Why can't think app sync with the music app on my Amazon Fire Tv? With google play music I can connect to google play on my chromecast and play my music on my surround system, I want to do that on here as well so I don't have to constantly skip tracks I've already heard recently.  4) This is the by far the biggest frustrating issue for me.....and related to # 3. This app has never once played a playlist all the way through. And it is INFURIATING. What's the point of having a 800 song playlist if it keeps restarting!?! I listen to music on the way to work and I'll get to track 8 of 800 and when I drive home in the afternoon I should be able to resume on track 9 of 800. But it doesn't. It. Keeps. Restarting. So I spend most of time skipping tracks, because ""i just heard that this morning, heard that yesterday."" Google Play Music never once had this issue.  I want to hear a playlist all the way through. I want to get home, sync the app to amazon fire tv and listen to music as I wash dishes, then go to the gym and continue my playlist. And I want to not have the playlist keep starting over again every time I open the app.  I switched from Google Play Music because of the allure of all that free prime music, and it has introduced me to some really great stuff I'd never heard before. But the app is currently a broken mess.",Amazon
Negative,"I've been using Amazon Music for a few years, and enjoyed downloading purchases to my android phone so I can play my own music in my car. Now, however, I can't get through a single song through the car without an error message (exception 180) that stops the player cold. The error messages suggest I ""try again,"" but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I've PAID FOR from my device. This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Now, I have to find a music player that doesn't hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music won't play on any other player, that I've tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper. And, from what I'm seeing on these message boards, Amazon customer service hasn't even bothered to address this issue with the customers who present it. What a big FAT disappointment, Amazon.",Amazon
Negative,"I love this app. Well, I LOVED this app. After one update, and then another, it's less and less helpful. All the music I own is through Amazon, plus I'm a PRIME member, so I should be able to play all the PRIME music for free. But it's not working out. Music I've bought and paid for is downloaded onto my phone and then immediately deleted without my permission. PRIME music won't play. And other songs that I've deleted from my phone keep re-downloading - again, without my permission. And other songs that do play when tap on them individually, won't play in a playlist. It's very frustrating. I've deleted and re-downloaded this app several times, but nothing helps. And every update makes things worse. I just want the original app back so I can buy and play my music!",Amazon
Negative,"Had my hard drive die on my pc. Installed new drive, downloaded Amazon Music to get my cloud music.......... Nothing is there !!

Negative,"Nearly perfect. I did need to re-install the app following problems. I bought an Anker Bluetooth speaker, and I needed to re-install the app on my smart phone. Once I did it runs perfectly. Until then it was frustrating.",Amazon
Negative,"This app is great when it works. However, in the last few months it is constantly freezing after playing only a few songs (offline) and recently in the last few weeks, it will either not launch my library or it will hang up before a song loads to start playing. It is extremely frustrating and I would not consider this app or service when deciding to purchase Amazon Prime, because it is so unreliable. If this was a free service, I would expect some issues occasionally. I expect so much better from Amazon. Maybe Wal-Mart or one of the other competitors that Amazon used to dominate will jump in and make an app that just simply works.",Amazon
Negative,"Phone: Nexus 5, 32GB.  1) 99% of the time, I use Amazon MP3 to play my Amazon Cloud songs. I generally list items by Album. Well, when I finish listening to an album, go back to the album list and try to play another, it NEVER works. It just hangs. So every time I'm done with an album, I have to completely close and re-open the program. This is extremely frustrating, especially when listening to complilations because....  2) Compilations are not grouped under one album. Every single song lists the exact same album name, yet Amazon MP3 creates a separate album for every artist. So you can't just click on an comp and let it play. You have to go back and choose a new song every time, which is maddening when you consider problem #1 above. I'm guessing Amazon would respond that there's something in the metadata that doesn't flag it as a comp, but come on. If I'm in album view, just combine the albums with the same name.",Amazon
Negative,"I loved it, then there was an ""upgrade"" that broke everything... my main pain was losing lock screen controls, and shuffled lists... Well, finaly in update #3 or #4, the stuff is back! Amazon MP3 on my Android is usable again! I know if I had blue tooth radio, I could do without it, but as I do not - I depend on an easy way to skip a track - without unlocking the phone. I almost wish there were ""hot zones"" active if the phone is dark.. but whayt is there, is better than nothing, as was the case till few weeks ago! Not 5 stars, as the app could be better, and changes break it from time to time.. but certainly back to 4 stars!",Amazon

Negative,I want to like this but it's a huge pain in the butt. It duplicates every song that I downloaded for offline listening which doubles the space used on my phone. When I delete it all it just does it again 5 minutes later making it where I have no space for anything else,Amazon
Negative,"It used to be a workable app, but pushing prime up front makes it a pain to just listen to music on my phone. I tried one &#34;Prime&#34; song today and it played ok, but if I paused or tried to switch songs it didn't respond, then after several tries it would perform the actions I'd tried in order sometimes 20+ seconds apart, so the track would go back to the start and play for a little while and start over, then it would play a little and switch to the previous track, then after a bit the track before that. Then about 6 hours after I first got the &#34;Prime&#34; song I tried to play it again and the app said it was no longer available, then removed it from my list. Lame! Plus since this is such a big overhaul of the app it shouldn't have the benefit of a couple of years worth of 3, 4 and 5 star reviews.

Negative,"I loved the Amazon mp3 Player! Bit with each update it lost some of its appeal. Now it's totally lost it. And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it?

Before this last update I would have given the app 5 stars. I hope that they fix what they screwed up. No longer a fan.",Amazon
Negative,"Your app is very limited that sometimes it gets close to absurdity.  1. I expended over a $100 in your store to get a 128GB memory card. I have not taken advantage of it because your app doesnÕt allow specifying in which folder I want the music to be downloaded. I have to maneuver and keep transferring the music manually which is really aggravating. At times, if I have no done a recent transfer to the memory card and I will not be at home in a while, IÕm in such need of memory that I have to clear the whole Amazon music from my phone. The start the whole process again.  2. To free up memory from my device, I selected the voicemails messages to be downloaded to the memory card. Your app makes them part of the library. Worse than that, I canÕt delete them all at once or better, just delete them from the library but keep them stored in my phone. At times I had deleted over 20 voice mails one by one from the app library. That how stupid it becomes.  3. Same as #2, I have downloaded complete playlists from Prime. I discover songs that I donÕt like and I donÕt know how to get rid of them while keeping the rest of the library intact.  4. I can't play my music offline and wasting my cell phone data streaming. When I try to play music supposedly downloaded to my cellphone, I get an error message with a ""Exception #180"" code  It is such a painful waste of time when you can solve that in less than an hour. That is why you hire software engineers and geeks. Any of them can take care of all of the above during lunch time.",Amazon
Negative,"Finally this lousy app allows you to download the music YOU OWN directly to your MicroSD card, which I understand was a problem with Android, not Amazon (the problem occurred with many other non-Amazon apps).  That being said... this app still needs major work.  DLs of music I bought/own don't always work, but there's no indication from the app that they didn't complete. So you think you have the whole song, and instead you have only half or less.  On top of that, it is SUCH A PAIN to try to delete and reDL the song, because this must be done from completely different screens and requires stepping back through multiple menus. It is neither easy nor intuitive.  As a Prime user, I'm allowed to DL some Prime music I *don't* own for offline listening. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. The app won't tell you why.  There's no way to remove the gaps between songs the way they would sound if playing a CD or album. There are FREE apps that let you do this or let you crossfade, which this app also doesn't let you do.  There's NO graphic equalizer. Again, there are free music player apps that do this!",Amazon
Negative,"The app needs some improvement in order to make it more user friendly. It has a very generic setup. The biggest pain is getting your library move over from another service like Apple Music. It's not easy if you have playlist you want to keep in place without having to make new ones. Sorting is limited, very limited columns selections in your songs catagory (roughly 2 choices vs Apple Music has over 40 choices). It has a duplicate choice in advance settings, but there is no option(or a way) for the user to run a duplicate command like Apple Music. Preference tab is very limited as well. These things makes this service well behind Apple Music, but like any other service it can be improved. The one big advantage Amazon music has over Apple is price. Amazon does offer 2 months off for a full year subscriptions vs Apple which offers no discount which is why I decided to give Amazon a try.",Amazon
Negative,"So buggy, i wouldn't use it if it didn't come with prime. I can't believe that amazon finds it acceptable. Music will often not load or the app will crash out mid session, if you make a playlist that has online and online music it can't play offline (just skip the online). I will download music and it still acts like it online music only. The app will turn on randomly and play music (happened once in a meeting which wasn't cool). In addition its painfully hard to exit the program on your phone, its like one of those bloatware apps that just wont go away once you opened it. It is easy to find free music or purchase music though and works on both iphones and androids. The iphone app seems to be less buggy then the android (no surprise).",Amazon
Negative,"As a Prime member this is a nice way to get music since you have access to hundreds of artists and genre of music. But the app is designed piss poor and is not user friendly at all.  First, the interface is PAINFUL to use. Not only does the app NEVER keeps your music last listened to in check, there is no real way to make a Playlist, keep recently played music in check or even find what you last listened to. Sometimes the app saves it but half the time I am looking for what I last listened to which is annoying!  Secondly, the UI is confusing. It list cloud, Prime music, library and store but it never really has the list right for what you were listening to or want to listen to. It is just really a pain to find music I want to hear, even my own music!  Thirdly, how do you make a Playlist? I still haven't figured that out. The app is so painful to use I really haven't bothered.  If you just want to listen to music it OK for that. The app itself is a mediocre music player.",Amazon
Negative,"Adding songs to your playlists is a pain. Rather than the normal way of searching for a song and then adding it to your playlist you first have to add it to you library, then you have to go into your library and search for the song again, then you can choose to add it to your playlist. And the biggest problem is that there is no SD card support. Many phones have limited storage, but Amazon doesn't care about us people with older phones. It makes the app nearly worthless.",Amazon
Negative,"OK, have been a prime customer just about ever since I can remember. Joined Prime Music this year, took a while to get use to it over Pandora, but was fine until today. Went to my favorite play list and there were a bunch of songs that were Prime music and use to play all the time, and now the Prime logo is greyed out, and a prompt comes up with remove or buy. Truly a bait and switch tactic, that could almost be considered against the law. Second issue, last month I uploaded or I should say tried to upload discs out of my personal library. What a pain, they would only allow certain songs to be uploaded to my prime account, dialog box stated: incompatible format. Odd, they play on everything else I own. Most likely a licensing or royalty issue. Not at all happy now. I had a Stevie Ray Vaughn album that was all Prime Music, went to play today, all greyed out, they want me to buy now.Iit wasn't uploaded, don't own a copy. I will provide an update if I hear from them. I don't like surprises, don't think anyone does.",Amazon
Negative,"I'm fairly computer literate and this is a painful application/service to use. This is especially true if you have a large library to upload to the cloud. I'm talking weeks of babysitting this thing to get them there.  Also, the app is very slow to respond when scrolling around in My Library. There should be a local index so this doesn't happen. Of course, the Store browsing works reasonably well since they only have tiny web pages (a couple of screens long).  This service is a valuable component to the Alexa universe. Pleeeeeze, Get it right. It honestly seems like Amazon really doesn't want you to use your music you already own, in favor of a streaming service. It may be fine for some, but personally, I don't want Amazon feeding me music via streaming. I want MY music. Think about this.... What if your parents told you what was popular and you had to stream from that.",Amazon
Negative,"I gave it one star because I could not give it zero. Nothing works on this system. The help desk is not useful either (although they tried), and the software is anything but user friendly.

Negative,"the worst app for moving music i have ever seen, im fan of amazon and using alexa with amazon echo a lot, but this app is something out of ordinary, you realy have to make an effort to design app so poor. what i think most people will use this all with their amazon prime subscription is upload music and then listen to echo when needed... but whole process is so slow and complicated, its not even worth using it. after few hours of trying to upload, i only managed to made my Echo play 10-20 of my music, out of 100s i tried to upload. whole process is designed to be worst possible user friendly one. i think only person who will understand whats going is the guy who wrote the program. realy hoped that thery will change interface of do something with this app. but 5 months passed and nothing.  realy disappointed with amazon.... as said in the beguiling im real fan and admirer of whole amazon chain but this is just CRAP!!!",Amazon
Negative,"The absolute worst streaming music app I have ever used. It constantly stops streaming regardless of the device I am using to listen to music. This happens on any network when I attempt to use the device. It even stops on my Kindle. You would think it if was going to work, the best option would be on the Kindle but nope. I have no problems with Spotify or Pandora ever stopping. If I wasn't a Prime member, there is no way I would ever use this completely useless services.",Amazon

It is slow, sluggish, and difficult to navigate. The screen is so cluttered, you can't find anything. When playing a playlist on a PC, you can't even read the song title.",Amazon
Negative,"This service has been atrocious. Only iTunes is worse. Although iTunes can handle more than 40k songs...... I am a person who has a huge audio collection, and I own an echo, so I'm forced to use Amazon Music for my server to upload my music so I can listen to it on my echo's. This has been a cluster since I was in the beta.... every time they upgrade, it gets worse and worse. After this last update, when I open it, I get an error message that says there is no disk in the drive, and It wont go away, and Amazon Music locks up..... can't use it at all. I've uninstalled and re-installed, and it does the same. About six months ago I called in for support, and they said it could not handle over 40K songs, but I was only at 33K. Still they said it was due to high song amount. I pay amazon so that I'm supposed to be able to upload up to 250K songs. That is not even the worst. I have a compilation set with 4 albums, and Amazon made a different album for each song. It is fraught with issues all the way through, and I have been telling amazon for almost a year about these issues, and it just keeps getting worse. I hope they fix it someday, as I love the Echo... but can't stand this program.",Amazon
Negative,"As someone who has used quite a lot of different apps with musical capabilities, for work as a musician and personal use, I can say with confidence that this is the worst app for listening to music it has ever been my misfortune to be forced to use. Force closes for no reason, terrible organization, storage and RAM hog, causes phone to freeze to the point that I have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it, and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long. Seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through Amazon Prime, I guess I'm stuck with this crappy app. Otherwise I am going to use the slightly less glitchy Google play music. Seeing as I am paying for this mangled service, and assume some of my payment is going to app development, I'm highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from Amazon. Good music selection, but difficult to listen to and enjoy if the app doesn't work.",Amazon
Negative,"This software is getting more unpredictable on my Galaxy S5 as time goes on. It will not allow me to put new purchases on my SD card on my phone. I don't like having to stream music while out on my runs because it uses up my data from Verison. When I do stream, it often changes to a different album on it's own. I also like using Power Amp because it works predictably and the sound is much better. Even the headset buttens in Amazon are unpredictable. I have not been able to upload the last album to my phone. Sometimes it will down 1 to 3 songs but will not download the entire album. Your music software has turned to the worst software I have ever used on my phone. Factory reset doesn't help. .",Amazon
Negative,after several years with this app and no problems something changed and all I have is problems of which the worst is that I can no longer play the music I own and downloaded on my computer.,Amazon
Negative,"I'm using the IOS app. It actually works pretty well. It seems that some albums in my library need a little update in the metadata, and it will be easier to find the stuff I'm looking for.  I've got about 30k songs in my collection. I'm trying to upload all those so that I can access them across all my devices (including my echo). The Amazon music program on the PC and MAC are by far the worst cloud upload program I have ever worked with. Let me list the problems:  1) I've got a 4-core 8-thread core i7 machine, it maxes out all my CPU in order to do 3 parallel streams of uploading. On my macbook pro, it shows 110% CPU on a 4 core machine. Uploading a file should not be a CPU intensive process. It slows down my entire PC, where typing stuff into a web browser is about 1 character a second. 2) The underlying threads kindof work (I get lots of ""Cloud Service Not Responding Errors""), you have to go back through and ask it to retry files one at a time. Because it's so slow, it takes about 30 seconds to actually select, hit retry, and click ""got it"" and have the popup dissappear. 3) The UI hangs, so you have no idea what it's actually doing. I have to resort to hitting refresh on the browser on the website to see what has actually been uploaded. It gives a popup when the upload is complete, but that only happens about 20% of the time (if you're uploading 5 songs at a time). If you upload like 100 songs at once, then it just hangs and shows busy forever (even hours after it completed uploading the last file). You have to quit the program, and go into the task manager and actually kill it. I now do that between every upload.  Amazon solutions are typically very good. The kindle programs work amazingly well. This one is total crap, which is a shame for an otherwise very good service (from what I can tell). If they can get this fixed, then their offering should be very competitive.",Amazon
Negative,"I figured that after a little time and updates Amazon would have this app cleaned up, this is not the case. App crashes on a daily basis Music skips when it tries to find wifi signal for my offline music.

Negative,"***THE WORST MUSIC SOFTWARE***  1. Doesn't play the majority of the songs I've uploaded. 2. Sometimes replaces album art with incorrect ones. 3. Sometimes deletes lyrics from various songs (not really relevant since the Amazon Music Player doesn't display lyrics, unless that feature is enabled and then you're left with songs without lyrics)  Amazon refuses to play most of my songs that were uploaded to the cloud. These are original mp3 or m4a files. I don't understand what the problem is. Some play, some don't. Why?  I did find a workaround that involves uploading, downloading, and then uploading again. That's right: upload the song, then download it back to your computer, delete the original uploaded song from Amazon's cloud server, and then re-upload the downloaded song. It appears that certain things are delete from the original uploaded, such as lyrics. Maybe Amazon doesn't like certain lyrics? Who knows!!!",Amazon

There are extremely long pauses while browsing my collection and frequent force closes. I really would prefer the functionality and layout of Amazon's app, but the horrible lag in browsing the UI is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this app for large music collections.

Why? Why? Why? My Galaxy Note II has just 16GB of internal memory, which is needed for programs, etc. There is not much space to store a bunch of music. That's why I bought the SD card (from Amazon!). Google Music let's you download to SD - you can too!  2) It will let you download your music, but still streams it from the cloud I was enjoying listening to my music from the Amazon cloud so much that I was pushing against my Verizon data limits. No problem, I thought, I'll just use the handy download function in the app. So, before a big car trip I created a playlist and clicked the download button. On the drive I pulled up the playlist and started to play it. Everything seemed great until I lost the 4G signal and the music stopped. What happened? Hadn't I downloaded the songs? Well, yes, the songs had downloaded to my phone, but the stupid Amazon MP3 player was still streaming the songs over the Internet, even though it ""knew"" that it had already downloaded them all.

Negative,"I get the ""Prime"" version with my prime account for free otherwise I wouldn't use it. The app itself is pretty looking but the functionality is average and the music service itself is below average.  The real benefit of Amazon Prime Music is no commercials otherwise every other music app (Pandora, Slacker, etc.) is much better in every way.  The available music is limited and music stations in Amazon Prime Music are horrible. My guess is that it's because they want you to buy the unlimited music service or because they'd have to pay the artist and don't want to in a ""free"" service. Example: The other apps have a ""top pop station"" where all the latest and greatest is played and the selection is excellent. Amazon Prime Music - not even close. Amazon claims these stations / play lists are created by experts. I'd add say it differently....they're created by experts who are limited by the music available.",Amazon
Negative,"I've used the music app for years, mostly the iOS version and a few months ago started using the Fire Tv/Stick version and thought it was all right. The version just released recently is absolutely horrible however. No longer can you click on a song and select ""artist"" or ""album."" You just have the option to play it. A quick way of playing an album I recently purchased or uploaded was to just find it in the ""recently added"" playlist. Now you can just click on an individual song and listen to the entire playlist. What is really egregious though is when you go to ""my music"" you can get to your songs, artists or albums and they are in alphabetical order as before but what is missing is the alphabet menu shortcut we had before where we could jump to an artist like Joyce Manor for example, just by quickly scrolling to the J. Now you have to scroll through each individual artist name by name which if you have a large library can take quite a while. I feel like I'm being pushed by Amazon into relying on playlists and using the music app as if it was Pandora or something. I prefer my own library and that's what I want to play but this app makes that more challenging.",Amazon
Negative,"Amazon Music, not quite ready for ""prime""time, and if I had to pay for the service, I'd request my money back.  Heres why I say this. First, create your own playlist. It's kinda good, the prime catalog is lacking, and I have yet to discover the magic bean that will allow me to add my local music on my PC to playlists on my phone (same account) that I can achieve VIA google music. Add to that I added 500 songs to my prime playlist.. It repeats the same 20 songs, I don't even hear some artists I've added.  Then came the ""stations"" these in theory are great, Pandora killer I thought.. But holy crap are the stations HORRIBLE. lets try punk rock. I hear the same 13-18 songs repeated. Half of which aren't really in the genre. Lets switch to the stations titled ""Van Halen"" One van halen song, then you'd expect a high energy classic rock song, nope.. Lets toss on something a lot slower by abba, stevie knicks or Fleetwood mac. Yeah, they're in the same class.  Long song? No problem.. We'll cut it off before it ends...  Add to that the app likes to stop playing, then start again, then stop again.. When writing this review I turned on the van halen station, connected to 4G, it would play one song and stop. Connected to work wifi, still played one song and stopped. Finally rebooted my phone, Plays one song and stops.. Not the best app in the pool at this time. Absolutely doesn't enhance my prime membership yet. Keep trying amazon..",Amazon
Negative,"It's gone from mediocre to freaking horrible. I left itunes because they screwed up their program a two years ago. And recently amazombie followed suit. It takes twenty minutes for me to access the music and it's molasses if I try to add a new playlist. It's the freaking cloud connection. Let me download all the music and you fix the problem. You can still manage the digital rights and we don't have to wait for your crappy servers to decide to let me access my music. Most disappointing amazon experience by far.  Update May 2017 - They seemed to have streamlined the software code. Running better. Still kind of slow but a useable experience.",Amazon
Negative,"This app is horrible the interface is clunky and hard to use, for instance the song options in the music library are right under the slidy bar so you scroll down find the song your looking for got to bring up the options and it sends you wizzing off to some other corner of the library because you clicked the scroll bar! Total garbage save your self the frustration and just avoid this whole s***show.",Amazon
Negative,"Latest version is horrible. Performance is worse and the app is now buggy. The UI hasn't improved and think it is worse than previous version.

Negative,"I've been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service. Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it. Well, I'm wrong. My husband has already declared ""it sucks!"". But I don't listen as often and I have more ""mainstream"" tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no. Here is a short list of why I don't like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible. So much so that, even though it's essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I'd rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app. The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain won't recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud. Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are ""re-recorded""versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song. I've not run across this with Spotify or Google Play. What's the deal with this scam?  In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song (good luck if you can find it on Prime Music) . But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else.",Amazon
Negative,"Confusing, horrible interface. CANNOT UNINSTALL UPDATE once you apply it. Cloud/Device tabs are gone and how you find your existing music is a complete mystery. Impossible to tell whether you're purchasing music or getting it through Prime. I'm uninstalling this app completely. Amazon Prime music is definitely not ready for prime time. Thanks for pushing out a crappy app without giving me the ability to roll back to the old, much more elegant interface.",Amazon
Negative,"I was really excited at first. As a Prime customer I was thrilled to see I had access to 1 million songs. And a lot of the songs on offer are right up my alley. The first day I added over 200 songs to my library.  But the Android App is now nearly unusable. It was great before but now is just horrible. I've been able to listen to maybe five of these songs in the last week as this app is so buggy. It won't load. It crashes frequently. The song pauses every few seconds due to poor, slow streaming quality. The app is also an enormous resource hog. It takes up most of the RAM and drains the battery. My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all. I love that it remains ""running"" when it doesn't even work.  The desktop program is tolerable. It was annoying trying to install flash in chrome and took a long time to set it up but I can live with that. I cannot tolerate the phone app. If things don't improve soon I will uninstall it and will also not renew my Prime Membership.",Amazon
Negative,Forced new update is a complete disaster. Horrible interface that take more time/work to get anything done. Tons of music I never uploaded to the app is now there that I have to go through to make my playlists. I love that if I contact Amazon to complain and ask to go back to the old app their only answer is that you can't once you've installed it. That's nice except for I didn't install it. I'll have to see if I can get my music onto my echo with some other program or through it in the trash where it belongs now that this garbage has been forced on me.,Amazon
Negative,"The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate, and it does what it should. Performance though is a problem. I've used this on my HTC One M7, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S5.all of them have terrible performance. On wifi, it is just barely acceptable. Over 3g or even 4g, it takes an almost obscene amount of time to start streaming. This may be expected when on lower bandwidth connections, but it isn't just that it is buffering. It takes up 90 percent cpu time, impacting anything else I am doing. Seeing the same behavior on 2 M7s, plus the tablet and the S5,indicates it is an app problem. Initially I thought it was a side effect of the initial synching, but the problem continues days later.  On the Positive side, being able to download so you can listen offline is great. As I said, the app itself is easy and intuitive for the most part. If the performance can be addressed it will be a great app. As it is, it is relegated to occasional use.",Amazon

Do u really need to gouge me for more money?  I'll be downloading everything from my Amazon cloud and using the Google player.",Amazon
Negative,"This crap will not install! Tried numerous times, read tons of reviews of others with the same problem. Amazon tech can't get it to work either. This app is junk and amazon prime delivery is terrible also, they're consistently late but they're late taking my hundred bucks. They blame it on the UPS, USPS AND OTHER CARRIERS. ALL THIS IS AMAZONS MISMANAGEMENT!!! Love to see Amazon bankrupt",Amazon
Negative,"App crashes if I try to use it without an internet connection, and gives frequent errors while streaming. Haven't been able to listen to a single full album. Just terrible",Amazon
Negative,"terrible reinstalled it twice and doesn't work ,keeps telling me there is a problem with my prime subscription which there isn't.",Amazon
Negative,"I like its customizable folders album and artist options, but it sucks up WAY too much data to be regularly useful.  Update October 2016  I finally got used to the process of uploading and customizing, and they changed the whole thing, preventing the organizing of folders, songs, albums as we would like. Now it is virtually useless and unwieldy, with side bars expanding, and extremely difficult to simply look through folders.  This is absolutely terrible. If I hadn't spent so much time putting stuff on to it, I would never use nor continue with it.",Amazon
Negative,"I was expecting a bit more from this app.Don't get me wrong though,it's not entirely terrible.A few things I liked about it was the addition of lyrics to some songs and how simple it was to look for music and buy an artist's album. However,I did experience some issues.The fact that when I was listening to a song and lost my internet connection, the song would start all over and you're forced to listen to the entire song all again once connection has been restored.Another thing I disliked about Prime Music was the fact that there's not many artists.Only really known ones.One of the things that really bugged me a bit was the fact that the app needed a lot of my private information.Like no thank you.I ended up uninstalling the app for that reason and since it took up a lot of space on my phone.I'd rather stick to Pandora.",Amazon
Negative,While I love the music the app on my Samsung Note 3 is terrible. It fails repeatedly. It give me a message with a code and tells me to contact customer service. Why does the app not send this report itself? Once the error starts it is hard to even clear as it just keeps retrying the function and errors out again. Today I was just trying to edit a playlist. I have to reboot the phone after I add or delete 3 or 4'songs as the errors start. I don't want to call customer service. Oddly now as I poke around it seems picking up the phone is my only option. Nowhere is the online chat support? Send a text or email?,Amazon
Negative,"This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I've got that done there's no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by (say) Artist I've got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.  Searching isn't terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, ""m"" there's no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I'm moved to a different search tab. This isn't rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you're this app is doing isn't better.  Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it's laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. There's a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I'm forced to use it when (say) interacting with my Echo.",Amazon
Negative,"Let me start by saying, I have been using computers since I was 5, and by now with some ease. I am no stranger to downloading music, I've been doing so since the Napster days.  Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. It's bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.  Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure ""oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me!"". Wrong. It's genuinely terrible.  Just today, I purchased 20 or so songs, but in order to retrieve them (oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS) I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history. So rather than 20 new songs, I now have 200+ duplicates plus my new songs. I feel violated by you Amazon. So does my hard drive space.",Amazon
Negative,"UPDATE: I now have the Galaxy S7. And guess what? This app is TERRIBLE. The ""update"" causes my playlists to stop after every song. It will not recognize my downloaded music library (4000 songs, and this app can't find ONE of them). And tech support is non-existent. I've reinstalled 3 times. I've uninstalled the update twice. I've refreshed about 10,000 times. Nothing helps. And I was stupid enough to upload my music to Amazon Cloud and build playlists from Prime Music. I think Mr. Bezos should refocus on his company rather than the Post or space junk.",Amazon
Negative,"this is the slowest app that I have experienced recently. It is slow to load, slow to update, slow to make changes (order of playlists). I can't believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle, Spotify, etc. The only advantage of this app is that it is cheap. But, functionally, it it terrible. I have been an Amazon customer an Prime member for 5 years, but I have to admit that their venture into the music world leaves a lot to be desired. Amazon, you can do better with the (almost) unlimited resources that you have. Spend some more time and money on this application and you could be the best, but if this is what you are willing to invest in this, users, please go elseware.",Amazon
Negative,"I used to LOVE Amazon's Music App, but with the recent change they eliminated a lot of features that I used and turned the app into something that is to me completely useless.  CONS  0) It's just slow, and laggy, and freezes all the time. While I'm uploading or it decides to download something (completely outside of my control) it can not be used.  EDIT***  Since the time of my originally posting this review amazon has introduced several updates that have incremementally begun to address my problem and I am so thankful for that. I had started using another music player but it is so much easier to have the program that i use to download my music also play it and it's great to see that a company as big as Amazon can listen to complaints and improve on products. I STILL want it to be a lot easier to remove music from my computer directly from the ap but they added the ""see file on computer"" option back again so if I really want to I guess I can use that. Thanks Amazon.  1) On the new app they have this extensive list/filtering system which is mostly redundant and yet so complicated I hardly ever know what subset of my music I am listening to. Is it my OFFLINE music, on the CLOUD, filtered by download date... or is it the ALBUMS section with ALL MUSIC, yet only purchased songs ordered by upload date? There is NOTHING smart about this set-up and it only serves to obscure the next point  2) I CAN'T STOP IT FROM DOWNLOADING EVERYTHING! I like to try out new albums/songs and support artists.. So I buy the album and keep it on the cloud and download my favorite songs for easy listening even without internet (yaknow if I wind up in the stone ages or something..) Maybe somewhere along the line I accidentally hit dl everything, although I don't believe that I did- but even so I can not find any setting that would be able to help me change that! furthermore they took away the ability to click on a song and find it on my computer which I could have potentially used to delete unwanted songs from my computer. AND NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO DELETE A SONG INSTEAD OF GIVING ME THE OPTION TO DELETE IT FROM THE COMPUTER OR THE CLOUD IT ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT THE CLOUD.  3) It's now more difficult than ever to donload or upload songs when I want to... having me drag and drop songs onto the words, upload or download is totally unintuitive especially since I usually like to deal in multiple songs.. which leads me to the INABILITY TO HIGHLIGHT MULTIPLE SONGS. That is a completely necessary/useful option that I don't understand the logic behind taking out.  4) When I click ""make a playlist"" from this song- nothing happens... I probably just do not understand what I was supposed to do maybe? But I am fairly computer literate and a programmer myself so if I can not understand it I assume that most are quite perplexed.  PROS  The color scheme is nicer... the icon looks good?  I originally was going to give this app a 2 star rating becuse I think the aesthetics really were an upgrade... but honestly there is such a downgrade in functionality this app is terrible now.. If there were any other way to easily download and listen to my music that I buy from Amazon I would be there right now..",Amazon
Negative,It is a terribly complicated way to upload and categorize music. If you upload your own music it uses the Artists name as the main indentifier and if there are multiple artists it creates an album for each of them instead of seeing the album as a whole. You can edit but the app is not user friendly in that it requires multiple steps each time you edit an album. Unlike iTunes you cannot edit the entire album information all at one time. It requires you to do that song by song. Terrible. I am not a fan of iTunes but I find it more user friendly then Amazon music.,Amazon
Negative,"Amazon needs to do some serious fixing on their digital media. I tried music for the first time after getting a prompt that im only using 2 services What happens with my first experience? ""Try again Later"" Yes thats what I wanted to see. Same applies to movies. Took two attempts and at least a half hour to get a movie to play. Last time I tried to watch a movie it was telling me I couldnt watch it in HD, ""not enough bandwidth"" I have 60 meg bandwidth router 10 ft from TV. Those services are terrible. Amazon. Renewal Im thinking not.",Amazon
Negative,"I can't give Negative stars, or else I would. There is no reason this product needs Android beyond 2.1. The best use for a old phone or device is to put it in a corner as a music player. But this requires that you be on the most current version of Android. Useless app.  It needs far too many permissions and is a data hog. I believe that is why they want the more current Android, in order to assure they are on my current device.",Amazon
Negative,It used to work great until the OS update. I hope they fix it soon. The update makes the app useless.,Amazon
Negative,"I love the Amazon Cloud service, and I store my entire music library on it. Unfortunately, my experience with it has been inconsistent and disappointing. I have an iPhone, and if I use the app on there for more than about 5 minutes, it locks up my phone, and it can take a full minute for it to respond. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and for some reason, Amazon decided to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre. That might not seem like a big deal for some people, but it's huge for me. Really makes the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to. I realize there are competition issues between Amazon and Apple, and Amazon and Google, but these inconsistencies and poor performance is a real let-down from Amazon.",Amazon
Negative,"Unlike others, I don't want to download all my music onto my phone. That would be impossible! I own a LOT of music, and when this app was Amazon MP3, I was easily convinced that I should upload all of my digital music to Amazon, and then I could play it wfrom my phone where ever I was (as long as I had a good internet connection, of course). Got a new phone, and I downloaded the new Amazon Music app. What it shows as 'Cloud' music is only about 1% of the music I store on Amazon's cloud servers. I can't really review any other feature of the app, because my music is not accessible. I called Amazon, and was told they were working on it. A couple of days later there was an update, which did not fix this problem. Amazon can add all the features it wants, but if I cannot play the music I already own, the app is useless to me.",Amazon
Negative,"Very difficult to maneuver, unlike Pandora. Also, unlike Pandora, there's no-one to speak to for help and Amazon's electronic help is useless!",Amazon

Negative,Useless and poor. Ask to pay another Prime suscription as it says that m'y account is not the same where it s working fine on PC.,Amazon
Negative,"2 stars. I love music. I had this app on an android phone and it had no SD support. Which made it useless since most android phones have what like 4 gb of internal storage. I've tried running this one a iphone. The app crashes all the time or loses its place and I have to start the app over again. No love there. So this is the big one. I have an Amazon Fire phone. yes, I'm one of the 5 people who bought one of these silly things. But to be honest its a pretty solid phone. So I was really shocked that you have to run this silly app to connect on their phone and not their built in music. On top of that the app stops playing all the time. There I am enjoying a song and all of sudden with no warning. Silence. I can push any button on the phone and the music starts again. Or if I'm lucky the music will start up again with no interaction (like its buffering and this isn't me streaming. I playing the music I ""downloaded""). I can understand the other two platforms not working all the time. I get it, its hard programing for other devices. But this is Amazons own phone! There is no logic in this place.",Amazon
Negative,"You have an internet connection. I downloaded a bunch of music but it won't play unless I have an internet connection, I wanted to be able to play my downloaded songs on road trips in between cell service but they won't play. Then there is the fact that you can only download songs to your phones memory and not an SD card, makes the 16 gigs of space I have available on my card pretty much useless",Amazon
Negative,"App looks great and seems intuitive. Why 3 stars? No option to move cached prime music (downloaded for offline listening) to external SD card. Instead the app fills up valuable space on your internal device storage with encrypted media files. I'm not sure why they do this. It can't be for copy protection since anyone can easily copy the cached music (m4a files). The files are encrypted and useless without playing them through the app as designed.  Other major problems: - no automatic volume normalization. Who wants to constantly turn the volume up and down with every song? - ""preview album"" function for listening to music I would potentially buy doesn't work reliably. I have to amazon.com through a browser and preview there. - Cannot read reviews of songs/albums. It shows how many stars and how many reviews, but does not take you to any reviews if you try to click on them",Amazon
Negative,"This issue with the app only playing music from a specific destination folder on the internal card is also creating another problem, playing music you didn't purchase from Amazon. If a sizable portion of your (large) music library isn't from Amazon, this app is worse than useless, it actually makes your music listening experience worse.",Amazon

Negative,"I have an Android tablet with OS 4.0.4...this is SUPPOSED to run on Android tablets running OS 2.0 or higher....NOT!!!! And as others have written, you can't download any of this music onto an SD card to put into your tablet or phone.

Personally, I don't like to tote a laptop around just to listen to music, and I have an awesome stereo in the house, so unless I can use this on my tablet, why bother???? So this is now a 100% useless service I am paying for.

Negative,"I have been using the Amazon Music App on my Tablet pretty much since it became available. I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet. This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App, this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.  However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had (meaning songs I didn't download from Amazon). I have my entire library on random so after the 20th track of very old music, I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists. I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device (why wouldn't they be?), yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I'm offline. Even albums I've purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app. I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members, (System of a Down, 311, Disturbed, etc), yet for some reason the app doesn't want to play them anymore unless I'm connected to the internet.  If I connect to the internet, then viola!! all my downloaded content plays. But think about this for a moment, what is the purpose of downloading for ""offline play"" if I can only play them when I'm online? I don't know what changed but an app that worked so well is now broken and pretty much useless for what I use it for. I'm not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the 8 - 10 hours I'm at work just because Amazon decided to break something.  This is incredibly ridiculous, and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull, and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library doesn't work. My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again, but I might not even bother because in 6 months it will probably break again.",Amazon
Negative,"I can't move it to my SD card. Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. It's pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it's a serious space hog and there just isn't enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can't be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I'll be more than happy to use it.",Amazon
Negative,"This app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that's bc it does SO MUCH! I wanna address 2 complaints I read abt 'no external SD support.' & that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist & that made the app a piece of crap. Okay, so 1st off, 500 songs is like 3 Days worth of music. I have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music. Does anyone's phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight?? if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot & prbly melt the phne. So, to me that's a useless comment & irrelevant. The other issue: I like that all the music us stored in the Cloud & it doesn't use ANY Storage space on my device. If u own the music u can download to ur device (it's fast!) to play offline if u ever get stuck or just don't want to use data. And, YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDERS 2 an external SD card if u have an Android (Samsung S5 user here). it works just like moving files on a computer. The hitch is this: u can download aNY of the music u want. However, u can only move the music you own. Amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: MP3 & MP4. It downloads in MP3 if u own it. Then u can move to an SD card & the app will find it & play it. MP4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage. Hopefully, most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this, so you can't transfer & steal music u haven't purchased. I personally think this is a great app & that Amazon Prime is better than sliced bread. I'm a true believer.",Amazon

Why do I need to waste time for this useless operation? Why does it not let me listen to the music while it is ""syncing...""? Why does it not sync in the background? Frankly, the more I use Amazon software the stronger is my belief that it is on par with Microsoft's in terms of confusing UI, marketing-first approach and ""beta"" quality.

There is an option (in the app) to clear the cache and this stops the player. But...why isn't there an option to close. Also (as others have mentioned) the songs are never actually downloaded. They stay in the cloud so you will use your data minutes every time you run it.,Amazon
Negative,"slow Not Responding poorly performing software... free with Prime, but poorly executed. Oh... and content no longer available ... kiss my assish. He's the guy that wrote the code...",Amazon
Negative,The music selection available with Prime music has been poor in the past but recently I have been very pleased with the selection and have actually had difficulties finding music they don't have. Prime music is definitely a great bonus to the Prime subscription.,Amazon
Negative,"I can understand how everyone want to make money off of things.  But the whole splintering of things, just gets to the point of being annoying. Go to Itunes for this, Amazon for that, who knows whoever is going to come with the next new service. Same for video, Warner Brothers apparently pulling videos from Netflix, to form their own service.  If they're going to ""DRM"" things, then there should be the equivalent of a DRM clearing house. If I ""buy"" an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I'm using online to listen to it. (Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?).  Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.  And of course speakers on phones suck.  So, Music?  I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another ""source"" of music.  I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service. And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface (downloading), it worked okay. But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.  I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.  So so so....  If you use it, more power to you.",Amazon
Negative,"The mobile app is pretty good. The site and the desktop app ui needs some work; very beta feeling. Also ran across some music that was encoded at poor quality. The download feature is really nice since I have a limited data plan and free with my prime membership is pretty cool. Looks like the business model is to give you just enough free music to get you to use it, but with holes in collections to get you to purchase more.  They do alow you to upload some of your music, but we still have yet to find the one app/service that will have everything. I currently use 5 now...",Amazon
Negative,I was dissapointed that the sound quality of the recording was extremely poor. This was probably associated with creating the mp3 recording. Amazon did refund the money but I would question if there is any quality control an if this problem will happen again. I will probably stick to cds.,Amazon
Negative,"Well, to make this fair... I love this app and prime music! I have had SAT radio for years, I accepted it for what it was. I don't have to any longer. My SAT radio always had a ""tin"" quality to the audio, but prime music is clear and amazing. I own a new F150 and have turned on the SAT only a few times. It's just as easy for my phone to automatically connect and start streaming. It sounds so much better. Choices, choices... Streaming stations, my library, or prime music that is usually available with my subscription! It's all there, in one place. You wouldn't think of writing a check for expensive, poor quality products, would you? So, stop feeding the SAT company. Prime is where it's at! Best of the best!!!",Amazon
Negative,Not enough music. Very poor competition to others like spotify for example.,Amazon
Negative,Just a few percentage of music content is available for prime subscribers. I was attracted by the price but very disappointed when find out that just a few track are included in the prime account. In addition the player is too poor in options compared to spotyfy or beats music players.,Amazon
Negative,"In addition to other bugs, I cannot remove this and now it keeps trying to update, but that fails. Amazon chose poorly when the hired the developers for this. Shameful.",Amazon
Negative,"Consistently restarts (20 times in one hour) which causes my phone to run slow. Can't set the app to run when you want it to, which is a poor design. A nice way to get the music you want, but until they fix the app it's uninstalled for now.",Amazon
Negative,Will not run on One Plus One CM11 - just crashes in an infinite loop. Any way you look at it - this is a very poorly written app. Maybe you should outsource to Google?,Amazon
Negative,It is hard to use with a poor selection I was not satisfied so far,Amazon
Negative,had issues with poor reception on LG phone. Now incompatible with Samsung phone...FRUSTRATION...Now Amazon account still reflects LG phone and won't update with new Samsung info...more FRUSTRATION... Now I can access music from cloud but only on pc ...then must transfer ... more frustration and irritation...,Amazon
Negative,"*** It should be noted that I wrote this review before Amazon converted this app to the ""cloud player"" so even though this app has the same name as the current one, there may be significant changes in how it works now. ***  You can search, listen to samples, and buy songs with this app. However, there are no user controllable settings and it gives VERY little information about the song or the album while shopping. You also must sync this to your amazon shopping account and enable one-click purchases to make it work.  This is a very basic app, which is a good thing to some degree... that's what keeps it simple. I'm glad it's not trying to be everything under one roof. I don't want it to be a music player and do all sorts of other annoying stuff like iTunes does. However, it is so limited that it's hard to feel like it's easy to use because the limitations require other work-arounds.  ~~~Shopping Experience:~~~  When shopping for songs or albums, there's no description, reviews, or anything else other than the artist, title, and a date (which is not explained--is that the release date or what?).  Being able to listen to song samples so easily is a very nice feature. It's quite easy to search for a song, quickly find it, and listen to a sample before buying. It's great if you're not sure what song you're looking for.  There are some strange things about it though. For example, several songs and albums I searched for have two versions of the same song for two different prices. Songs from the same name, artist, and album sometimes show up as two separate listings for $.99 and $.89 with no explanation of the difference. Are they different bit rates or something? Different formats? With no explanation available and no extra detail about the song... who knows what you're getting.  There seems to be no way to put songs in a cart and buy them all in a single purchase. You must activate one-click on your amazon account to use this app. I just started using it so I haven't seen the credit card bill yet, but the way this works makes it seem as though there's going to be a separate $.99 charge on the card for every individual song you buy. This seems a little tedious. I would love to buy several songs at once in a single transaction.  It would also be nice to buy up a credit balance for the phone like a gift card so I could just purchase songs as I discover them and have the cost deducted from my balance without paying for each separately. I don't want to have to share that with my other amazon web shopping however, so I'm not sure if a traditional Amazon gift card would work. It's all pretty poorly explained. If I were going to use this app a lot I would be tempted to create a new amazon account specifically for this app so I wouldn't have to commingle settings with my web shopping.  Also, there seems to be no way to retrieve previously-purchased songs later on if they get lost or deleted. It would be really nice if it would put the song in a queue to download next time you sign in from your computer so you can easily use it there too. Currently I copy them from my phone to the computer... so why not just buy them on the computer and copy them to the phone? That's not any harder or easier so it contributes to my point that while the app is easy in itself, it requires a bunch of extra work to get the full value out of your music purchase thereby negating the so-called convenience of the apps simplicity.  ~~~App Experience:~~~  Because there are no user controls, you can't specify what folder the songs get put into or where it is located. Neither of the music players on my phone are able to find the amazon mp3 folder on their own (even after refreshing the media list) and therefore are unable to show and play the new music. So I had to install a file manager app, and each time I buy a song I have to copy the it to my normal music folder.  Finally, the documentation for this app sucks. Actually working the app itself is pretty easy and self-explanatory (mostly because it has no features other than searching for songs and pressing the buy button), but it requires a whole bunch of coordination with your amazon account and its settings and the implications of all the little things you do are not at all evident. Everything is very poorly explained, if at all. You have to fumble through all the steps until you figure things out on your own. Then for the few topics they offer help with, it's takes you to a web page for an explanation... but comically, it's not a mobile-friendly web page so you have to zoom in and scroll left and right to read the lines. Seriously? These are web pages written specifically relating to a mobile phone app, ostensibly to be read primarily on a mobile phone, yet they're not in a mobile friendly format. Big fail.  ~~Summary:~~~  As powerful a site as amazon.com is, I'm a little surprised at how incredibly basic this app is. The way it works now, I find it much easier to just buy the songs from the amazon web site with a computer, and transfer them to the phone manually. The only time I envision using this app is when I'm away from my computer and desperately want a song right away.",Amazon
Negative,Very hard to work with. Does not let you download your music lists. the Amazon people are so nice but are no help at all. It is just a very poor music player,Amazon
Negative,"This is a poor music site !! Downloading music through the site can be confusing needs a lot of work for Prime members the overall selection you have access to for free is mediocre, this is a disappointment.",Amazon
Negative,"UI is very confusing and poorly laid out! Needs a drastic improvement. Song library is pale in comparison to the major apps... Pandora, slacker, spotify. Hopefull it will get better.",Amazon
Negative,I've enjoyed this app for a few years. That all stopped with the last update. Suddenly there are ads for amazon prime bs every time I go into the player. It's much slower and just a hassle to get around. Very poorly done amazon.,Amazon
Negative,Poor selection,Amazon
Negative,Too many major artists lacking. Poor foreign music offer.,Amazon
Negative,Poor sound quality.,Amazon
Negative,Poor selection and then what you do get is taken away.,Amazon
Negative,"I wish Amazon Music had the albums of some of favorite artists like Jessie or Yellowcard. I was very surprised to see that BeyoncŽ's Lemonade album was available on Amazon Music because the selection of many artists' albums is scarce. Sometimes it downloaded music won't play if you have a poor signal or don't have a signal at all -- very annoying. Other than those small things, it's a great music service that's free with my Prime membership so I can't complain too much.",Amazon

I can't see what's new and listen to previews of new music before purchasing, because nothing from this side of the globe is even on there! This needs to be fixed. No wonder so many people get their music for free via Torrents, when our choices to PURCHASE and control our own music libraries are piss poor. Greed in the streaming only game is pathetic, and you can only push people so far. FIX THIS BUG!",Amazon

Negative,App very poorly made... Stays on and appears spontaneously when not in use.,Amazon
Negative,Poor music service,Amazon
Negative,"I love Amazon music for certain music. Not at all for my Christian music. Not much of a selection. I love this one singer named Hilary Weeks but there is only one of her albums. I do like I can listen to all of Joey&Rory's music, Christian and county. Very poor when it comes to LDS singers.",Amazon
Negative,poor sound,Amazon
Negative,"Well, when looking for an alternative to Google Play, I thought for sure that Amazon would have their head on straight and would allow you to choose where the downloaded music is stored so that the memory limited main phone storage, which cannot hold my music collection, would not be crunched. Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well. There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application.",Amazon
Negative,"I wanted this app to be good since I'm a prime member. I could get over the clunky gui, but the app won't play more then one song off a playlist or album. This used to work fine but as updates have come it's gotten worse and worse. First it would only play five or six songs off a playlist/album. Now after the most recent update it will only play one then stop. The app will also crash every time I try to play a downloaded song. Really buggy and poorly written program. I expect much better from Amazon.",Amazon
Negative,"Using Android app on Samsung S4  TL:DR - App not recommended and will not use in its current state even when service is free. Buggy, prescriptive and not user friendly. Pity as the service itself seems quite good.  Pros : Simple install/setup - picks up amazon account by itself from your device if you already have another amazon app Managed playlists are nice, good varied selection Lots of good music in there  Cons : Automatically scans your device and inserts any other music it finds into the app's music library  - no way to disable this  - no way to exclude or remove songs located elsewhere on your device (it simply adds them back in when it scans again)  - no way to filter library so it only shows music you downloaded through Prime Music - it mixes it with anything it found during the device scan No way to specify download location - defaults to using internal storage instead of external SD card, limiting downloads severely. Stutters fairly frequently during playback of downloaded tracks. No way to perform a multi-select of artists/albums/tracks within the library - have to perform actions on each one individually (adding to playlist/remove from library etc).  more settings needed in the poorly populated 'Settings' screen such as :  - specify download location  - specify which folder(s) to scan for exiting music  - disable device scan",Amazon
Negative,"Most disappointed that Fire TV has no Amazon Music with Prime Music app yet. Also disappointed in this app on Android, it stalls A LOT and requires an app restart or reboot with reload. Streaming is MUCH better on the TuneIn Radio app on FireTV-Android-iOS from many different online radio stations all over the world. I tried Amazon Music with Prime Music also on Windows 7 and Mac OSX and found it to be inconsistent or get error messages even after installing the latest version of Adobe.  On the other hand, Amazon Music with Prime Music seems to work fine on iOS on an iPod.  Amazon adding their Amazon Music with Prime Music enticed me to finally get a Prime Membership of my own rather than use a family member's. However, while the Prime Video is awesome with lot of choice and solid streaming as are all of the Prime Video apps, I am rather disappointed in the Amazon Music poor streaming/buffering problems.",Amazon
Negative,"Crashes a LOT! App is slow, search is sluggish and inconsistent. I can search for an artist and it will return suggestions but no albums by that artist, but when searching for a similar artist the first shows up as a suggestion?! Sometimes searches return NO results but when I search again a few minutes later it finds results. The app sometimes switches between Cloud and Prime without warning. Music stutters too much compared to other players. I can stream HD in YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix just fine but I can't listen to a song from Amazon without it skipping. The selection is limited. Sound quality is poor. I hear a lot of the connotation artifacts, that under water sound.  At least it works okay enough to audition a few tracks before it crashes. It will help me make some purchasing decisions, though I doubt they will be made through this app.",Amazon
Negative,"I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.  First I will say a few Positives, the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think $7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.  Now the Cons - easy things to fix: 1. On the App, make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song, artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said, most other music apps are just as poor in this area - not a good excuse though. 2. The music recommendations for offline mode - I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full. So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it won't try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for, offline music.  Now the Cons - harder to fix, or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums, others are complaining as well: 3. Integration with Echo - When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day, Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse, it doesn't even shuffle on the command ""Echo Shuffle My Music"" or ""Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account"". On this command, echo starts with the same songs until I say ""shuffle"" again and skip a song. Then it says ""enabling shuffle mode"" and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is broken and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10,000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the $25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up. 4. Related to #3, when I do use the shuffle command, it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them, but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again, a month ago this was opposite, I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play, only Prime songs will shuffle, now it is reversed.  I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time. If this improves I will update my review.",Amazon
Negative,"Looks like Amazon is pushing people to Itunes with the latest iteration of Music.The prior app was relatively stable and offered music afficionados a reasonable interface for downloading their digital purchases. With the new ""blue"" release, I am back to downloading .ZIP files like it's 1999! This poor interface takes away the entire incentive of skipping cd purchases.  As a prime member who purchases both hard and digital media, I am no longer purchasing digital (unless it's dance music), instead I will go back to CDs and rip them myself.  Amazon, this iteration is complete crap. You can do better than this!",Amazon
Negative,"Just writing a review to give feedback. When I open the app to listen to offline music but have poor reception, it takes forever to load. If I turn off my internet connection, it loads instantly. Obviously there's a ""phone home"" check going on, and if you delayed that or did it in parallel, the app would perform much better!  Otherwise, it's an ok app. I count Amazon music as a nice bonus to prime - certainly not why I got prime, but nice to have anyway",Amazon
Negative,"Prior versions of this app were uninspired but functional. The current version is so poorly designed as to be nonfunctional. I've moved back to iTunes. Near as I can make out, the net effect of this app - if not the strategic intent - to make using this app to access downloaded and owned music so inconvenient that you just go to Amazon Unlimited streaming instead.",Amazon
Negative,"It's a waste of time out of the gate on my android phone. I bought a bluetooth headset to listen to podcasts while I'm mowing the lawn.  The podcast is already on my phone.  I open Amazon music, which is supposed to play music on the device and voila, it does. It plays through the speaker on the device.  I attach the headset and, uh, no. No audio. I can see it playing, I can hear the volume go up and down as it makes a ding each time I adjust the volume.  I screw around and waste 20 minutes pairing and unpairing, looking at settings, nothing fixes it so I toss it on the bed and mow my lawn with nothing but the voices in my head to occupy my time.  I come back in and install BlackPlayer. It works flawlessly out of the box.  Amazon how how much money to blow on development and you can't stream audio to a bluetooth headset in 2016?  Here's some advice. My data will never live in your cloud. Stop designing poor apps thinking it will.",Amazon
Negative,"CLUNKY! Yes, it does the trick, but sometimes I get confused as to where to look for things. Want to see albums by a certain artist? OK, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!  It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.  Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.  The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is).",Amazon
Negative,"this app needs work, especially if you use the Echo app with it, they get confused and sometimes the Amazon Music app will fail to work. The only fix I've found is to reboot the phone, simply killing the app and restarting doesn't work. This is on a Moto X running Android.",Amazon

Negative,"I've used this app for nearly 2 years and it's been great. I love my Amazon cloud drive and have most of my music uploaded to the cloud drive. Unfortunately, the recent update to this app is broken. If you are listening to music and then go use another app (chrome, facebook, a game, etc.) then the music will randomly stop playing at some point. So, this app is great if you are only going to listen to music and not use your device for any other apps. I'm back to using the system music player for now. My device is a Samsung Galaxy S3.  **UPDATE**  I tried to create a new review, which doesn't work. Still only 1 star, though, since I can't give the app Negative stars.  The new Amazon MP3 app is essentially unusable. You've never been able to set the download location to download music to the SD card but at least with the old Amazon MP3 app you could copy downloaded music to the SDCard. This is such a fundamentally flawed design choice that it really makes me question amazon's focus on what customer's want. However, now it's even worse with this new piece of crap app which 1) keeps defaulting to using Prime Music when you open the app (which sucks - I just want to play my music) but, 2) even worse, when you download music and copy it to the SDCard it won't see your music even if it's in the same folder. I've also found, when I did briefly use this new version of the app, that it crashed pretty regularly.  I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4.  Oh well. At least the Google Music app continues to just work. Can I give that app a 5-star review on Amazon? ;)",Amazon
Negative,"I love the Amazon Cloud service, and I store my entire music library on it. Unfortunately, my experience with it has been inconsistent and disappointing. I have an iPhone, and if I use the app on there for more than about 5 minutes, it locks up my phone, and it can take a full minute for it to respond. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and for some reason, Amazon decided to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre. That might not seem like a big deal for some people, but it's huge for me. Really makes the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to. I realize there are competition issues between Amazon and Apple, and Amazon and Google, but these inconsistencies and poor performance is a real let-down from Amazon.",Amazon
Negative,"I love the app when I am using it, but when I am not actively using the app it is still responsible for 25% of the battery drain. Samsung S7 edge up to date stock. Fix this unnecessary drain since my guess is the only thing it is doing during non-use is collecting data.",Amazon

I have an Amazon Fire phone. yes, I'm one of the 5 people who bought one of these silly things. But to be honest its a pretty solid phone.

There I am enjoying a song and all of sudden with no warning. Silence. I can push any button on the phone and the music starts again. Or if I'm lucky the music will start up again with no interaction (like its buffering and this isn't me streaming. I playing the music I ""downloaded"").

Negative,"I absolutely love the convenience of amazon music. The awful thing about streaming music is you normally have to pay an arm and a leg for the music you want and if you don't like to listen to the same stuff over and over it's not really worth it to me. The other streaming sites that are free you don't get to chose what you are listening to. Normally you get to pick a station and they chose what songs come on. With Amazon prime music you get to chose what you listed to. There are songs included with prime and some you have to pay for. The amount of songs that are included with prime is enough to listen to so buying a song here or there isn't a problem. Especially, when you make a prime purchase and chose no rush shipping you get a dollar credit for digital purchases. I LOVE IT.",Amazon

Negative,"As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon, its Prime Music's desktop version sucks. So much inferior to other widely-known streaming platforms. The design of its Android app is also stupid, in that I'm required to switch my phone's default language from Chinese to English to be able to use it.",Amazon
Negative,"Lots of material gaps. For example tears for fears was there, but the album sowing the seeds of love was. Other pay services have their entire catalog.",Amazon
Negative,Kind of clunky menu. Wishing it was easier to navigate. I guess I'm comparing to Pandora more than anything. Be more like Pandora Amazon Music! I love not having commercials though.,Amazon
Negative,Love it except for the part that it freezes when I listen to it in my car through Bluetooth. Can't be the Internet because Pandora plays smoothly. Other than that it's great.,Amazon
Negative,Dont yet love it. Pandora remains my go to. Prime has some great attributes but not to the extent of me using it exclusively (yet),Amazon
Negative,I love it. The only issue is when my phone goes on sleep mode or screen saver it shuts off the music. No clue how to fix that issue. Otherwise I love it;),Amazon
Negative,"Works really well, but I still stick with Spotify. The app is not as intuitive, and I just love the Spotify run feature",Amazon
Negative,"I like the wide range of choices available. When I listen to the same station a lot I tend to hear repeats, which is why I don't ""love it"".",Amazon
Negative,"Apple look out. I love this app and find no use for my iPod anymore why would I ? I still believe in buying CD's, I like to read the liner notes and have a tangible item, not just be forced to download it from iTunes. My whole iTunes library is all of my CD's apple iCloud won't let me back up my CD's only music I buy from them and I refuse to conform or be forced by Apple to do so it is so wrong and a big business mistake for them. I believe and support buying cd's not digital downloads.  Finally a very smart solution. A genius move on Amazon's part I downloaded this app, upgraded for $24.99 a year for 250,000 songs and another application that moved my music from iTunes in minutes. I have 3 - samsung note 3 and a galaxy 5, a kindle and a samsung tab it uploaded all my cd's from iTunes in minutes (I have comcast). I put my phone in a holster, in the car and play through the built in blue tooth or can just listen anywhere I go. Another thing Amazon does is when you buy a cd from them they automatically upload it. I am glad to see they are helping to keep music cd's alive and not just offer some digital download, all though they offer both digital and hard copies of cd's I think they are just so ahead of the game and if people were educated caught on, this would topple iPod sales. You don't even need to have one anymore this app makes it all seem like it was a big waste of money and the only game in town, now it collects dust in the drawer. My anger at iCloud not allowing my cd's drove me away. Don't get me wrong I work on a MAC but for music Amazon is the MAC DADDY.  Kudos to Amazon such a fine genius job. So sick of Apple and every time the computer crashed I lost all my cd's in iTunes because iCloud would not allow me to save my own cd's and had to start all over again. Amazon has is and always will be extremely advanced. Dropbox, iCloud have nothing on this app. It is clunky once and a while and slow but for the most part streams seamlessly. Also great on my Kindle HDX and all my other devices way to go Amazon !",Amazon
Negative,"I love to use this app on my Galaxy nexus, but it has a terrible problem of randomly stopping while playing music. I'm pretty sure it isn't some specific notification that stops the player, it's just random. Then you have to turn on your phone, unlock, and hit play manually to restart. Big problem, but otherwise great app.",Amazon
Negative,"The Amazon prime music is great, I love the amount of free music available and the ability to download to device. But wtf is the deal with not allowing downloaded data to be stored on external sd? Fills up device storage quickly! Amazon should be providing better service rather than trying to be like Apple.",Amazon
Negative,"This app is terrible. I love amazon. I love their music. I buy everything from them and have prime!!! I've bought music from Amazon since they sold only cds... But...this app just stinks. The sound isn't as good as other apps, it doesn't read my other playlists and it got corrupted somehow on my phone. After deleting it and reinstalling this app about 15 times, it finally worked as it used to.. Without my amazon prime music playlists. Badly done, Amazon. Please put some work and pride into your music app!!!",Amazon
Negative,Free music included with Prime is awesome! Only down side is that there is no live radio. Would love to get rid of my Sirius / XM and just use Prime Music.,Amazon
Negative,Love the fact that all my music is easy to find and play through this app as well as the equalizer feature. Sadly at some point after updating it stopped recognizing my phone. I would also like an exit button as it seems to stay on perpetually even after I've stopped the music.and drains my battery faster. Plays well,Amazon
Negative,"I love it but it's just too bad you can only use it on one device at a time. Seriously, how many people are going to have two Prime accounts if they are living with each other?",Amazon
Negative,Love it most of the time....until I try to SYNC it in my car ....cars & music go together right? Unfortunately a hassle.,Amazon
Negative,"The idea is great but it's not functional. I tried to stream a song by Mercy Me for a camp service in July & it kept stopping and never once got through the entire song. I really want to love it & replace our slacker account but so far it's not an option :(",Amazon
Negative,I love but an update on windows 10 caused it to stop working on my laptop?????,Amazon
Negative,There are some songs or cds that I can't find on here that I wish I could but otherwise I love the app,Amazon
Negative,I love the music but unfortunately IT does go off now and then.,Amazon
Positive,"Amazon Music is great , I don't know why I didn't get it sooner. love it.",Amazon
Positive,"Love that you can download music as a Amazon Prime Member. Just was a little confusing for me when it asked certain questions on where to store songs and also if there was a charge for the songs. That is the only reason I did 4 stars. I am not quite as tech savy as some of the younger people, so just would have liked a little more explanation. Love having the music though.",Amazon
Positive,"This has been a great benefit of being a prime member. Its has almost infinite playlists and music geared towards everyone and everything. I love the thumb up thumbs down options that allow you to make your preferences known, plus the ability to download whole albums or just single songs. It brings up new artists you might like and has stations for whole genres or just specific artists that also play their musical colleagues. Great product or service from amazon. AGAIN!",Amazon
Positive,"I am really impress with the Amazon Music, I love it. HUGE selection of all kind if music of all gender. The Best Music player!! I know what I'm talking because I am a Broadcaster and DJ's.",Amazon

Positive,I can listen anywhere to the music I've already selected. Love this!!!,Amazon
Positive,AMAZON MUSIC is so easy and is much better than ITUNES in many ways. The only downfall is that my CHRISTIAN artists do not do as much with Amazon Music and other than that...I downgraded my ITUNES account and am doing Amazon now. We are going to buy the Echo Dot and love the whole Alexa thing...better than Siri!,Amazon

Positive,Love site,Amazon
Positive,"I started out by taking advantage of the prime 30 day free trial. I wasn't sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I don't have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movies. I don't have a gaming device. Then as I was learning more about prime music. The rest is history, I am now a prime member. Maybe before my membership runs out I will have some kind of device to view thru my TV. Thanks again. Love Amazon and Prime Amazon. Keep up the good work",Amazon
Positive,My go to when I drive. I love the music selection. I was also happily surprised when I got a message last week that the new Bob Dylan was out. I promptly downloaded it. I truly dig the stations and suggested music.,Amazon
Positive,love it,Amazon
Positive,Love it!!!! Move over pandora,Amazon
Positive,Love this app! Tons of music. Easy to navigate around. 5 stars!,Amazon
Positive,"I love Amazon Prime and now they have added Prime Music, I like it for the most part - there are a lot of popular songs and some new songs that I get to listen for Free. I took one star away because, like I said before - - it's only POPULAR music. I live in Hawaii and I love it when streaming sites let me listen to my own local music. Granted they have like old Hawaiian Slack Key music, but I'm more interested in local Jawaiian music that plays locally over the radio.",Amazon
Positive,A great app to use on my android phone and tablet! I love that I can upload my personal library to it and listen to it when I'm on other devices then my computer.,Amazon
Positive,I love this app. I am still learning and navigating my way through but it is the only music app I use now! It has a lot to offer!,Amazon
Positive,I just love Amazon Music w/ Prime Music. Can't wait to see what the future holds.,Amazon
Positive,Love it!!,Amazon
Positive,"I use this all the time. I have the app on my phone so I can take it with me every where I go. I have found sooo much music from ""back in the day"" that I thought I'd never hear again. It's much better than listening to the radio...no commercials! It made all my other music apps obsolete...just plain love it!",Amazon
Positive,"I love being able to stream music free on my phone with the app. This is a great perk for amazon prime members!  We stream at home and hook my phone to a cord that runs through the stereo and surround speakers so I can listen while cooking. I also do this in the car.  I love all the chanel's offered.",Amazon
Positive,"Gotta love the music! Kinda sad that songs I consider my favorites, that really shouldn't be rare or hard to find, are amiss from this app... oh well, the pros must definitely outweigh the cons.",Amazon
Positive,I LOVE Amazon Prime Music! It is a great benefit to have included in my Amazon Prime membership. That is one of the main reasons I got my membership. I like being able to listen to the music I have picked on my phone via bluetooth in my car. I can switch it to the Offline Library so it does not charge me data to listen to my music. I would not be without it!,Amazon
Positive,I love being able to create my own playlists.,Amazon
Positive,I love amazon Prime Music. The only reason why I give it four stars is because I can't access it on my other devices and also not with our Fire TV device.,Amazon
Positive,I love it!,Amazon
Positive,Love this app. It has so many features.,Amazon
Positive,Love the selection of music. Amazon Music is my best friend. It's with me where ever I go.,Amazon
Positive,"Love it! No problems with the app, & always easy to find my tunes.",Amazon
Positive,I love my music on my phone while work outside.,Amazon
Positive,I absolutely love the large variety of music but my concern is that the app runs all the time. Even if I force close the app down it randomly start running without opening it,Amazon
Positive,Love using this app with my prime membership. Amazon has the best play lists and stations and my music sounds so much better with this app than others.,Amazon
Positive,Love the free music on my pc. Even got it to stream to my Ouya to listen on the surround sound in the living room,Amazon
Positive,Love it. What a wonderful app to have with prime membership. Definitely worth it and makes listening to music and skipping as easy as a button click. Would recommend over other music apps due to music selection and simplicity of usage.,Amazon
Positive,"I love this! I listened to Pandora for a long long time. Then I found out that this was a benefit of having an Amazon Prime account. So I went through and added a whole bunch of songs. I found it easiest to look up a song, then go to a playlist it was in, and then add songs like a crazy person from there LOL I now have a very large library and often open up Amazon music and hit Shuffle and go about doing my chores, or cleaning up around the house. Certainly makes it more enjoyable! And it's nice to have ALL songs that I like. And with most of them, I've been able to add to my playlist for free. You can even download for offline play. Not every song is on here but I have only found one that I really wanted that wasn't. And I purchased it for 99 cents. I love this app/ bonus feature of Amazon Prime",Amazon
Positive,I absolutely love Amazon Prime and Amazon music and Amazon shopping and anything Amazon... Keep it up Amazon!,Amazon
Positive,"Amazon Music with Prime Music All kinds of music are passions of mine. I am a Prime Amazon member but have to say; next to the two-day shipping that Prime members receive, this is the second best feature offered. I have the app on my phone, my Kindle, and my computers. They ALL work great and I have not had any problems at all with them. The app has ""stations"" that I absolutely love because they are already put together playlists that actually go well together. I can make my own playlists with east on all devices. You can separate each song by album, singer, or genre. The platform is the same on each device which is great - no further learning on each device. I have over 6,000 songs on my app and have used MANY other similar apps from other companies. They do not come close to this easy to use great app.",Amazon
Positive,"As a Prime member, this app is pretty much an essential on my phone and Kindle Fire. I love creating playlists and have found a lot of great music to listen to for free. I would recommend this over Pandora (my previous favorite) any day! I wish that it would recommend music as I love to discover new artists but so far I've made it work by cross referencing a certain song with what others have added in playlists containing it.",Amazon
Positive,"I love having this ap to listen to full albums! It's a pain if it won't load sometimes, but a lot of that is just Internet connection.",Amazon
Positive,OMG!!! The BEST thing I ever got! I LOVE being able to get the old music I grew up on and the new artists I discover. I have recommended this to everyone I know. The cost of Amazon Prime with all that I get for the dollars is the best money I spend every year. This music just makes it better. I NEVER have trouble playing the music and being able to download music and have it in the cloud so I can hear it anywhere makes this the best music source I have used.,Amazon
Positive,Love and use it,Amazon
Positive,"I love music and this is the best I have found. I can't think of any song or artist that I haven't been able to find. Rock, r&b,pop,easy listening rock /opera,metal. It is awesome it,s not like the generic music apps. this ""thing"" has so many options and no commercials. it really does listen to me and follows my lead. cool",Amazon
Positive,"Don't care about the nay sayers. Prime is great, so oo many songs, playlists and genres of music to choose from. I also use Pandora. I pnow prefer Prime over pandora because I can play my music offline. There are a lot of music apps out there. They all have things you will love or hate. Give them a try, especially the ones with free trials. Simply pick the one that works best for you.",Amazon
Positive,"I listen to a wide variety of music. Amazon has a lot. I absolutely love the fact that it's commercial free. I am overall happy with it. Unlike Slacker and iheart where you are limited in use Amazon music gives you the freedom to enjoy what you want to hear.",Amazon
Positive,Love Amazon music. If you have prime there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't have this app and shouldn't be using. This works fantastic with Alexa and has a great selection of music.,Amazon
Positive,I love this addition and listen almost daily. Variety is marvelous!,Amazon
Positive,"Who can't love this app? I use it more than any other streaming apps. Skip songs as many times as you like with no restrictions. Download songs to device, save it to the cloud or just play from Amazon to see if you like it. I can't say enough about this app. It's great!! Sign up for prime and you'll be loving it too!!",Amazon
Positive,"Love it!!! Excellent music selection from every conceivable genre and no commercials!!! My only minor issue is that two family members cannot stream prime music from the cloud at the same time. However, you can still listen to downloaded music/playlists while another streams from the cloud. Amazing benefit of the Prime Membership.",Amazon
Positive,Great music. Love listening to it while at work and driving. love this app.,Amazon
Positive,I love it..canceled my Sirrius radio subscription. All of the music stations i listened to have an equivalent station on here included woth my Prime membership.. I have been with Sirrius radio since the start up... the app works great too on my Samgung S7.,Amazon
Positive,"absolutely amazing. Leave it to Amazon to come up with such a great service for Prime members. I admit I have an eclectic love of all types of music. I love all types and when I go to look for it , sure enough it's there. Thank you Amazon for Amazon Music as it has become a favorite",Amazon

Positive,"Love buying a single song, accessing from any device, and getting my worship on!",Amazon
Positive,"Finally I've foud a space to store and share my choice in music. I like having the player on my computer and my phone. Now trying to figure out about storing in the cloud and playing while streaming--or should I download the song?  I'm still learning but love this app. I have Amazon Prime, and they share lots of the music I like for free.  Definitely my most favorite music playing app.",Amazon
Positive,"I really love this music app. I like that I can search and find almost any song. I hate using the Pandora and other apps because you have to wait forever to hear the song you really want to hear.  The app does seem to force close every couple of days. Most of the time it works flawlessly. Another benefit of using prime.",Amazon
Positive,I love the mixed music selections they offer its almost like iTunes Match only better. They already know what albums I'm going to like and suggest them so that I can add them to my play list. Best of all I don't have to pay any extra money it's already included with my Prime Membership. I don't even use iTunes or beats what ever they are calling themselves these days,Amazon
Positive,"It's one of the best features of Prime. The variety of music that comes as a part of the Prime Music subscription is fantastic. Not everything I want is free, but I haven't found anything yet that cannot be purchased. I listen to it all day at work, when I can, and then crank it up at home on weekends. I love Prime Music.",Amazon
Positive,I've been using the Amazon music app for my Samsung Note 4 for about a year now. I love that there are no commercials. Choosing the prime music to listen to its easy and there are so many choices! The prime stations have a good variety of music that the station selects for me to listen. I use it almost every day!,Amazon
Positive,Love this. I can listen to music while I study without all the annoying adds.,Amazon
Positive,"Having my favorite music with me is vital to my enjoyment of the day. It's easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes (in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety (even though it is already large) in this genre. another problem I have (which is really more to do with Apple) with it is that it can't play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it.",Amazon
Positive,I love how easy it is to create your own playlists and then have them played back on the echo dot!,Amazon
Positive,It's awesome love it especially Amazon music unlimited!!,Amazon
Positive,I use this app a lot. Love the pre-made Playlist feature. Works well for long trips,Amazon
Positive,Seriously I love how I have music free now that I've bought prime. Ty for making such a perfect deal,Amazon
Positive,"I was seriously impressed with the range and variety of music available. When I read amazon was going to raise the prime cost I thought about dropping the service, the addition of the music has made me reconsider. There are so many benefits to prime now I will probably renew in October. Did you know prime delivered, for free, a college textbook on Sunday via overnight service, that my daughter needed on Monday. I liked prime for the price. Now I love it thanks to the music.",Amazon
Positive,"Love, love, love my Amazon music. I listen to it at work, at the gym or at home while working around the house. It is worth the Amazon Prime membership for all the awesome perks you get with the membership! Wish I had signed on sooner.",Amazon
Positive,I love my Prime Music. The song choices are all that and more. The stations work much like iHeart with the bonus that you can go back to songs already played. There are so many prime free albums you can download to your offline library and sharing between devices is really easy. I use my app several times a week with no issues.,Amazon
Positive,"Use it all the time, I love the unlimited skips and no commercials. I find living here on Kauai where cell reception is spotty the fact that the app caches some of the data that's being played I experience no skips in the music that is being played even while dipping in and out of service. Keep up the good job Amazon!",Amazon
Positive,Love this app. Let's me listen to whatever I want and recommends songs I actually like.,Amazon
Positive,"I love you can get albums downloaded to prime account and then I can listen to music when I'm on my Kindle for free! I wish they had more of the albums that I liked on prime, but it's great!",Amazon
Positive,I love Amazon music. I can access so many albums and soundtracks without feeling obligated to buy anything. I don't use the radio function much but it works fine. This essentially feels like spotify without having to pay for a separate service as I already pay for amazon prime to begin with.,Amazon
Positive,"I love the Amazon Music app! I thoroughly enjoy all the music that is right at my fingertips whenever I want. Makes time spent in the car much more tolerable, chills me out in the evening, etc. Now I can't imagine being without it.",Amazon
Positive,Love that it includes some free music with prime. I would rather listen and then buy.,Amazon
Positive,"I LOVE AMAZON MP3 PRODUCT .  I Download mp3's from Amazon. This is a free product to download to help store my music & retreive it later for use on other computers or devices like my Android phone. I can even transfer my music from my cloud player to my device. I can't compare it to other similar products, because this is my first product I use to download & store my music. I am a beginner, but it's easy to use. I have lost music on my computer, but i was able to log on to amazon site, sign in & reteive music from past & future purchases. I plan to continue using this product. THANKS AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Amazon

Positive,"I love that it has lots of music. There are a few songs that I wanted and couldn't find. However, I was able to upload them from the Itunes store.

Positive,Love it.,Amazon
Positive,"When I purchased amazon prime I wondered if it would be worth $99 a year, but since it was our goto source for so many of our everyday purchases I thought we would give it a try. Once I discovered prime instant videos, I dropped netflix, which made the purchase of amazon prime, a wash. Then my son in law introduced me to prime music which will enable me to drop my subsription to Pandora. I love Amazon!!!",Amazon
Positive,"If you are a Prime member and enjoy music, you'll want to check out all the FREE Prime Music offerings, but you'll need this app to be able to have all the selections play accurately and to enable you to download selections to your devices.  I love the Amazon Music with Prime Music application as it makes it easy to see your music at a glance; either by artist, album or playlist. You can also use the Search in the app to find other Prime Music you may have missed and easily add it to your Library.  This app upgrades your paid music too, so you never lose anything you may have already purchased on Amazon. If you have the Amazon Cloud Player, this Amazon Music with Prime Music is essentially an upgrade to that player with the focus on Prime offerings.",Amazon

Positive,"The service is fantastic. I really love the music selection and the ability to play what I want, when I want. The mobile app can be a bit flaky from time-to-time, but that could be due more to my phone than the app itself. This has replaced Pandora on all of my devices.",Amazon
Positive,"I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings. It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number.",Amazon
Positive,How do I love the.... there isn't enough room to count the ways! Your given the opportunity to like or dislike selections and music is played to your desires. Could it get any better..... don't think so! Thank you Amazon!,Amazon
Positive,I love the variety of music that is available!,Amazon
Positive,Love It! Easy to use and completes my set of Amazon apps...,Amazon
Positive,love having my music collection available to stream or download pretty much anywhere,Amazon
Positive,"I love all the FREE songs I've listened to. I need a way to separate my son's songs from mine on the cloud though! Since I let him use it, I now scroll through HUNDREDS of songs that aren't mine. I also wish I could figure out how NOT to accidentally download 2 albums by same group, found out one is ""clean"" other isn't. Had to vet out the ones I doubled. But, it's still well worth it. So, I'm not sure why my son keeps pressing for spotify?",Amazon
Positive,"Needs to be updated to android 4.4 capability, where you can have library on your SD card instead of system memory. This feature has been available on other apps, including Google play music, since December 2013.  That being said I love amazon prime music! I love accessing my library from my kindle, my PC, my phone, or my fire TV stick.",Amazon
Positive,"I am not a first-mover when it comes to technology, so my love of this might be tempered with a sense of time. Some of you might say well, duh! about the cloud player, but having a free digital copy of most of the CD purchases I make from Amazon is too cool. I can listen to those songs on my phone from the cloud player. Wow. Finally a forward-thinking customer service tool that rewards me for my continued patronage. I now buy almost everything on Amazon, not just music.",Amazon
Positive,"I love this app. Although there are songs or artists unavailable for free download, I find the plusses to outright the Negative. It has a built-in sleep timer! It will stay on up to 60 minutes while you are falling asleep then will turn itself off. I love this feature!",Amazon
Positive,"We use this app all the time. Absolutley love it and love the fact that it is airplay compatible. Never have had any issues and the county, pop and top 40 stations are free, no commercials and play great music",Amazon
Positive,It's the only way I listen to music now; love it.,Amazon
Positive,This is exactly what I was looking for! Music at my fingertips that doesn't need to be clogging up my software. Another great thing I love with Amazon Prime :),Amazon
Positive,"I LOVE Amazon Prime Music!! It's one of the biggest perks (outside of the 2-day shipping) that my Prime membership affords me. I listen to it all the time at work, in my car, and at home. Love, love, love it.",Amazon
Positive,"Well damn. I've had prime for 5 months now. Just used it for the free shipping because I'm revamping my furnishings, but I tried prime music and it had all of the songs I love available to me with wifi which is 16 hrs a day, so yay!",Amazon
Positive,Love it! Music selections is unlimited,Amazon
Positive,Love how most songs are available and all the lyrics are there! Can't wait for it to improve to being better than Spotify so I can cancel my premium subscription. Almost there though! Not as many songs yet,Amazon
Positive,"Love, Love, Love Amazon.Prime Music! Bluetooth is great in my van! Hooks up quickly and I'm singing along before the van moves! So many choices! I wish I had subscribed to this before I subscribed to SiriusXM! At least now I know so won't need to renew SiriusXM! Thank you Amazon!",Amazon
Positive,love this app.//,Amazon
Positive,Love it!! No ads,Amazon
Positive,"This app has had a few iterations and I appreciate the complexity of adapting a program like this in an agile fashion, But, routinely there are changes that are not thought-through and the constant changes in functionality, removal of some functionality and lack of comprehensive design principles can be very, very frustrating. My latest gripe is the ""download playlist"" button that loads a second after the button right next to it, which is ""shuffle playlist."" Several times now I've gone to push the ""shuffle playlist"" button and then the ""download playlist"" button loads into it's place. Now my phone is slowed down in attempts to download the playlist. When all I wanted to do was listen to the playlist! Rrrrrr. Sometimes I wonder if anyone at Amazon actually uses the product. I do, everyday, and I would love to help (re)design it. Just a bit more attention to design principles is all I ask.",Amazon
Positive,"I love it!!!!! There isn't every artist in here, but it is great that it can come with the full album of the artists that are in here.",Amazon
Positive,I love this app!! I can listen to music anywhere I want and I can also use my credits from purchases to buy songs that I really like! I would highly recommend this app to everyone!!,Amazon
Positive,I love my I pod and this site helps me keep my music New and fresh.,Amazon
Positive,"I use thi sapp on my phone and I love it! It comes free with my Prime membership, and that makes it even better!!",Amazon
Positive,"Amazon music is great, love that I can download music to my device and then listen without internet (like on an airplane). The app for my phone does freak out a little though because it doesn't have an internet connection at first, but it settles down and gets on to playing music. I wish it had more available music though.",Amazon
Positive,I downloaded this Android app onto my BlackBerry Z30 from the Amazon App Store. The app did run but it was very sluggish. I ended up uninstalling it for this reason and also because the song selection available for Prime Streaming was not huge. I do like the idea of this though as I am currently a Spotify customer and would love to see the song selection expanded. I will keep an eye on this service to see if it gets better.,Amazon
Positive,"Intuitive, with a wide array of music I love. This gives me the chance to listen to songs I haven't heard in years by artists who had sadly slipped my mind. I love it. What else is there to say?",Amazon
Positive,"Love everything about amazon and prime except that i can't use my sd card for data, and thus can't use the app much. Stinks to have 50 gigs of space but not be able to download 1 song. Amazon please fix this!",Amazon

Positive,I love listening to music and Amazon Music has a variety I like.,Amazon
Positive,"I use this app both on my EVO phone and my Motorola Xoom tablet and it always works great. I love not having to transfer my songs from the phone to the tablet or viceversa. I connect my phone to my car radio and listen to music as I drive. The only problem I have is that when I get a phone call, the music keeps playing and I have to stop it manually. But still love it.",Amazon
Positive,Love the choices and prices! The variety is pretty good! And if you are a Prime Member better!,Amazon
Positive,"I love this service. They don't have every song I want to listen to, but they have most and they certainly have a library that is extensive enough to make great playlists. My son and I use the service all the time to listen to music in the car. There are no commercials, you can skip as much as you want and listen to your playlists in the order you choose. This is perfect for me and I am thrilled that Amazon offers this service as part of my Prime membership.",Amazon
Positive,I absolutely love this app! The music selection is great the offline experience is really good it's just a wonderful app,Amazon
Positive,"Love the app when it works, as it freezes playing my prime music, and says it has downloaded music when it has not, which are a skosh disturbing.",Amazon
Positive,"Love prime music there's not a album I can't find, and creating your own list is really nice!",Amazon
Positive,"Awesome, I love the fact that Amazon includes this streaming music service with my Amazon Prime membership! I don't order that many items on Amazon, so was having a hard time justifying the $99/year annual membership fee. Now that they include music and movies/TV and cloud storage with my membership, I think I'll continue subscribing!",Amazon

Positive,Once I learn more about using it I am sure 4 stars will become 5. I am nearly 66 and I have loved music all my life. I love having Bruno Mars and so many other artists available at the touch of my fingers to sing to me. Also great for dancing with the grandbabies.,Amazon

Positive,"I love the vast musical library I now have at my finger tips. Perfect for any mood, anywhere. =]",Amazon

Positive,Love it it's amazing!!!! Wish I didn't need 4G tho.... Still great :)),Amazon
Positive,"I love all of the free music. My wife has accidentally used large amount of data playing music from Amazon when she thought it was downloaded to her phone,when it was really only added to her cloud. I would like for the app to make this a little more clear.",Amazon
Positive,"I love this app! The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps. I would however suggest that the equalizer be made accessible right from player itself instead of one searching deep within the settings. That aside, it's one of the best music apps and I recommend it for every good music lover out there.",Amazon
Positive,This is amazing. I love being able to download my music so i can listen to it at our lake cottage where there's no wifi. I also enjoy the variety of stations from Christian to Pop to Jazz. Worth every penny for Prime.,Amazon
Positive,"I hadn't listened to online music until I got an email reminding me about my Prime account benefits. Wow I've been missing out! I love it! 5 stars!!",Amazon
Positive,"Didn't even realize this came free with our prime membership, what a great resource. Love that there's no ads, unlimited skipping, and can rate things so it picks out better songs. My only hope? That T-Mobile will add it to their unlimited music streaming services",Amazon
Positive,"I'm soon in love with Amazon Music -sung in my Beyonce voice! This music app is the best thing that could ever happen to my phone, song after song , hit after hit. I feel like I have a mini Soul Train with me due to the variety of music from funk to slow jams!",Amazon

Positive,I love prime music because I can select all my favorite artists and songs into the library which can play the whole day. It is better than Pandora because there is no Ads. I think everyone should have it.,Amazon
Positive,Love this! I listen to music everyday from this!,Amazon

Positive,Love your music selection,Amazon
Positive,"I had forgotten this was included in Prime membership. I love it. Really enjoying the playlists and all of the recommendations for me are relevant and I do love them!

Positive,"Well, to make this fair... I love this app and prime music! I have had SAT radio for years, I accepted it for what it was. I don't have to any longer. My SAT radio always had a ""tin"" quality to the audio, but prime music is clear and amazing. I own a new F150 and have turned on the SAT only a few times. It's just as easy for my phone to automatically connect and start streaming. It sounds so much better. Choices, choices... Streaming stations, my library, or prime music that is usually available with my subscription! It's all there, in one place. You wouldn't think of writing a check for expensive, poor quality products, would you? So, stop feeding the SAT company. Prime is where it's at! Best of the best!!!",Amazon

Positive,"Installing Cloud Player and amazon MP3 player was my first excursion into putting music on my smart phone, which I, not being a digital native, was apprehensive of attempting; however, I could not resist the idea of getting something for nothing...so I timidly proceeded.

I started the free trial thinking I would just give it a shot and wound up telling Amazon to definitely just charge me and continue the membership within hours! I cancelled other services that provided similat things and went from spending about $30 per month to just th $100 a year. The mobile music app is the best one I've ever had.

I live in rural northern Minnesota free 2 day, yup and thanks for every other feature. Please dont raise the price again though, I'm still poor :( but the music app is really clean, and does everything pandora does and more. Plus nothing better than test driving a new album, I still usually buy the ones I like. Good art deserves to get paid. Except the drummer from Metallica, I don't even download music and I hate him. Let the new guys bitch, you had 30 years prior to make a living.",Amazon
Positive,"I like it a lot! Has a lot of popular music (I mostly listen to country music so that's what this is based on) and even songs that weren't popular, but that I like.

Positive,I absolutely LOVE it. Any song I want right at my fingertips.,Amazon
Negative,It's really good.. but a pain to use. And it adds song to my play list that I didn't pick.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Spotify is my main source of music. It is available on every device including Roku, and has the ability to put together play lists. I used to download mp3s and it took hours of my life transferring them onto devices or cds. I had to pick one track out of entire albums constantly, and it was a pain. I am an early adopter of Spotify and the Internet in general. I remember when Yahoo Music came out. I was there for the controversial Napster, and the embracing of mp3 as a legal format to sell albums on iTunes.  Spotify could stand to give a bit more back to artists, but I love I pay a monthly fee and can support musicians just by listening as usual. I love it has a high quality play back mode and an offline mode for when you lose service. I still think it's important to purchase music, but as a culture streaming will be vital to the new model being built in the music industry.  Spotify links to last.fm accounts for charting your music, you can add local files to it, and it has great Playlist choices, recommendations from friends, stations, and more. If you're a music lover you will love this app as you have much more control over what you listen to, and is great at helping you discover new music! While supporting artists.  I highly recommend to anyone who doesn't already have Spotify. It's my daily driver, my go to, my happy place. I've been using it since it came out and I am ever grateful for it in my life. I just upgraded to a family plan so everyone can enjoy and make their own play lists.  I'd also like to add the app is smart. If you have it running at home the use it on your device it will switch to the new device seamlessly. Pretty cool right?  I think so!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"It's A Great And Wonderfully Helpful App, But I Wish It Had Way More Songs. Like, The Gypsy Bard? The One About Pinkie Pie??? Please Add It. I NEED YOU TOO__!!! And If/When You Add The Song I Will Rate You Five Stars__! Also, Please Make It So That I Can Mute A YouTube Video And Listen To Music With It! Like With The Speedpaint Videos I Like To Watch! Sorry For The Long Review, Toodles!",Spotify(3)
Negative,what a pain but good music selection,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Sorry cannot comment on this app as it will not let me register, I presume it is because I live in Spain but have a UK email address and it doesn't seem to like this.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Spotify is a fantastic service with great music content. I have used it for about 2-3 years now and recently i have upgraded to premium to take away the ads (which are always funny and interesting) the only problem i have ever had with it is sometimes if you have your library saved offline to your phone it will un install all the songs forcing you to redownload them. Now this may only be a bug, and it has only happened to me twice in the past 6 months but it is kind of a pain. If they patch that bug then i will gladly give a 5 start review.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I am enjoying the free version of Spotify and considering the premium version. If I could express one concern/issue, it is the fact that every time an ad comes on the volume is dramatically increased....literally to the point where it is painful. I understand the need to have ads for the free version, and I'd be OK with a slight increase in the volume, but what I experience for a volume increase with each ad is far beyond what is required or what reasonable customers should be asked to tolerate. Any chance you can throttle it back into the reasonable range?",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Great variety of music, love that you can save songs and make playlists. Only Negative so far is that the ads are significantly louder than the music at least 2/3 of the time, painfully so especially if you have on headphones.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Sad, worked twice then got all crunchy with audio, barely hear any voices from podcast. So frustrating; and, yes, tried on multiple devices with same result. Painful.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Spotify + Amazon Echo = frictionless musical bliss. Spotify is by far the best interface for curation and discovery. Alexa helps you enjoy all your playlists and stations without being tethered to a phone or tablet. Especially great for moms, people who paint/cook/clean/build, and for anyone who has always wanted a personal DJ.",Spotify(3)
Negative,love it. can find any type of music and when you play a certain type it will set you up with like type programs for each day. the 30 second commerical - every 30 minutes is not painful at all.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Great to listen to Music, but it is a pain to deal with is you are not subscribed. Also, if you do the three months for .99 that comes around every once in a while and do not want to fully subscribe, make sure to cancel the subscription the day before it is going to expire",Spotify(3)
Negative,I have an spotify premium account on my galaxy when I to download the app on my Fire HD 8 it asks me to check my billing address and payment are from a supported country (I live in Spain). What should I (or spotify or amazon) do?,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Don't waste your money on the Premium!!! Had it for almost a year... - could NEVER get ""My Songs"" to play correctly (using 2 different laptops and three different Android phones in that time). Some would play, wome would just not and whenever they would come up it would stop the entire shuffle....and then they would play the next time through.... - Making play lists and saving things for Offline use is a pain in the ass!! - The ""artists like this"" or ""songs like this"" function is no better than Pandora (and I've never paid for that premium service""  I went to Spotify because Itunes is a pain....but honestly it's no worse...plus had I stayed there, I would actually OWN all the songs I've found on Spotify in the last year!",Spotify(3)
Negative,Spotify has carried me through so many tough days and nights. As a person with chronic pain music saves my life. I do miss the lyrics feature though.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Suffers in comparison to Apple music, especially pricing. Commercials on the free app are painful. Not impressed with search algorithm. Curated playlists are kinda meh compared to Songsta. Not the cleanest UI, controls should be clearly labelled, but then all music apps have serious UX issues for new users. No one should have to guess how an app as widely downloaded as this works.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Great app - adverts bit of a pain but can't complain when you're getting music for nothing.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I have loved Spotify to death on my laptop, (750+ song on several playlists that I use a lot) but the tablet/phone version is terrible. There are ways to get around the shuffle limitation (really, Spotify? Really?) but I shouldn't have to deal with that. I realize that I'm not paying, but I shouldn't have to be. Spotify is not a radio app and should not ever act like one. It downloaded fine on my Kindle Fire HD, synced up my music beautifully once logged in, and as always most of the music I could ever want. I don't mind the ads, that's what premium is for. But again, the shuffle-only issue, and it refused to sync again to accommodate the playlist changes I made online, and said 'no internet connection' even when I had WiFi and my other apps had no problem with the WiFi. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled, but this time I got a different Spotify, even though it was the same app in the store. I think it was the premium version even though I never knowingly paid. It was fantastic - but I'm worried they might have charged me, so I uninstalled. It may have been some kind if free trial, but when I first reinstalled it told me there was a payment issue in the store, so I just tried again. If they charge me, I will raise hell, but as usual Spotify is (in my experience) an amazing app.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Android app is terrible!,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Terrible user interface. I try to play a song on my phone, but it plays on my Alexa upstairs (apparently it plays on whatever device you last played it on). Want to clear your song queue? No can do. Have to set up a playlist with only one song, and then play that. I only switched to spotify because I got a deal with the New York Times, but, boy, do I miss Napster.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Terrible! Free version is just junk. How do I uninstall this from my Fire? The music constantly shuffles so a song you want to listen to changes to a song similar. Seriously, how do I uninstall?",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Terrible, I can't even log on!",Spotify(3)
Negative,It was terrible. I hated it.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Unless you pay the premium subscription, this app is nothing but terrible, the same commercial five times in a row every ten minutes, they say they give you 30 minutes ad free if you watch these long videos, but then they force you to listen to whatever garbage they want in order to continue listening to what you want. I only got it because the ps4 got it, but this is horrible.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Was absolutely great. Now terrible and useless since the Spotify Connect forced updates. Used to be able to use Spotify app on my receiver by itself. Now HAVE TO use my phone to stream to the home theater receiver or other devices. What's the point of loading your app on my receiver if it will only work from my phone now (as of last week). It wouldn't recognize any devices - after fixing all the bugs and changing my device/receiver settings to get it to work, I realise they've turned a great app to an annoying, useless waste of space. I cancelled my Premium subscription and will uninstall the app. What a shame.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Originally I loved the app, I could look up songs and listen to them to make sure I found the right version I was looking for, now when I search a song I can't listen to it at all until I add it to my play list and then I have to wait since the app only allows songs to be played in shuffle mode. I liked it much better when I could listen to the songs when I wanted to. I understand with a free app I should expect ads, I don't have a problem with that, but this shuffle mode and not being able to hear a song sample makes this app terrible. I will be looking for a new way to listen to my favorite songs.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"If I could figure out how to get premium, I'd rate it 5 stars. Without premium, it's terrible. When you try to activate a premium feature, it just tells you that you can't activate it. It doesn't even tell you how to get premium, and I can't find the premium option anywhere. Unless you know how to get premium, do not get this app because it will be a waste of time.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I really used to love this app. It was my go-to for music. Then something terrible happened. Now I can't listen to what I want when I want. Now it plays suggested songs on shuffle instead of what I want to listen to. And let's face it, thats what Pandora is for.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"When I initially heard that Spotify would be free on mobile/tablets, I was thrilled. When I saw it wasn't the case on the Kindle, I was sad. When I noticed today that they'd uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.  Now, I'm just disappointed.  I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch. That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:  1. Without premium, one must be online to listen. Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?  2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle. Why is this a problem? Well, it's certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can't do that.  3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It doesn't have the best algorithm for this. Why is this a problem? If I'm listening to ""The Color Spectrum"" and it decides to throw a song from ""Migrant"" in the mix, that's really jarring. Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you (No, I don't like every album that band has put out.) or just lump everything into a few too-big categories (hip-hop, indie, rock, country) and throw the most random s*** from said category at you (And no, (new) Train is nothing like ""Of Great and Mortal Men"".). You only get a small number of skips if you don't have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet? Only it's not. Because that other app you're thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from ""Migrant"" at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.  Spotify on my computer? 5 stars. Spotify on my Kindle? I'll stick with Pandora.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Spotify is wonderful but there's a huge problem. When enabling music to play offline it causes all downloaded music to be stored in your internal storage bank which fills up extremely quickly. The lack of option to move the storage to an SD cards means very minimal download space. I love Spotify but this is just a terrible side of this app. Hopefully they fix it soon.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Randomly stops working. Will tell me there is no internet connection when there absolutely is one. Often will say 'Track not available' for no reason, even though it is on a playlist or actually stored on the device, and I do have an internet connection anyway. Often songs will say it is playing but there is no sound. Some songs just won't play, ever, no matter what. Sometimes songs are missing from an album. Huh? The 50% of the time Spotify works the way it should I like it, but the other 50% of the time is beyond frustrating. I blame the Kindle's terrible proprietary software for the problem as much as the app itself, though. Return your Kindle asap, buy a real tablet, download the regular Android version of Spotify that will actually work.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I can't even listen to music anymore because it has locked up on one ad and won't move on. Also the kindle fire doesn't really have a way for you to restart apps. In fact, all the apps on kindle fire are absolutely terrible.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I loved Spotify before the new update but now after the company decided to tweak it a bit and update a newer version, Spotify is now horrible. You can't choose what song you want to listen to (it absolutely INSISTS on shuffle play) and then you can only flip three or four songs before you are FORCED to listen to the current song. And I mean FORCED. You can't exit out of the song and pick a new artist, nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choices you have, the user has to have premium otherwise they can't see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow going to the next song, if it's a song you don't like from the artist, then you only have two more completely random tries before you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. For me though, I just deleted the app and went searching for another music app. Sorry Spotify, you just lost a customer. :/",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Y'all, please do not listen to ANY of the reviews that say this app is horrible. But please do not give any of your personal information to this app. Anyways, when I first got the app some of the reviews said DO not bye this app and most of them said DO bye this app. So o said to myself well it's worth a try. I got a account and looked for Sam Smith because I love his song I know I'm no the only one. The music plays while using different apps!!! Please please PLEASE get this app!",Spotify(3)
Negative,Horrible music list. Would preferred google music.,Spotify(3)
Negative,Well this app was good but the update is horrible. I would give this zero stars if I could.,Spotify(3)
Negative,I have this app on my android tablet but it doesn't make me have to listen to suggested songs!! It LETS me choose ANY song and a couple adds here and here. But this app is horrible compared to the one on my android tablet!!!,Spotify(3)
Negative,I won't let me upgrade it so I can't play any song which makes me really mad and I can't take it this app is horrible,Spotify(3)
Negative,"This app was horrible, I couldn't even sign up for it, -02299339929102039 STARS if possible",Spotify(3)
Negative,Horrible thing ever,Spotify(3)
Negative,"BEST SCAM EVER!!!! At first I couldn't believe people would pay for this service. Then I looked around at the examples of ineptitude around me. YES I CAN. Where to begin... First, disclaimer: I'm an audiophile. I do not get paid or profit in any way, even indirectly from any of these companies. I'm just a true music lover that happens to be logical also, and cannot stand by and watch people make a horrible mistake. So enough said... now let's get to the details. Or if not, skip to the bottom line. 1. Algorithm. Spotify is trying to do nothing else but copy the brilliant Music Genome Project (Pandora) algorithm, but fails miserably. All algorithms have to learn first, that's understandable, the problem is that there is something wrong with this algorithm, or the pool where it has to choose from is just not very good. I picked Alternative at one point, and 2 songs later Spotify shoves a New Age song at me, couple of songs after, I'm listening to Punk Rock. In short, Pandora's algorithm is certainly better, and that's an understatement. 2. GUI. Not horrible, but certainly not the best. Takes a bit to figure out where all is, and it's not automatically intuitive and at the ready. Takes you several clicks just to find where to skip the song being played. Note to developers: THIS SHOULD BE AT THE READY!!!! If it's playing, you have to give the choice to get rid of it on the fly. Minor tick on this one overall, but that skip should be nice and handy, which is a major flaw in my eyes. Nothing like being stuck or having to dig through a couple of menus just to get rid of a horrible song. 3. Paying to play owned music. This at first looked like a plus compared to Pandor, but in close analysis, it makes no sense to a logical person. While superior to Pandora in the fact you can play your own music (if you pay a monthly fee), if you own your music, why do you have to pay to listen to it AGAIN? And pay monthly????? Can someone make sense of this to me? Why are people paying for this, again???? Ridiculous. Developers: The idea to mixing streamed music as part of payment, should go hand in hand with being able to play the customer's already owned music FOR FREE!!! Otherwise, why even have this feature? Customers could just buy Poweramp, which they only have to pay for it once, for less than your monthly fee, AND has superior and more thorough features than your service. Let the people play their owned music for free. 4. Equalizer. Oh yeah, 5 bands. TOTALLY IMPRESSED. Look up Poweramp. 5. Cost. So basically, the only reason to buy this service, is to listen to new music on the fly, unlimited, right? Oh wait, the algorithm is not that good. Well, guess you will listen to music you don't like...A LOT. Oh yeah, and to boot, you want people to pay for the same thing as given by Pandora, but pay TWICE AS MUCH per month??? Did I mention this is a brilliant scam? HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE: If you want to listen to new, streamed music monthly, get Pandora (for half the price). If you want great sound quality and hands down the best music player in mobile, get Poweramp. Oh yeah, and you only have to pay once (for several devices, not just every device), and will cost you less than what you will pay in one month for Spotify.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Idk I only like Spotify because of how much music they have, that's an ok amount.. There's way to many ads and they're too long, this isn't TV, these aren't commercial break.. these ads don't need to be 4 mins long.. For a few 3 minute songs.. That's horrible, Spotify makes me wanna Kermit __",Spotify(3)
Negative,"First of all, I've been a loyal premium user (student subscription) for the last two years. I thoroughly enjoyed the desktop and mobile versions, as well the other features provided - offline streaming, Discover station etc.  However, beware of Spotify's horrible customer service and other difficulties when using internationally. First, I noticed that I was being charged a full price subscription ($9.99) for several months despite still being a student. The automated email response by Spotify's customer service stated that the student subscription is only valid for 12 months/academic year, and must afterwards be manually renewed. There was NO prior warning for this and I was charged $30 more, without the possibility of a refund - DESPITE still being a student. I even suggested that the extra charges be put towards future subscription payments and they refused.  Second, good luck using Spotify conveniently abroad. If you wish to change your method of payment while abroad, your credit card MUST match the country you are in - which is incredibly inconvenient for most users and those who frequently travel. Spotify does not offer advance-payments (i.e. 3 months or more) so this problem is difficult to avoid. Customer service is horrendously slow (24+ hours to receive an automated email response) and in most cases my question was not even addressed properly.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Its is amazing!!! It works perfectly on my Kindle fire but on my phone it us the worst, I can't listen to one song separately,I have listen to a whole shuffle and you only have an skip song limite, and it is just horrible so it will want u to buy Spotify premium, but on my kindle it is THE BEST APP ______so what I am saying is that it really just depends on what device u use or if u get Spotify premium. (Spotify premium cost money BTW)",Spotify(3)
Negative,It's horrible don't buy it.,Spotify(3)
Negative,Horrible,Spotify(3)
Negative,"This app was bla and I can't get into It because it says my e mail was taken from my brother but who screws up my e mail this was just bad horrible and really horrible",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Okay so I update spotify and it says I have NO internet while I'm clearly connected to the internet. I also hate how 3/4 of the options are only for Premium. This makes me an unhappy customer, I'm not going to waste my time buying some Premium when I could easily get my favorite songs from YouTube to mp3.",Spotify(3)
Negative,THIS APP IS AMAZING... I have this also for my computer and Ipod.. The one part I hate about it on my kindle fire is that you cannot pick what song you want to listen to it is just a shuffle play unless you want to pay. You get a certain amount of skips and I didn't know that so I just wasted all of them thinking I had unlimited.,Spotify(3)
Negative,Waste of money if you have Amazon Prime! It's far inferior.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Once you download this thing it wants you to create an account with either Facebook or your e-mail address to be able to use it, so don't buy it. It's just a waste of time. God, I want my old music app back, but I have no idea what it was called.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Have to oh to save music sucks wow only a7 day trail unreal dont waste your money download play tube you can save tracks free on that,Spotify(3)
Negative,If you have amazon prime this product is a waste of time. They don't tell you it's only a gimmick to charge you later.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Horribe, I got this for background but whenever I play game the music cuts. Don't waste your time with this. Just get Pandora",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Everything Is Great! But I'm Tired Of Ads,I Don't Wanna Buy Premium Because Thats A Waste Of My Money! I Would Give This 5 Stars If I Didn't Have To Buy Premium And Have No Ads This Would Have A Million Stars",Spotify(3)
Negative,Well I did like the app because of the 7 day trial but afterwards it didn't tell me how to get premium. I searched every part I could of the app and still could find no information on how to get premium. I use my kindle fire for this but I don't think that's the problem. I tried un-installing it and restalling it because it wouldn't fully get an update. It kept saying it couldn't finish installing. So I tried re-installing it only to see that it still couldn't fully get installed. Ive spent days trying to set this up and make it work only to see that I wasted my time. This app is a waste of time so don't install it... its completely worthless.,Spotify(3)
Negative,I tried signing up to use this app and I can't it won't let me do Facebook sign up or email :( guess that was aa waste of data to download,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Don't waste time and money with any other music playing app. Does everything that Pandora does, apple music and more. Plus the interface looks cool. If you are a student, make sure you look for the student discount which was 50% of for me.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Don't mind the title I couldn't think. This app is an amazing use and not a waste of time. Recommended for anyone who loves music. Though Spotify could use a couple of more night core songs. Other than that everything is fine __,Spotify(3)
Negative,"So this spotify crap, it works, it just stops every three songs or so. Just ephing stops, whether it be in the middle of the song, going to another song, doesn't matter. It just stops. When I go to press play it does nothing. How do you expect me to buy premium if it just stops? I rather just waste the 300 or so hours ot'll take for me to download all of my personal music on to my phone then deal with this crappy, crap.",Spotify(3)
Negative,It would be far better and I would give it a perfect rating if it had more free use instead of most of it being premium features that have to be paid for. I'm not paying money to use an app. Sorry ain't happening. What should have been free is the ability to make a playlist and also search for actual songs and play just single songs and that stuff isn't fee. It's a good app but it's not the best especially for those folks who don't have spare money to waste.,Spotify(3)
Negative,waste of time....,Spotify(3)
Negative,Waste of time,Spotify(3)
Negative,Multiple attempts to download on to both Ipad and Kindle failed. At least I hadn't wasted any money on this app.,Spotify(3)
Negative,You have to use a device to stream it to this app. Well duh. Why don't I just stream it from my device directly instead? Useless app. Embarrassing release from Spotifiy.,Spotify(3)
Negative,Useless. Never let me login,Spotify(3)
Negative,Wow I made the mistake of updating. So many regrets. Before the update I could pick the songs I wanted to listen to and add things to my queue without needing to pay for premium. This app used to be 5 stars. Now I have to pay to do anything other than shuffle a playlist... This is absolutely disappointing. Wish I could turn back time and not update because this app is pretty much useless to me now.,Spotify(3)
Negative,useless,Spotify(3)
Negative,It will not let me log into my existing account. It keeps telling me that I already have an account with that email address (duh) but does not let me log into it even though I tell it to 'log in' as opposed to 'create account.' The effect is that this ap is broken for me and is useless. Anyone from customer service reading this? Respond and help me fix it.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Was getting tired of Pandora so I hopped over to Spotify. Overall, I love it! I have the ability to choose the exact songs I want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music, which, btw, is great. I can easily access songs, artists, and albums through the my music section, and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations. I have hundreds of songs which I can access anytime (as long as I have a WiFi connection) and I'm glad the music continues to play when the screen is off (I use the app on a FireHD) I do, however, have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason I am dropping the rating from five stars to four. If I am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time (it's most likely to happen while I'm on the web) the music will sometimes stop playing completely, and I have to go back to to the app and reselect the song. (Which, btw, counts as a &#34;skip&#34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough, will trigger an add) Another similar problem involves the adds themselves: Sometimes an intro to an add will play (fyi I find these intros extremely annoying and useless) and the add itself will not play, even if I choose to play it. Other times the add will just stop playing mid-way through. On both of these occasions I cannot access any music, and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program, which, when I reopen the app, I am gifted with another add. However, through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this app, and I encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Useless. Refused to open. Locked up my Kindle fire.  Just a practice in app removal.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Like most of these type of apps the free version is great as long as you have Wi-Fi, but I live in the rurals and am often in areas wIth no connection. Then the app is useless, as well as at work, which is a government secured Wi-Fi, again useless. If I want to use offline I have to pay $10 per month, that's $120 a year. I'm already paying for Prime and I get free movies, t.v., books, and shipping as well as the music for $99 a year. So, why would I pay for this or anyone for that matter?",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Music was great had everything I wanted. At one point I was able to log on to my account on my smart TV, and my tablet and play from there. I am giving 2 stars because I was no longer able to sign on through my smart TV or my tablet and there was no customer service available to help fix the problem. Therefore it was useless to me...",Spotify(3)
Negative,Spotify doesn't work. Just a blank screen. Useless app. What more can I say. I don't need 20 words Amazon.,Spotify(3)

Negative,Excellent choice of music for whatever mood you might be in or want to be in!!,Spotify(3)
Negative,Good on tablet but I hate it on my phone,Spotify(3)
Negative,This app had all the music and barely any commercials. It made an awesome playlist and stored a lot of songs on each one.,Spotify(3)

Negative,Much better then other music apps out there. Good selections and premade playlists.,Spotify(3)
Negative,All my favorites in whatever list I make. A dream come true.,Spotify(3)
Negative,Spotify as a service is incredible. The app also is very well made.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Very good source of music. Has an almost unlimited collection to choose from. You can create your own playlists or choose from many already set up. Spotify can be used in your computer with no loss of selections made. There are 30 second commercials. There is a prime version that is commercial free. I find it easier to set up playlists and albums to listen to on my computer. Not certain about battery drain, it seems the steaming audio could use up battery life rather quickly. I have been using Spotify on my computer for several years and am happy to have a portable version available.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Spotify seems good. It feels like I can listen to whatever I want.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I love how you can listen to ANY song by ANY artist!!! Out of everything, my only fault would be you have to pay if you don't want that same advertisement to show up every few songs. I made a bunch of playlists with ALL my favorite songs, and even deceased singers that you still want to listen to, you can search their name and listen to every single one of their albums. Highly Recommended!!!",Spotify(3)
Negative,You can find whatever you want,Spotify(3)
Negative,The best music app ever made!,Spotify(3)
Negative,This app.is a.really beast app if you like remade playlists this is.for u,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I really thought it would be good at first because all my friends that had it said it was great. I ended up downloading a few songs and making a playlist, and then I went through a few &#34;top 50&#34; stations and added some more songs. Then its putting in songs on my library that I didn't add, saying recommended song. I want to listen to the songs I added, not some songs that suck that have nothing to do with the type of music I listen to. I just wish it was set up better also. Its really hard to find anything on there, and it gets really frustrating. I also hate that it shuts down right when I open it up. I just hope they fix the bugs soon.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Excellent music content. There is always a song for whatever mood you are in,Spotify(3)

Negative,I'm a music lover. Free music? Who could hate that?,Spotify(3)
Negative,"This app is EASILY the best music app ever. I've looked for an app that allows me to play my own playlist of songs and hand pick songs I want to listen to whenever, this is that app. If you're like me and don't wanna listen to playlists based off one musician you like, Spotify is the app for you. Create your own playlist, listen to whatever you want whenever you want. If you do like listening to playlists, Spotify has that as well. If I could give it more than five stars, I would, but for now, 5 STARS! Keep up the awesomeness Spotify!",Spotify(3)
Negative,U can whatever songs u want it's awesome,Spotify(3)
Negative,Hated when my free week ended.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"The app is a great app, my problem is how they have made this upgrade to purchase the premium package just to listen music. It hasn't been like this, and it was perfect before they made all of these exasperating changes. I do not like the fact that I cannot listen to the song I want to listen to, I hate this shuffle play because it will take albums and songs from other albums that I do not want to hear and put with the album, and it gets on my nerves. When I want to listen to &#34;Freak&#34; or &#34;Honeymoon&#34; by Lana Del Rey, I have to hear other songs of her with remixes that ruin her beautiful songs. It annoys me very much. I hope spotify gets my complaint and decides to make a change. When I want to upgrade, it doesn't me me. Soo, Spotify doesn't want me to be happy. Most of the Music apps are on Kit Kat 4.1 (Android) and iOS 7-9 (Apple) and I have a Kindle.",Spotify(3)
Negative,It is awesome I made my cuz get it and we got the free trile,Spotify(3)
Negative,"So I made a spotify account and it was really great for a few minutes then I accidentally pressed the prime button and now I have a bill I can't pay for . I decided to shut down my account I go to the settings and there is nothing to shut your account down . So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through what I just went through .  Best wishes",Spotify(3)
Negative,Love it. Perfect for whatever mood I'm in.,Spotify(3)
Negative,Idk how they did it but they made a perfect app!,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since ""sold"" this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs (if I am not mistaken) that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you won't have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it's going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you don't want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have ""disposable"" playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what's the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123. I love me some Spotify!!!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"love the music, hate the ads.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Great music selection and very User friendly. I would like the option to purchase premium, though. Also, great pre-made playlists with minimal advertising.",Spotify(3)
Negative,I am absolutely IN LOVE with this spotify!!! I recently changed from Pandora to spotify and am so happy I made the switch!! With spotify you can create playlists of songs YOU want to hear! And with only a couple dollars you can listen to your music offline as well. When you first create your account you get a month of free skips and other premium features. Or join near the holidays and get a SEASON of premium music.You can browse other people's created playlists and listen to new music fast. I listen to spotify literally ALL DAY and recommend it to everyone. Definitely a five star app.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I love this app. Which is why I'm creating a pro's and con's list for this app.  Pro's: á You can listen to tons of great music on the go.  á You can listen to whatever music you want.  á You can create your own playlists.  á You can folow your favorite singers.  á You get to customize your experience and profile.  á The music you listen to can stay private if you want or not if you want to share your picks with the Spotify world  Con's: I haven't found any! But I will try to keep you informed if I find any.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"It was perfect .... before the update.  Before: You could select whatever song you WANTED to play without having to put shuffle play and either wait for it to play or keep skipping until you get the song. (Though if you kept skipping chances are that you get an advertisement) Also, you were able to see the songs that were coming on next.  After (now): You cannot select whatever song you want to play. Which REALLY sucks. I always loved Spotify on kindle because you could pick a song. Now you can't put songs on queue or see what songs are going to play next. I always liked looking at the songs coming on next.  The update was just today. (9/9/15)   I feel so upset.  *The only thing that kept the same THANKFULLY is the ability to replay ONE song over and over again.  I want to kinda give up Spotify and just have Pandora since Spotify isn't very useful and takes up sooo much space. But I have some very good playlists.  I'm so very unhappy. I understand why they might have done that however I can't afford premium. It's not worth it. ):",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Spotify I feel is the best music app period. 1 being is that your not stuck having to listen to already programmed stations or set music/song lists. You can actually download full albums of literally who or whatever pops in your mind, and not just stuck to others options for music. I mean let's face it, were all different and Spotify definitely enforces that right to hear, listen, share and dance to any genre of music you or others are feeling at the moment. Another cool feature Spotify offers with having a premium account is another plan, such as the Family Plan. Yet again Spotify has personalized in so many ways to fit each person with there own individual preferences! Boom!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"This app was probably the best music app until their new update. Before I had probably around one thousand songs and could listen to any of them in whatever order I wanted to, but because of the update you can't take shuffle, play more than one song at a time, or skip songs without buying premium. This is incredibly inconvenient, and there are some songs I simply can't play anymore. Now if you want to play a song you have to set it on shuffle, so it chooses a random song (usually not the one I want) and stays on the song until I get frustrated and try to play another song from another album. If you get this app then I would buy premium because it is a good app; it's just a crappy update.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Its an amazing music app but its new upgrade has made it hard for my to even add songs to my playlists! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but nothing helped! Please bring this to your attention and fix this huge bug,Spotify(3)
Negative,"gives new music, albums, and singles. Love it. Hate the Mobile version though that's the only thing.",Spotify(3)
Negative,I used to be an avid fan of keeping recordings in my collections. I was constantly finding songs I wanted either they didn't have it available or you had to buy an entire album just to get one song. 99c to $1.29 adds up quick when you build up a collection. For this rate a month I don't need to keep all the overhead and I stream a lot. Only been twice I couldn't find something on Spotify. I wouldn't be surprised if you couldn't find it anywhere else either. They got pretty much everything ever recorded. You can stremit any tie you want and it's made more portable than carrying around CD's and ruining them or losing them.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Awesome app. I like the fact that you can search by artist and get JUST that artist, instead of getting a weird mix of music and wondering how in the hell THAT song made it in there. Also, the genre specific radio stations give a wide variety of artists, in case you're wanting to just have it on while you're working or working out. Just have the free version, thinking about upgrading to the premium to see what all the hub bub's about.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"The app is overall great it lets me Pick my own music and makes Custom Playlists for the music I like! Which is pretty amazing. I've been using this app for a solid year and things have worked out really good for me.  But there's just one thing I hate to go threw..... The ads  I just hate that tormenting Man's voice that just goes ""The next 30 minutes are add free! Thanks to are following sponsors.""  I like it because I can just watch the short ad video then I can get back to enjoying my music time.  But I can't play the ad it just freezes my App and Takes forever to load (Which sucks a lot since I'm a music lover)  Sometimes if I'm LUCKY! (See I caps the word lucky) The ad might play, But other times it doesn't play at all which freakin' stinks!  Anyway I don't know if other people using this app experiences any problems like these (I just hope not)  -That one random person who's ranting on a app about ads. How pathetic",Spotify(3)
Negative,"My family really enjoys this app. In fact, we made it our default music app on our Echo and listen even more than befo'. Get the family subscription and !ore than 1 can listen at a time without commercials",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Love this app. Much better than Pandora in my opinion, because you can make your own playlist, with your favorite songs. Only fault is that you have to buy a Premium if you want to be able to play certain songs when you want. You can only shuffle otherwise. You have a limited amount of skips, but more, it seems, than Pandora. They have all the songs I want. Even the most unknown to the people around me. Over all, a really fantastic app. Update: There was an update on my Kindle Fire HD, and now I can pick whatever songs I want to play whenever I want to play them.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Love Spotify, I pay for the premium sub which lets you save over 3000 tracks for offline play. Commercial radio is dead - Spotify is expanding podcast support making it a great audio choice whatever your preferences.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Something is very wrong with this app, it wants to reinstall itself everytime I open it, it's very slow at loading my music and I only have maybe a 1/20th of the amount I wanted to have, offline mode is kinda cool but still slow. And to top it all off, I made a new facebook and I had my spotify set up through my original account, so everytime I deactivated my original and opened spotify, it'd reactivate my account. But the kicker is I can't switch payment plans to another account so it's stuck on that until I get rid of spotify, which will probably be soon.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I am in love with Spotify, but ever since there are two problems I with the new update: 1) You can no longer choose a certain song, you must always click the shuffle button and skip untill you find the song you want to hear. 2) If you are listening your own playlist, the app now adds recommended songs on there too. Honestly, I think this made the app a lot less enjoyable, and I find it annoying. I think if they want to recommend you songs, they should e-mail you them like the old way.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I was reluctant to try this (ironically enough) because it's free and I figured the whole ""you get what you pay for"" adage is an adage for a reason. When Beats Music got bought out I figured I'd give Spotify a go before signing up with another subscription service. It's the best decision I've made in a long time.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I used to have pretty bad sleep insomnia but this app solved my problem the The doctor recommended a sound box for goin to sleep but I made a jazz Playlist and this app was a gold medalist in my Olympics this app is also the King of the music jungle",Spotify(3)
Negative,But I hate the ads,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I loved spotify until they got their new update. Now it'd similar to pandora and you can't choose what song , you can't listen to a specific song, and there is no longer a queue so you can't know what song your going to listen to. I hate the new update, now you only can use those things if you purchase the premium :( spotlight is a good app but now it's just not as good.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Way better than Pandora or any other music app I've tried, its also way cheaper than using iTunes since you don't have to pay for the songs you add. I love the fact that you can make your playlists how you want and if you have premium you can play any song you want whenever you want and play songs in whatever order you want all the time.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Discover has been severely downgraded in the new version and it makes it really hard to find other artists or albums similar to the ones you like. I hate this app now,Spotify(3)

Negative,"Specify is awesome to have, making your own playlists, listening to other people's playlists that they've made, and just relaxing to the beat ________",Spotify(3)
Negative,I love this app but the thing is it would be better if we did not need to have internet connection to use our playlists that we already have made so I give this app 3 stars,Spotify(3)
Negative,I opened the app and it first froze my entire kindle fire second restarted my fire and third made my fire remove all the apps on my SD card and this was the only app that did this too none of the other apps crashed not even one only Spotify,Spotify(3)
Negative,"This shuts down my new Apple desktop, for some reason! It always has! And it probably always will...It's probably because you're trying to install malware on my system!!! And my system is like coughing like a 100 year old man, & passes out* Since it freezes FIRST, before shutting down. I noticed this after an update too...Hmmm...So YES, you read that right folks! They are currently embroiled in a malware scandal! So far it only effects desktop computers. So I don't use it on my computer anymore. Only on my smartphone which is lagged so bad, that any playlist (online or off) has ever loaded up. It tries to load up the last song I played, & always gives me an error message. Instead I just hit ""Home"" before the load completes that gives me an error message. By interrupting it & selecting home, I can get to my playlist. Hate this drama. PS. Why are you taking away my favorite songs again?! Is it because you're also reported to NOT pay the artists' as much as their lawyers would want?! Yea, I read that about you recently as well!",Spotify(3)
Negative,Now let me just say if you're getting this application for your blackberry classic oh my god have I had the worst experience that I have ever had with an app. Don't get me wrong I'm pretty sure that it's my phone that makes it so slow and choppy and unsteady but this app sucks on blackberry classics. It works better on Passports. The experience I've had with this app is choppiness. Lag. freezes. crashes. unresponsiveness. It's just the worse. Spotify you guys have to make an application especially for Blackberries. Put it up on the BB world. Please. This sucks. And I'm a premium user for this s***? F that.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Best music streaming app if you're on premium. Worst app imaginable if you're on free subscription and a music lover who loves to listen to specific songs and artists. Someone like me. Even the most basic thing like choosing your own music isn't permitted, even on a limited basis. Not recommended if you aren't ready to spend $10/mo to go premium, which I find quite expensive, hence not an option for me at the moment. 1 star because there's no commamdable middle ground here, planned in a way to force users to go premium or stop using spotify altogether. __",Spotify(3)

You can't do anything without it saying this: oh magerd ya ned primiumm too doo dis ting$$!!$ 3. It's glitchy as sh!t.",Spotify(3)
Negative,OMG this is the best music app I have ever used they have whatever song u want and u can make ur own play list with the music u would like to hear!!!! I recommend to get this app u will LOVE it soooo much!!!!!,Spotify(3)
Negative,Not my favorite .I don't like the fact that you have to pay to listen to the song you want .. there other apps that you can listen without WiFi and whatever song you want.,Spotify(3)
Negative,This app sucks.__ I expected a lot more from this app. Don't get this app. I let my sister on this and she found really inappropriate stuff. This app is a waist of your time. I should have stuck with Pandora. I absolutely HATE this app.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________,Spotify(3)
Negative,Like the app but hate all the spam emails!!,Spotify(3)
Negative,I like spotlight but I hate that u need premium and hit shuffle play and choses a random song,Spotify(3)
Negative,____ geeqrt so far! Hate the eds but refuse to pay extra,Spotify(3)
Negative,This app is okay but I hate how it sucks on mobile and computer is hard to navigate.,Spotify(3)
Negative,I wish I could rate it a zero. I search a song and comes up with something totally different. I absolutely hate it,Spotify(3)
Negative,i love this app. i can listen to whatever i want!,Spotify(3)
Negative,Worst app ever,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Huge variety of music and pre-made / random playlist. Great browsing and easy to use. Love how it sync's up to almost all of my devices. Use it daily whether I'm listening to it on my Fire Tablet while reading, going jogging in the morning using it on my phone. Or even playing it on my ps4 through my T.V. while playing a game or just listening to it in the background. Offline playlist are nice for not eating up data with no wifi. Great Music App, its worth full membership for anyone who listens to music all the time in my opinion.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"This music app is probably the best music app out there I lidsten to music 24/7 and this one actually stays on the person, band, or whatever instead of going to other things lile Pandora does",Spotify(3)
Negative,"This is a wonderful app You can pick any song you want you just type the songs name then it will show different artist who made a song with that title and I bet you 100 percent your song you want wiil pop up",Spotify(3)
Negative,"So this app used to be awesome, you could listen to whatever music you want, except there would be ads, which is fine because I didn't have premium. I still didn't want to get premium because I don't necessarily feel like paying 9 bucks a month just To listen to music. But recently they changed EVERYTHING!!! Now you can't listen to a freaking song without hitting &#34;shuffle play&#34; and after that it gives you other songs that you don't even like and it doesn't let you listen to your own songs. Now you can't skip either, and you can only listen to 1 freaking song on your playlist, then it starts playing the suggested songs which you can't skip. Seriously?! Now it'd just making it so you HAVE to upgrade! What's the freaking point anyway?! You can just use YouTube and make playlists. Don't get spotlight unless you get premium!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I was introduced to Spotify by my son and immediately fell in love with it. I have a very eclectic taste in music and Spotify allows me to sample, search and/or select whatever suits my fancy at the moment. I particularly like the ""Discover"" function which recommends albums/performers/selections based on my past selections, but does delve into areas I had not previously encountered. That route has introduced me to performers I had never heard of in the past (and my past is pretty extensive). Also Spotify has allowed me to compile personal playlists of albums and/or selections that I particularly like. I use only the free download so I do have to listen to short commercials now and again (and they are repetitious), but since most of my music listening is via radio, that is no biggie. I highly recommend Spotify to music listeners of any genre>",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Very ""manual transmission"" in design. For some, this is a great thing. You control EVERYTHING about your catalog, You can choose songs or albums to save. I'm ambiguous on what ""follow""-ing an artist actually means... but whatever. For those that are stuck in automatic transmission mode (pick some thing and let it unfold how it wants), all this freedom can seem horrifying, It took me a few days to re-adapt myself to the freedom that the app offered.  No consideration is really given for what you already own. This could be frustrating if it isn't considered that a person can arbitrarily add any single track (that the service is aware of) to the person's own catalog.  For a person with a PC background, trying to add things (while the well behaved android thing runs) can be confusing/annoying. This isn't a criticism of the app, which seems to do fairly expertly what it does... But, The ""Oh, ya. There might be desktop users."" thing seems to be an afterthought. This isn't a criticism of the app itself. It can only do what it is programmed to do, But, [desktop user manipulating user's library] seems to (unfortunately) be an afterthought at best.  As to music sources, there's few things lacking as I can tell. In particular (as of this date). Yanni - Optimystique seems to be absent, and to access the songs I remember I have to use ""Winter Light"" (a newer album/rehash, or whatever). I can live with that.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"It was a good music service until they made it like mobile where you have to shuffle rather than play any song you want. Especially sucks when you listen to bands who's albums are like books: meant to be listened to from beginning to end, not out of order.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I used to love the Kindle Fire version. I liked how it was basically the same as the computer version. No harm was done. I was fine without premium. The ads didn't bother me too much. Then, the new update happened. Now its the exact same as the phone version. I have always hated the phone version for a reason. There is basically no freedom on it. I already have to limit my time on Spotify because this tablet only connects to wifi, but now I just don't want to use it. There was no harm in keeping this version the same as the computer. Profit isn't an excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you as a company are crippling artists' profit at the same time. I'd rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price is a lot more reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I'm really encouraging you to change it back because I guarantee that you've lost many users to this and you're just going to lose more. I used to recommend Spotify to people, but now my view has changed. Its just not worth it anymore, so I'll just spent my time warning people off of this half baked app. You're Welcome, Spotify",Spotify(3)
Negative,I hate when I try to make a que and load albums together and it shows up on my currently playing album so I have to drag songs from current album from bottom to top,Spotify(3)
Negative,"THE best music app of all! I was a subscriber to a monthly music service for years. Then I found out about Spotify. I had several gigabytes of music files on my computer and in the cloud. When I found Spotify, I made the decisione to get rid of all that and save space on my hard drive.You don't actually BUY the music, so you can't burn CDs or make other copies, but you CAN have the app on all your devices, so the music goes with you wherever you want. I connect the Bluetooth on my phone to my car's sound system, so I can listen to what I want....and no commercials! You can create your own playlists and fill them with the actual music you want...not 'sounds like' the music you like And the best part is that you can make your playlists available offline, so you don't have to have an Internet connection to listen to your music.Another nifty feature of Spotify is the ability to view the lyrics of what you're listening to if you want. All the information about the artist is also available if you want to know more about the artists you're listening to.  And for those people who are devoted to social media, Spotify also allows you to connect with friends and see what they are listening to and you can make your playlists public as well. I don't use those features, but they are available.  This is the app I use more than any other on my devices. I just love it.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Spotify is absolutely wonderful. I am in my 60's and really hate being exposed to do much of the electronic things. But my daughter thought I should have this and I am so grateful that she did. I have had so much fun getting all the old songs on a playlist (yes, and some new songs). I cannot praise you guys enough for such a user friendly program for all ages to enjoy. Thank you!!!",Spotify(3)
Negative,I love it. It is the best music app made. I just don't know how to get premium plz tell me how too,Spotify(3)
Negative,You should take a minute to try this you will love it! It's free and you can save your music for offline play also. You can find your songs and artists easily. The application is SO easy to use that you will really enjoy it. You don't have to do a million things to play music on this site. It's free so give it a try. Enjoy! Thank you makers of SPOTIFY MUSIC !! You made this APP worth while.,Spotify(3)
Negative,I love how I can listen to whatever song or artist I want and still have radio stations that at are based on what I listen too.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"There are many apps that allow users ÒfreeÓ access to music but it usually comes at the price of extensive advertisement interruptions or limited streaming capabilities. The Spotify app combines inexpensive buy-in with user-friendly layout to make it worth spending a few dollars a month on a music streaming app.  In terms of a free app, the Spotify app limits users in that they cannot stream music without Wi-Fi. Once the user decides to pay for the Premium version of the application, these restrictions no longer apply and the app becomes the perfect suite for music discovery and library curating. For this review, I will be assessing Premium Spotify and not the free version of the app.  The cost for students is very affordable with a discount bringing the original price of $9.99 down to $5.99. Although for some this may seem pricey, access to unlimited music means one only needs to add 5 songs a month to reach the price per song threshold that surpasses the value of the iTunes store which charges $1.29 per song. Many will add more than this amount in new music a month and will find that it is much more affordable than other means of purchasing music and is available without Wi-Fi and without using oneÕs data plan if saved to a specific playlist.  This is more efficient, affordable, and legal than the means available for music streaming in the past. Free applications such as Limewire or its predecessor Frostwire were based on a system of file sharing that was shaky in its legality and often led to viruses being downloaded onto oneÕs computer. Many of the songs were incompatible file types for iTunes which made it difficult to access music on cell phones or media players. Spotify makes it easy to access your music library by allowing integration with iTunes libraries and having cross-platform apps that can be installed on a variety of devices.  Spotify has over 30 million songs in its catalog and adds around 20,000 songs each day. One still may not be able to find songs that may be readily available on applications like Soundcloud. In comparison to apps like Pandora Spotify also falls short because often times the music it chooses to match songs of your choice are either by the same artist, or are characteristically exactly the same as the selected song and offer no variety. Looking for new music often falls upon the user to search and sort through the vast catalog of music on their own.  All in all, Spotify remains my top choice for music streaming based purely on its low price and extensive catalog. Supplementing Spotify with free apps like Soundcloud and Pandora work well to complement Spotify in the areas where it falls a little short. Even with its shortcomings, the price, music catalog, user friendly layout, and compatibility with multiple devices make it the best choice for music streaming.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I found this app on a vacation in France, after Pandora told me I couldn't use out in Europe. Unlike leading music apps/radios, you can create playlists, listen to already made playlists, or, my favorite, just search up particular songs, artists, or genres. Usually, on Pandora our iHeart radio, you just listen to whatever is on a certain radio of your choice. After using this app, I have found absolutely every song I've looked for but one. It works great, but like all others, needs Wi-Fi or cell service. But it's still totally worth it. 5 stars!!!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Spotify sleeping music choices are amazing, and have a better selection than all of the sound machines I have ever owned. The other music and video shorts are great as well. The navigation setup is easy, and it all interfaces well with my Samsung, whi h is unusual. I am not inthe iworld, and often let down by the &#34;made for android&#34; apps. This was NOT disappointment. :)",Spotify(3)
Negative,I enjoy the wide variety of music that is available on Spotify. However I do not care for all of the extra phone that they call recommended. When I make a playlist I want it to play those songs not whatever it wants that they think is similar to those songs.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"After using this app for a year or so and loving it on my walks and work-outs, I finally caved in and went add-free. I am impressed! As we speak I am listening to Coffee Table Jazz -- which is one of the many Jazz and Blues stations. Anything you want you can find, whatever suits the mood. I'm sure I'm not using it to its fullest yet, so this gives me a whole new world of music to explore. Love it so far. (I haven't tried using it offline yet, but this was one of the main reasons I went Premium.)",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Why is spotify better then all of the other music apps? Keep in mind just like every other music app if you want unlimited anything you have to pay a price. Spotify is 99 cents for the first 3 months and then 99 cents for each additional month(cheapest out of them all) _offline listing _make your own play lists _unlimited skips _share play lists with friends _good suggestions but not alot (it's not annoying _ if the Playlist says g-eazy they are actually going to play g-eazy. Not iggy isalias. _Multiple playlists _with premium you can look up a whole library of music by search word (ex: country hits or Katy perry) and you can look through a already made Playlist or albums upon albums of music and you can play whatever you choose. Personally I was a Pandora person but a friend forced me to use it for a week and once you build up your Playlist with the music you like you will forget about Pandora or whatever you currently use. Also spotify graciously gives you a week free of premium use which will help you build your Playlist (although if you want to add a song to your Playlist you can just look it up spacificallly and hit the 3 dots on the right and hit the plus) So my overall advice for this app is try it out for a few days do the free trial and enjoy. You don't need premium to enjoy this app. Ads are reasonable not annoying",Spotify(3)
Negative,"This app has changed how I use my Kindle Fire. I basically only download apps that are free and broadly used, and Spotify is simply the best of the best. Spotify lets you try a week of their premium version free without asking nosy and annoying questions. Use the app to discover new and old music, it is so much fun. Although their library is not necessarily universally inclusive, the music quality is quite excellent and the software is easy to navigate I like to make my own playlists and also just to play specific artists' large backlogs on Shuffle. Highly recommended, this will probably be your most used app - yes, even the free version. I am so glad they made a version for Kindle Fire.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Sorry, I d made the decision by mistake. I love Spotify so much I use it as a sleep aid or to help me relax after a rough work day. I love the choices offered plus u can customize the music based on personal moods. It s one of my favorite apps.",Spotify(3)
Negative,What a fantastic app!!! I love everything about jt. I opted for the premium version and the selections and sound quality are 5 star!!!! I also have a headphone amp I connect and the sound quality is superb! I'm listening through Beyerdynamic DT 880's. These have VERY high resistance (ohms) and normally could not be driven by a smart phone(these headphones retail for $550) u can't believe the sound with Spotify ' s equalizer and my homemade amp and the Beyerdynamics!!!???#!#?,Spotify(3)
Negative,"will never go back to Pandora I Have a list of 3000 songs put it on random everything from metallica to Madonna pat benitar to pato Banton have a live music list, reggae list, 80s new wave list, I even have a list of my top 50 or so songs and only allow myself that list if I am exercising,, free is great",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I'm a classical music enthusiast and hate most music apps for their inability to treat multi-movment classical works in their entirety. At least the paid version of spotify let's me turn off ""shuffle"" so I can play whole albums in proper track sequence. Same for playlists I create. Information on the pieces is sadly without detail, generally not including all of composer, conductor, and performer.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"This is the most awesome player that has every tune that I have asked it for and more! It is easy to use and convenient to access from PC, phone, tablet, whatever!",Spotify(3)
Negative,Awesome! Best way to listen to music!!! I can listen to whatever I want any time of every day! Spotify is Awesome!,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Sooo cool.I love listening to music, but at the same time hate the adds.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Spotify is great on tablets and computers because you can play whatever you want just for ads, but on a phone its still good but not free for everything (which is understandable. I love it more than amazon music because it has a larger variety of songs AND talk shows.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Spotify has all the music I like and it's easy to set up your lists. You can find whatever you want to listen to.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I hate the new update, it use to be good until it updated",Spotify(3)
Negative,"App is awesome but the customer service is horrid. We cancelled a free trial we set my mom up with but for whatever reason, the cancellation didn't process. We were charged several months for no usage (because we thought it was cancelled). Spotify had no interest in discussing a refund or anything really. Keep in mind, I already have my own premium account and have had it for YEARS.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Love that I can add all the music I want to a playlist of my own creation, or choose to listen to an already made playlist. Its a great way to be introduced to new music/artists. When listening any where else but your computer, playlist can only be listened to with shuffle. This works perfect for me, its what I end up doing anyway.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I love Spotify so much I use it pretty much everyday, I've made so many playlists. And I have premium now which let's me listen to songs without those annoying commercial interruptions",Spotify(3)
Negative,"When I first heard about Spotify I thought it was just another streaming music service but boy was I wrong.  It's just what I been looking for! An avid Jazz fan I cannot tell you how many titles I have found that weren't on many of the other services. Whatever your genre Spotify has it!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Love the music selection, hate the limitations.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I was very skeptical at first, I mean... Free music, really? But it's great! You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it's totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!",Spotify(3)
Negative,It is pretty good because it allows me to listen to many songs wether it's fan made or actual music,Spotify(3)
Negative,"This amazon version is way better than the phone version. On the phone version you can only save your favorite songs then have them shuffled. You can't pick what ever song you want. However, on this app, you can choose whatever song you want, shuffle the music, all with just a few ads every 30 minutes.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I switched from I heart Radio to Spotify at my boyfriend's suggestion, and I haven't gone back. I enjoy building my own library, and I've made and shared playlists with a couple of people. I also like that you can add others' playlists to your account. I find this app to be extremely easy to use and plan to continue it as my favorite music app.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Its great I love it!!!!! My got to app for music!!!! But I think that it should make an update letting people like me that have a kindle. Or any phone or table or whatever. It should let us listen off of internet connection. I mean I got this app for me to listen to music. It should at least let me listen off internet connection. But in other words I highly recommend this music app!!!,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Songs with explicit content are constantly deleted without reason, there's no enough music and the app version does not allow you to choose your song (Shuffle mode), I miss grooveshark so much, spotify sucks big time. :(  I hate the fact that the ""offline mode"" is only music stored in your cache memory and you don't actually own the song, so it's not worth it to pay for the premium user because you are not downloading the songs you can't keep them, recomendations are not accurate with what I would like to listen to, and radios have always the same songs.  Have been a daily user since grooveshark was closed, actually I think spotify should be free, because you don't get what you pay for.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"So yeah, it was nice when I first downloaded it. I got to choose what song I listened to, and I didn't have a limit on however many songs I could skip. Oh, but then here comes this bulls***, I can't choose what song I wanted, it suggests songs that I couldn't care less about, and now I can't even skip it because I've reached my limit, skipping the songs I don't want to listen to.  I got an app that wasn't like Pandora, and it was hella nice. But now it's changed into the equivalent of that.  To sum it all up, I can't choose my own music I couldn't care less about the suggested music I hate the song-skip limit  I just wanted to listen to one song, but then I end up listening to ten because I'm unable to skip over to the song I want.  I'm just disappointed, tbh.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I love spotify, it's easy to use, and there is a wide collections of music to choose from. Whatever genre you want, it's there. I definitely recommend this. You can open a new app, and the music will still be able to play.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"It would be nice if it didn't get slower with each update. For whatever reason theres now a lenghty black screen before loading the artist list. It used to be a 5 in my book, but there's ni reason it should take longer to load on a new device.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Love the music, but hate that I can not filter out explicit songs. We subscribed to the family package but are rethinking our decision. We do not like that we can not filter the music on our kid's tablets. We also have to be careful when playing music in the house. I have checked online and there are years worth of complaints about this same thing. Why hasn't Spotify fixed this?",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Love Spotify, hate that my favorite Dead Milkmen album isn't available. But that's not on Spotify, that's on their dumb label.",Spotify(3)
Negative,I love this app but the one thing I hate is to get more I have to pay for it otherwise I like the way it gives me the full album of the music I look for witch it's alsome,Spotify(3)
Negative,"The only thing that annoys me, and I just don't understand, is why am I permitted, even with a free account, to play whatever specific songs I wish when using Spotify on my computer, yet with my smartphone I'm powerless to do so?  Seems rather inconsistent.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Amazing app, has become a daily routine of using it. Hate the adverts so decided to pay monthly and love the fact that you can download the music offline and also use the account on multiple platforms and devices.",Spotify(3)
Negative,It is great when by clicking you just find whatever you want or even you had liked when you were kid. It wonderful.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"This is a awesome app.I can play whatever music I want,and still not have to pay anything!only that it gives me adds to go premium to get rid of them.still good though!",Spotify(3)
Negative,Spotify is a must have for our household. The music selection is amazing. The app is so easy to use that my 3 year old can navigate it to find the playlist I made for her. love this.,Spotify(3)
Negative,I love the new interface that Spotify has designed with their mobile apps - mostly very intuitive and genuinely beautiful with their use of album art and photos in the backgrounds. The way the now playing panel appears in the notification pull down is gorgeous and rounds out a great music listening experience on my Kindle. I just wish it were caught up to whatever Amazon's security standards are because the pop up warning prior to opening it every time is a tad bit annoying.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Because it is awesome: it has thousands of good songs and already made playlists for certand events, its so cool and awesome Because it is kinda awesome: it only has shuffle and a certand amount of skios",Spotify(3)
Negative,A must have app for music lovers. An improvement could be made to radio stations created from playlists. They are not as diversified as the playlists themselves.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Love it. Don't particularly care for the ads, but it's a great way to accumulate the greatest music ever made, the 80's.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Spotify is a very very well made app to listen to music on. When you turn on Pandora you deal with advertisements and more. With Spotify advertisements are almost non-existent. The only thing that does need to be implemented is a setting to turn off or take out swear words. All in all this app is a very good app and I recommend this app to anyone who wants some music in their day.,Spotify(3)
Negative,This is definitely the best music app. I use Spotify Premium and it is amazing. I can listen to whatever song I want when I want. Strongly Recommend!,Spotify(3)
Negative,Very good app. Allows u 2 listen music that u want 2 whenever u want. U do need WiFi. Allows u 2 make playlists and save albums and songs. Ah can also follow artists. Although 1 time I made a playlist and after the first song it would play songs from an album I had not saved. But a very good app. I recommend this 4 anyone who loves music.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I thought Spotify would be complicated, but it is actually easy. It doesn't cost money yet it has nearly every album ever made! I can listen to music while on the internet- on Youtube, you can't go onto another tab or the music will stop. I highly recommend this app for all ages! __",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Spotify has been my favorite music streaming app and one of my favorite apps in general. I can listen to all the music I want and make my own playlists, or list to playlists that were already made up. The sound is great and it's really easy to use. I'll continue to use Spotify because it's a great app.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Amazing. Simple. Modern and stylish. Great quality. Exhaustive library of songs. Fun to use.  There's many easy ways you can listen to music. Whether you'd like to simply create a unique playlist of your own, listen to entire albums, create a radio station, or tap on browse to listen to playlist already provided to fit whatever mode your in, all are simple, fun ways to listen to the music that you love.",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Title says it all. Pandora maybe great, but it has nothing on Spotify. The ability to pick and choose your songs is in of itself amazing, but add on the fact they have these custom made playlists with almost all types of genres from Today's Pop to 60s and from Rap to Concentrated Scratch. This app truly is a music lovers choice.",Spotify(3)
Negative,The worst add in premen fechers,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I love spotify! I hate I waited so long to get it. They have a huge selection. So far, I've found everything I wanted and more!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"This is is amazing for all types of people.... if your into gospel, pop, r&b, rap, hip pop, country, calm, energetic, techno, etc. whatever genre it is...it's there!! I fall asleep to all of my favorite music, artists, or genres....overall it's amazing!! Also, for premium it's $0.99 for 3 MONTHS!!!!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"Awesome, I definitely recommend it for most anyone who wants to listen to whatever music they want. You can make a playlist with literally any song there is out there. It's amazing, 5 stars.",Spotify(3)
Negative,I hate that they don't have all the songs like they have there other songs but not the one I'm looking for I don't get it. I'm hating that I can't play the song I have to click shuffle like it's fine with my playlist but when I'm searching you don't need to do that. Over all I love it but now I'm just getting annoyed with it.,Spotify(3)
Negative,It was amazing to type in the name of an artist and instantly listen to whatever I wanted to play--no interruptions--that was truly exciting.,Spotify(3)
Negative,"Guys and women. This is the best music app that can be made. It has any genre you would want. From R&B to hip-hop, punk heavy metal, etc. And when I say everything I mean everything",Spotify(3)
Negative,'I don't like it I hate it it is not good quality stops at too many times app won't open at all I don't like it at all I hate,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I love this app for its wide selection on free music, but I hate the way it works. Why do I have to pay money for me to be able to hear the songs I want to hear when I want to!?! Since the last update for the kindle version, I have to click shuffle to go through EVERY song I saved to find the one I want to hear. Thats just ridiculous. I think i'll find an app that I can listen to music that I want to hear. Ha! Forget it im going back to pandora!",Spotify(3)
Negative,"I was amazed with spotify at first, i could skip all the songs i eanted and i could play whatever song i wanted even without permium. Then i got the update... i am highly frustrated with the new update you can only skip a few songs and cant play the songs you want. Spotify WAS better than pandora but not anymore.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Really love the fact that you can choose whatever music you want to hear and you can just about listen to everything classical to rock to rhythm and blues and jazz have no complaints love it,Spotify(3)
Negative,It has all of the music I love plus you can find just about anything just by searching. Falling to sleep to the nature sounds or thunder and rain has made me sleep much better. Waking up to my favorite tunes or discovering new favorites in the morning before work is priceless. Thank you Spotify!,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I get stress easy, so to have this app that have music to calm me is very handy specially when there's no WiFi. At first I hate spending the amount a month but so worth it.",Spotify(3)
Negative,Spotify has tons of great music but when you go to different apps while listening to a song it stops playing and you have to go back to the app. Also those ads that are supposed to give 30 minutes of add free music play almost after every song you listen to. I hate to say it but I might go back to SoundCloud,Spotify(3)
Negative,"I have only one bad review for this. When I try to buy premium, it sends me to the internet browser and enter my credit card. I don't have a credit card, so I'm not able to get premium. :( Asides from that, everything is awesome. I'm able to find whatever music I want (except a lot of anime ops) and I only get a few adds.

I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version.

Here's how I'll put it: Spotify makes me feel rich because l have access to almost all the music that l can ""think of."" And the best part is the cost: which is free. Love it when l (and you) win as we do with this app. I wish most other ""basics"" were just like Spotify! Perhaps a day will come (sooner than later) that disrupt things so that life become an affordable luxury --as Spotify has done for music! Great app!",Spotify(3)

The point of ads is to help sell your product but if it has no relevants to what I like or even listen to then it has failed its purpose. I think you should have ads based on what you listen to even if that means using peoples saved music to get the idea of what they like. The supply of music on this is great I have found everything I wanted to find and that's better than other apps like Pandora. I get to at least listen to the band I want to even if its not from the same album ( suggested songs take from other albums and play songs from there )",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Premium is great even without it, it has more choices than Pandora",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Works great, few crashes and most of my favorite artists",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app is simply amazing. It's musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a ""station"" or ""mix"" and that feature is decent. The algorithms aren't great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that don't want to pay for premium service, you don't have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I'm aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you don't need to pay $9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they don't email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I've had my account for 5 months and I don't think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. :)",Spotify(3)

Positive,"I really thought it would be good at first because all my friends that had it said it was great. I ended up downloading a few songs and making a playlist, and then I went through a few &#34;top 50&#34; stations and added some more songs. Then its putting in songs on my library that I didn't add, saying recommended song. I want to listen to the songs I added, not some songs that suck that have nothing to do with the type of music I listen to. I just wish it was set up better also. Its really hard to find anything on there, and it gets really frustrating. I also hate that it shuts down right when I open it up. I just hope they fix the bugs soon.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"You can get pretty much any type of music and make a great playlist, but I can't seem to get away from commercials! Maybe there's something I'm doing wrong, but if I play my downloaded songs, even they have commercials every 3 songs. (I suppose I could pay to upgrade and maybe I'd lose the ads, but I'm not willing to do that, as I don't listen to music constantly - or enough to pay a subscription price to go without ads. I'd rather buy a CD if that's the case). I don't like the Playlist Radio, because it plays songs that are nothing like the playlist. It's irritating. The info says that Spotify gets to know what you like, but I have zero Abba songs (and nothing like that on my playlists), but yet what songs do they inject right after the 3d song on my playlist? Some idiocy by Abba, of course. I suppose I was too optimistic in hoping that Spotify was like using your MP3 or iPod. I guess they have to make money somehow. Still, I do enjoy being able to play (somewhat without interruption) a grouping of songs I have chosen.",Spotify(3)

In any case, this application is totally astonishing, waay superior to apple music which is only a more costly duplicate of spotify, spotify is free unless you need premium, however in the event that you don't have premium and you play mudic on rearrange it really gives great suggestions for melodies, for instance in case you're tuning in to lethal by britney lances since you like that tune or like me are in the phandom or something they won't play like my substance sentiment after, they will reccomend like a tune like dangerous.

Positive,"The app is a great app, my problem is how they have made this upgrade to purchase the premium package just to listen music. It hasn't been like this, and it was perfect before they made all of these exasperating changes. I do not like the fact that I cannot listen to the song I want to listen to, I hate this shuffle play because it will take albums and songs from other albums that I do not want to hear and put with the album, and it gets on my nerves. When I want to listen to &#34;Freak&#34; or &#34;Honeymoon&#34; by Lana Del Rey, I have to hear other songs of her with remixes that ruin her beautiful songs. It annoys me very much. I hope spotify gets my complaint and decides to make a change. When I want to upgrade, it doesn't me me. Soo, Spotify doesn't want me to be happy. Most of the Music apps are on Kit Kat 4.1 (Android) and iOS 7-9 (Apple) and I have a Kindle.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"So I made a spotify account and it was really great for a few minutes then I accidentally pressed the prime button and now I have a bill I can't pay for . I decided to shut down my account I go to the settings and there is nothing to shut your account down . So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through what I just went through .  Best wishes",Spotify(3)

Positive,"With an almost surprisingly large catalogue, there is something for everyone. You can discover (or rediscover) all kinds of great music. The app runs great, I haven't had any real problems. The only problem I do have is with some of the artists pulling their music, but I can't really fault spotlight for that. The ads for the free version can get a bit annoyingly repetitive at times but it's not so bad. Personally, I find paying for the upgraded version is HIGHLY worth it, especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only is it ad free, but you can listen to music offline, which is great for things like long car trips.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Great music app. I've had premium for years. One thing I don't like is that sometimes when you have a song downloaded, it will change to a different version. ie:I've had ""Walk the Line"" by Johnny Cash downloaded on a playlist for a long time, then one time when i was listening to that playlist and it played that song, it was a live version, rather than the one i had initially downloaded. This has happened a few times with other songs. They would switch to covers, instrumentals, or live versions. Other than that, I love everything about this app.",Spotify(3)

Positive,Great app for music but wish there weren't commercial,Spotify(3)
Positive,Awsome it is just a great app.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since ""sold"" this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs (if I am not mistaken) that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you won't have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it's going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you don't want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have ""disposable"" playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what's the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123. I love me some Spotify!!!",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Spotify is my main source of music. It is available on every device including Roku, and has the ability to put together play lists. I used to download mp3s and it took hours of my life transferring them onto devices or cds. I had to pick one track out of entire albums constantly, and it was a pain. I am an early adopter of Spotify and the Internet in general. I remember when Yahoo Music came out. I was there for the controversial Napster, and the embracing of mp3 as a legal format to sell albums on iTunes.  Spotify could stand to give a bit more back to artists, but I love I pay a monthly fee and can support musicians just by listening as usual. I love it has a high quality play back mode and an offline mode for when you lose service. I still think it's important to purchase music, but as a culture streaming will be vital to the new model being built in the music industry.  Spotify links to last.fm accounts for charting your music, you can add local files to it, and it has great Playlist choices, recommendations from friends, stations, and more. If you're a music lover you will love this app as you have much more control over what you listen to, and is great at helping you discover new music! While supporting artists.  I highly recommend to anyone who doesn't already have Spotify. It's my daily driver, my go to, my happy place. I've been using it since it came out and I am ever grateful for it in my life. I just upgraded to a family plan so everyone can enjoy and make their own play lists.  I'd also like to add the app is smart. If you have it running at home the use it on your device it will switch to the new device seamlessly. Pretty cool right?  I think so!",Spotify(3)

Lots of ads, but there are also times where you can get up to a half hour of ad free music. They don't have actual radio stations either. You can make playlists and while not all the music is available, there is a wide variety. You need a decent WiFi connection or it won't work that well. Searches are kind of irritating because you look up a song and it shows cds, artists, and songs with related or same words. It also doesn't have the option to delete/deactivate your account. Overall, it is only great if you spend money to buy premium, but is a decent source of music if you have WiFi.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Definitely has become my favorite app. I like all kinds of music, but I would have to say jazz is my favorite genre. I am amazed at how many artists and bands I have been introduced to via Spotify. I love the ""related artists"" sections provided, that let's me explore even more bands I just hope I have enough time, left here on earth, to hear it all. Also having the ability to play your music on pretty much any device you can think of is great. Keep up the good work. Worth every penny of my subscription.",Spotify(3)
Positive,New great,Spotify(3)
Positive,Ease of use great library,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify if you're familiar with &#34;Americas top 40 hits&#34; u can keep up easily with pop songs, it's perfect for that. Also great for relaxed order of songs and if you're ok with limits to skips. I myself have grown tired of pop songs and needed more remixes and smaller songs that never find their way to the top 40. In summary, Compared to apps like rdio and Pandora it's a big one up for pop songs, but if you're after smaller artists sound cloud is the way to go.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Well, my friend had this app for a little while on her IPhone, and she LOVED it. Sometimes she used it without wifi, and it ate up all of her data. I have a kindle, and it's either me or it makes everything else.... slow. I'm worried it'll use up my data too. Besides that, it's pretty great. So...... overall, I recommend it for extreme music lovers who only want THEIR music played. The ability to create your own playlist (for free) with any music is my kind of heaven. Thank you Spotify!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Putting aside the whole ethical debate over artist's royalties+spotify, this app is great. Easy to use and everything comes in crystal clear; it turns my kindle into a jukebox at parties and get-togethers. It even has a great selection of some of the more obscure songs and albums that are next-to-impossible to get physical copies of. Again, judging the app, not the ""musician vs spotify"" debate. That said, definitely recommended!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"You can find just about any song that you can imagine. Rock, rap, metal, edm, it's all here. Great loading times on the kindle. Just a few ads for non premium users, but it's more than worth it for freedom in your music. A must download for any human that likes music.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is easy to use and works great when you do not have an FM tuner chip in your phone. I have the Samsung Galaxy S4 and of course I would own the one without the FM tuner chip so radio apps will not work I like this because I can play an artist, genre or a decade!",Spotify(3)
Positive,I've used a lot of music apps over the years but I've never found one as great as Spotify and I loved the app so much I even upgraded to the Student Premium which is even better. And for $4.99 a month you can't beat the price or the quality.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great hit on songs,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Was a Rhapsody customer for years but the playback experience would only get worse & worse until the point of being unbearable when it wouldn't even playback my downloaded songs so I looked for a replacement & came across Spotify when introduced through Sprint and have never looked back. Far superior product, zero playback issues & they had AC/DC songs which Rhapsody did not. How do you not have one of the greatest rock bands of all time??",Spotify(3)
Positive,"It has a great selection of music. When paired with Pandora, this app is a great way to discover new artists or music. Some may complain about having to pay for more freedom in playing music. While this is a downside, one can always purchase the soundtrack from Amazon, Google or in a physical store. Or dig deep and apply for premium. __",Spotify(3)
Positive,"The app is overall great it lets me Pick my own music and makes Custom Playlists for the music I like! Which is pretty amazing. I've been using this app for a solid year and things have worked out really good for me.  But there's just one thing I hate to go threw..... The ads  I just hate that tormenting Man's voice that just goes ""The next 30 minutes are add free! Thanks to are following sponsors.""  I like it because I can just watch the short ad video then I can get back to enjoying my music time.  But I can't play the ad it just freezes my App and Takes forever to load (Which sucks a lot since I'm a music lover)  Sometimes if I'm LUCKY! (See I caps the word lucky) The ad might play, But other times it doesn't play at all which freakin' stinks!  Anyway I don't know if other people using this app experiences any problems like these (I just hope not)  -That one random person who's ranting on a app about ads. How pathetic",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app was great, we all know it.  But suddenly, out of the blue, came an update.  Because I hadn't updated the app, it was pretty glitchy. Due to that, I updated it. Now, whenever I play music and swap to another app, it crashes. The music COMPLETELY STOPS. Before the most recent update came out, it was FINE.  Because of this, I would rate it one star- but I'm not going to, because this app has great potential and on all my other devices it works quite well.  I would recommend this app, but they should really fix the bugs in the next update!!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great stations. Great variety! LOVE this app!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Desktop Spotify is great: nearly every song ever at your fingertips. Mobile Spotify is a different story. 90% of the time, I use Spotify when I'm out and can't access my computer, and the shuffle play function sets my teeth on edge. It's less shuffle and more like radio, since it throws in the occasional recommended artist here and there. The idea of going ad-free, offline functionality, and unlimited skips is plenty of incentive to buy the premium version, but the shuffle feature less makes me want to go premium and more makes me want to delete the app and possibly punch something.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I hadn't heard Barbara Mandrel in years! It's GREAT to get to hear her as much as I want now.I love the OLD country music myself.Conway.Merle etc.Thx Spotify,Your're the BEST! CAROL",Spotify(3)

Positive,Great app________ love it,Spotify(3)
Positive,It's a great way of listening to music,Spotify(3)
Positive,"We have premium, so no ads, and can play songs in any order we want. My husband, kids and teenager, and I all have our own playlists and can listen on any device, even at the same time, on the same account. We use the 'listen offline' option all the time! No internet, no problem! However, you can't set parental controls, which means the teenager has to be careful, otherwise the younger kids get explicit music showing up in their feed. I think if we paid $5 more we could have individual accounts for family members? Anyway, its a great app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"At first this app worked great in my office at work for several weeks. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, it can't get through a single song without skipping or dropping the song. I tried adjusting the settings. This did not help. I also tried downloading the songs to my device. This seemed to help slightly, but songs are still skipping or failing to play. It doesn't seem to be a problem with my network as other streaming apps (I.e. Pandora) seem to be working just fine. I'm about to drop my spotlight premium subscription if this issue is not resolved",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Well sometimes I will go on it and it never loads. What I mean by this is that I only get a gray screen . Also sometimes there are ads that I Don't mind but they pause and can't play so This means no music . Now back to that gray screen . . . I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all . If you like rock like me then listen to linkin park (in the end , numb,and no more sorrow ) you also need to listen to headstrong . These songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock .",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love streaming music. Every album I've wanted to listen to is there. I get the premium update when I know I'll have more time for music and cancel it easily when I don't. I try all kinds of music because there's no risk. No one likes buying a disc they end up not wanting. Spotify has an excellent variety of music.  There's no need to store things. It's great for people who don't have tons of space for CD towers. I am in my mid 50's and find that this is easy to use. It's not just for millennials.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Unless you have premium, it kinda sucks because you can't listen to songs on demand; only shuffle. But rather than that, it's a great app! Easy setup,",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is literally the only app that you can listen to any music you want for free. It's beautiful, chic and it has great sound quality.  ignore old review of this, it now allows you to listen to any of their music for completely free. You still have ads, but they're not very common. Also it's has great connection to social media and it even outlets to shazam so you can find the song you want and listen to it automatically.  Save your troubles with any other music app this is the best decision you'll ever make.",Spotify(3)
Positive,I can't find fault with this app. It's excellent. I love music and spotify is a dream come true for music lovers. Every artist and every song I look for I find. Keep up the great work spotify,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is amazing, except for the fact that every time I open it, it says there's no internet connection, when there CLEARLY is. Because of this, I have had to (for the past two weeks) delete the app almost daily (1-2 times) and redownload it. It frustrates me how slow it is sometimes and I am contemplating on whether I should delete Spotify for good. On the other hand, I use it every time I use my tablet (it's great to use while getting ready!) I enjoy that you can make playlists, follow them, save songs, etc. I would recommend this app to anyone who enjoys listening to music frequently, but be aware if it says there's no internet connection. I don't know if it's just my tablet or not, to be honest. _",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I got Spotify a couple years ago. I do not have Premium, (for those of you who don't know what that is, it is the version of Spotify that you pay for.) However even without Premium, Spotify is an all around amazing music app! I have never really had any trouble with it, and it plays all of my music like a breeze. I happen to have gotten Spotify when it wasn't really a big music app, and even then it worked great! It updates every now and then and makes it better pretty much every time. I would highly recommend this incredible app, especially to music lovers that just need a good music app. It has a lot of features including, following music artists, creating your own playlists, picking who you want to listen to, and you can also go to the ""Browse"" section and from there pick from a lot of genres and even sleeping sounds to help you sleep. There are radio stations to listen to as well. Great app! I would say the best ages that should get this app are, 11 and up. Depending. I love Spotify and if you get it, (which you should) then you will too! Thank you for reading this I hope I helped you make a decision on whether or not to get this amazing app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,This is a great app. The only problem I have is that it is not very self-explanatory. If you are not app savvy it is somewhat confusing. But the music selections are awesome.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app is great but my favorite artist was taken down, like all of her good country songs and now they only have her stupid pop songs. I need my Taylor swift back!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great the best,Spotify(3)
Positive,"GREAT if you don't mind NOT choosing your own songs even ones you own. I find it annoying that you can't play a specific song unless you have a one song playlist and even then you get the crummy suggestion.  I like Pandora better personally. I can at least listen to the one song I want to hear or someone else hear without issue. Spotify on the pc is the way to go.  $10 a month premium is just too much would rather watch movies for that kind of money.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Love Love LOVE THIS APP !!! All the had music you. Could  ask for ... As a music Lover the greatest music app I've ever tried! I would definitely recommend this app for all music lovers and enjoyers! Thank you so much Spotify, your the music God savior yo!",Spotify(3)

Positive,Great music and I enjoy every minute,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify was a good music app when it first appeared but has grown better and better! The clincher for me was the ability to download my favorite songs and playlist to my various platforms, phone, tablet, ereader, computer and iTouch. Wireless or phone data signal is not always available and knowing that I can still listen to the music that I want is very important to me. Way to go Spotify, keep up the great work!",Spotify(3)

I did not know what it was called I did not ask my cousin for the name I got the name bye her saying to her mom spotify is great and when I went to find out what the name was by looking for a music app and I am happy now.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great free music and podcasts. Spotify does have a no add premium option for a monthly cost but I don't mind the ads for free music I can choose. Huge variety, categories and specialized mood/activity lists. Good way to keep up on the new and upcoming artists. Also fun to check out unexplored genres and podcasts. Overall great service!",Spotify(3)
Positive,It used to be great but it's getting more and more restricted. The app won't let you connect to external speakers without paying which seems unfair. I'd rather just use Pandora.,Spotify(3)
Positive,great app!!!! i loved it but it suddenly started saying that i cant listen to my already downloaded music until i got premium and it wont let me get premium,Spotify(3)
Positive,"An amazing music experience, and great to see it on the Amazon Appstore. Love it on my Intel Atom Android tablet, be sure to enable highest quality audio streaming in settings.",Spotify(3)

Positive,Pretty nice to have. Has a great variation of songs and nice songs just in general.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"The app is great because the concept of music streaming is great. The only thing I wish the app did is something the PC does- see what friends are listening to. If the app had a page for keeping up with friends and seeing their current listening, I'd easily consider this a 5 star app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is a great ideia, you can listen all your music without concern to lose àlbuns or not have this album close to you",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Love this app. Very easy to use, can choose what I like to listen and do it off line. It's great I do recommend it.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotlight is great because you don't have to pay anything and they have a huge selection of songs for any listener.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Selection is great.More songs and the playlist is your to remember for a long time. Spotify music get five stars.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great music app. Enjoying it enough to consider upgrading to the subscription plan.,Spotify(3)
Positive,I think it is a great app so I give. A fivebstar rating but it won't let me listen to music if I don't have WiFi and I don't have a phone so I don't have WiFi everywhere.,Spotify(3)

Positive,Great app. Minimal commercials. Genres are full of great music for whatever type of mood you are in.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app but it doesnt have the newest songs like taylor swift shake it off and thats not even new any more im pretty pissed but sti its a good app needs some more work tho im ten years old yay its my birthday,Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify is a great way to listen to your favorite songs and artists with one or two ads which are like ten seconds long you can buy premium and get no ads and listen to you music offline,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Love it, works great! No issues at all. 10/10 would recomend .",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app to start with. Nice tease then after 6 months you have to pay to have &#34;premium membership&#34; to listen to your own music. Going back to my i-Pod this app is NOT free!!!!!,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app. It has all the music I could possibly want. Well worth paying a little extra to get the premium stuff,Spotify(3)
Positive,Ok I got it yesterday and it worked great but now it keeps kicking me off when I try to use it,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Was working great with the exception of the ads But now you must purchase Premium to select the specific song you wanna which is completely unfair and unnecessary",Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify was doing great until there latest update on 9/10/15 they completely wrecked it for all the people who don't have premium. I demand pure old version back!!!!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"The BEST music app I've used, by far. The only one I use for music now. Music is my life, no TV, it keeps me going, if it was an option I'd give 10 stars. Great job & thank you for allowing me to enjoy my music with this app.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Spotify is the greatest app in the history of apps.Even if you go offline, you can still listen to your saved songs.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Works great. I use Spotify mobile app on W8 phone & Kindle Fire. No issues. I heard some reviews complain abut the shuffle play being only play back option. The Spotify app does make it appear the only playback option is Shuffle Play as button is prominent on top play list, but to bypass just click on first song to start playing music and the songs will continue to play in descending order as your playlist is built. Enjoy. Now for the Amazon Fire HD music app - go back to school or at least try and mimic Spotify if you want to have any success.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"WOW! Great choices, and easy to use. Thanks",Spotify(3)
Positive,Awesome works great exceeds expectations,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I've had spotify on my kindle for the almost three years, and its been great to me the whole time: I could find just about any song I wanted, queue up my own playlist in the order I want, and listen to individual songs at my leisure. It must have happened just today because I still had all these freedoms when I was listening to my music last night, but the most recent update is upsetting, to say the least. This once wondrous app which once gave me free access to a complete library all in the order I wanted, is now as crappy as the mobile app for phones. I really loved this app before then, it was the quickest and easiest way to listen to music how I wanted, but now I can only shuffle my playlists. NOTHING ELSE. To the creators of this app, I don't think you fully realize how absolutely frustrating it is when you want nothing more than to listen to certain songs, but because of the recent update on the app you have to pray that you can find the right song in the limited number of skips the app gives you, and when you don't, you feel an empty depression form in your chest. I know the quick and easy way to solve this would be to buy spotify premium, but guess what?? Not everyone can afford to spend $24 a month+ just for music!!!! :D SO glad to see that this app is now more concerned with getting rich than the value of sharing wonderful music with everyone! I'll definitely be looking for other apps now that offer the same wide library but free access to order the songs as you wish. This app WAS great, but overnight I'm assuming some corporate bum took over and decided to rob half the world of music. Good on you, bub. :')",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Your search for a great app for music has ended! Spotify has thousands of songs to choose from. Two drawbacks is that if u have the kindle fire HD6, you won't have to web player option, that lets you choose whatever music you want just with ads. Then for the downgraded devices, you don't have web player.I just make playlists of just one song so I can listen to whatever I want though, so it's no issue for me at all. Besides that, this app is great for all the people who need to listen to music ln a daily basis. On VERY rare occasion does it crash btw.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great for anyone who loves music,Spotify(3)
Positive,lo v e spotlight. easy to use and great,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Everything Is Great! But I'm Tired Of Ads,I Don't Wanna Buy Premium Because Thats A Waste Of My Money! I Would Give This 5 Stars If I Didn't Have To Buy Premium And Have No Ads This Would Have A Million Stars",Spotify(3)
Positive,I think that it is a great music site. Its easy to work and has all new music and old music.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Works Good But Not Great,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Its great you can save and listen to your music and stuff but when I hit the little botton that says download cause I wanna download the songs it says,that it can't and my songs don't download, if you just want to listen to music this is perfect for you,but if you wanna download them then its not",Spotify(3)
Positive,Such a great app!!! I can listen to music anytime and I can listen to all my favorite songs. The only thing is I wish you can listen to it without Wi-Fi but it's still amazing!,Spotify(3)
Positive,Still learning my way around the site. Great to get the chance to listen to a wide range of music from other countries and broaden the ethnic mix I can appreciate.Brilliant.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great app, a lot of songs, easy to find and so easy to use. I love this app. Only one thing bothering me is it's often stop working after using it for five and maybe. And it often happens every single time I use it. I use this app on my fire 8 hd though. It would be great if this problem will be fixed for me me",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great for music lovers!!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great until lyrics disappeared, then for months they have strung people along, telling them they're going to fix it. They now use an outside source. You may have to pay extra for the lyrics; I don't know. Seemed like a hassle. I quit them mostly for the way they kept saying it would soon be better than ever. Bull. Felt played, myself.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"(Yes I intentionally spelled it that way) Its pretty awesome ads are not that often maybe once every 10 songs and they are either 15 or 30 seconds long. Sound quality is amazing! My only wish is I can play music without premium, so when I dont have access (wifi is needed if you dont have premium) I just use my mp3 player when I dont have wifi. Otherwise its awesome I have had playlist with over 300 songs so defiantly a lot of song space in a playlist. You can even watch the late night show with jimmy fallon so win win over all great app defiantly get it if your looking for music. Sorry for rambling on!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app. Best music app I've used.,Spotify(3)

Positive,Spotify work's great.,Spotify(3)
Positive,This great I get to choose what music I like and very easy to access.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great variety. Have had it for years.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great multi-device solution that allows playlists to work online, offline and on all devices.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify was great for tablet users. We could listen to any song and only had one ad not too often. Then they added another ad (the most annoying being for Spotify) and started playing them more often. But we put up with it because it was still free and we could still play any song. So much for that. Now we are stuck with shuffle mode. I honestly thought there was something wrong when I tried to play a song but couldn't and was dismayed to realize this was an update. Yes, I am grateful for free music and I still prefer it to Pandora because I can at least choose a playlist but this is an awful change. I have not learned to love Amazon Prime music but I guess it will have to do. Bad move, Spotify. Your service is not worth what you charge for premium and now it is not worth listening to the free service. First world problems, true, but it is a shame to ruin a perfectly good app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify is great. Here you can find so many great songs by many artists. Spotify definitely is worth every second of great music.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Was absolutely great. Now terrible and useless since the Spotify Connect forced updates. Used to be able to use Spotify app on my receiver by itself. Now HAVE TO use my phone to stream to the home theater receiver or other devices. What's the point of loading your app on my receiver if it will only work from my phone now (as of last week). It wouldn't recognize any devices - after fixing all the bugs and changing my device/receiver settings to get it to work, I realise they've turned a great app to an annoying, useless waste of space. I cancelled my Premium subscription and will uninstall the app. What a shame.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I'm originally on Google Play, which is great and easy to use. I switched to Spotify for the ease of using it with Alexa. However, Spotify is not as easy to use, frequently cuts songs off somewhere in the middle and just stops playing for no reason. I'm going back to Google Play. Google play is a better value, with YouTube red included in the subscription price.",Spotify(3)
Positive,It's Great !!! I Have Premium Its Great Just Awsome !!!!,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great for those with limited resources. Not pushy about buying into level beyond free.,Spotify(3)

Positive,Great app _______________ enough said,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Best music app out there, great. __ __",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Was getting tired of Pandora so I hopped over to Spotify. Overall, I love it! I have the ability to choose the exact songs I want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music, which, btw, is great. I can easily access songs, artists, and albums through the my music section, and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations. I have hundreds of songs which I can access anytime (as long as I have a WiFi connection) and I'm glad the music continues to play when the screen is off (I use the app on a FireHD) I do, however, have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason I am dropping the rating from five stars to four. If I am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time (it's most likely to happen while I'm on the web) the music will sometimes stop playing completely, and I have to go back to to the app and reselect the song. (Which, btw, counts as a &#34;skip&#34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough, will trigger an add) Another similar problem involves the adds themselves: Sometimes an intro to an add will play (fyi I find these intros extremely annoying and useless) and the add itself will not play, even if I choose to play it. Other times the add will just stop playing mid-way through. On both of these occasions I cannot access any music, and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program, which, when I reopen the app, I am gifted with another add. However, through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this app, and I encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try!",Spotify(3)
Positive,This is a great music app! I recimend this app to anyone! Who like apps like like Pandora or iHeartRadio,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great!!!! Only bad thing is I can't upgrade to premium,Spotify(3)
Positive,Its a great app. It has a lot of music you can't find anywhere else!!!!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I wish I had known of this sooner. I paid a lot to download Amazon Music not on Prime. My college son told me about it and he just played a single album and he wasn't familiar with other features. The radio option is great. You choose an artist or a song and Spotify will develop a station of similar music. It's instant and doesn't need to learn your preferences like at Pandora,e.g. My favorite genre of music (other than classical and Blues) is Celtic. I was disappointed when I didn't see Celtic as one of the radio choices. Then I learned about the search feature and entered a Scottish band (The Tannahil Weavers) and up comes all of the Tannies'albums; All for free! I've found out some albums that I didn't know existed. I learned of groups that I didn't known of previously. Again, all for free!!! Amazing app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,This is a great app. You can play almost ALL the newest songs. You can also listen to podcasts. The app personalizes playlist for the user as well.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"BEST SCAM EVER!!!! At first I couldn't believe people would pay for this service. Then I looked around at the examples of ineptitude around me. YES I CAN. Where to begin... First, disclaimer: I'm an audiophile. I do not get paid or profit in any way, even indirectly from any of these companies. I'm just a true music lover that happens to be logical also, and cannot stand by and watch people make a horrible mistake. So enough said... now let's get to the details. Or if not, skip to the bottom line. 1. Algorithm. Spotify is trying to do nothing else but copy the brilliant Music Genome Project (Pandora) algorithm, but fails miserably. All algorithms have to learn first, that's understandable, the problem is that there is something wrong with this algorithm, or the pool where it has to choose from is just not very good. I picked Alternative at one point, and 2 songs later Spotify shoves a New Age song at me, couple of songs after, I'm listening to Punk Rock. In short, Pandora's algorithm is certainly better, and that's an understatement. 2. GUI. Not horrible, but certainly not the best. Takes a bit to figure out where all is, and it's not automatically intuitive and at the ready. Takes you several clicks just to find where to skip the song being played. Note to developers: THIS SHOULD BE AT THE READY!!!! If it's playing, you have to give the choice to get rid of it on the fly. Minor tick on this one overall, but that skip should be nice and handy, which is a major flaw in my eyes. Nothing like being stuck or having to dig through a couple of menus just to get rid of a horrible song. 3. Paying to play owned music. This at first looked like a plus compared to Pandor, but in close analysis, it makes no sense to a logical person. While superior to Pandora in the fact you can play your own music (if you pay a monthly fee), if you own your music, why do you have to pay to listen to it AGAIN? And pay monthly????? Can someone make sense of this to me? Why are people paying for this, again???? Ridiculous. Developers: The idea to mixing streamed music as part of payment, should go hand in hand with being able to play the customer's already owned music FOR FREE!!! Otherwise, why even have this feature? Customers could just buy Poweramp, which they only have to pay for it once, for less than your monthly fee, AND has superior and more thorough features than your service. Let the people play their owned music for free. 4. Equalizer. Oh yeah, 5 bands. TOTALLY IMPRESSED. Look up Poweramp. 5. Cost. So basically, the only reason to buy this service, is to listen to new music on the fly, unlimited, right? Oh wait, the algorithm is not that good. Well, guess you will listen to music you don't like...A LOT. Oh yeah, and to boot, you want people to pay for the same thing as given by Pandora, but pay TWICE AS MUCH per month??? Did I mention this is a brilliant scam? HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE: If you want to listen to new, streamed music monthly, get Pandora (for half the price). If you want great sound quality and hands down the best music player in mobile, get Poweramp. Oh yeah, and you only have to pay once (for several devices, not just every device), and will cost you less than what you will pay in one month for Spotify.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app was great. It has anything I could want to listen to, which is cool since I like pretty much everything. But now, since the new update doesn't allow you to pick your own songs, I can't listen to it anymore. I've tried using it, but it's frustrating trying to find a specific Misfits song or something, then suddenly, I get stuck on a band I didn't even want to listen to. Until Spotify let's me pick my own stuff again, I'm deleting it",Spotify(3)
Positive,I really like that I can listen to music that I had thought was gone forever. Being able to listen to groups that I've loved in the past so great ! I also get to listen to new music that I could never afford to purchase is awesome ! Thanks for being there for me and other people .,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love this apps, I have put all the oldies that I know and love on my list and can listen to them anywhere, great apps.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Such a great app! I love this one better than all the other ones, if you pay for premium services you can listen to full albums of any artist! Thank you some much for making my work day a better one.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify has most the music that I need for my life. There may be ads but is worth it. They may not have unpopular artist but most of the artists are in spotify, and you may have to pay for offline but it's still great. So I just hope you try out spotify and enjoy (:",Spotify(3)
Positive,"With the change of apple software to focus around their own services, using my enormous collection in iTunes match just got a whole less easy on my phone. So, I looked at options and thought I'd try spotify. So far I really like it. I love hearing new stuff and the play lists are great. They have a bunch of playlists focused on work and study. I work for myself and I find myself using their playlists every day. I have an all apple home and office, but I think I'll stick with spotify rather than apple music.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"This app works great for my general listening. I do have to search a little deeply for my more obscure songs, but overall I have been able to find what I want.  In the end, if you don't want the clutter of a million discs, this is a decent alternative if you pay for the subscription.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Huge variety of music and pre-made / random playlist. Great browsing and easy to use. Love how it sync's up to almost all of my devices. Use it daily whether I'm listening to it on my Fire Tablet while reading, going jogging in the morning using it on my phone. Or even playing it on my ps4 through my T.V. while playing a game or just listening to it in the background. Offline playlist are nice for not eating up data with no wifi. Great Music App, its worth full membership for anyone who listens to music all the time in my opinion.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app is great, there are a few songs I couldn't find but overall its great. The commercials aren't all that bad. They rarely ever bother me",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great selection, love classical music. Lots of choices. And it is free. That is great.",Spotify(3)
Positive,App quality is not great. App becomes unresponsive after Minutes of playing. Can't even force close it.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great to take music on the road with you when your radio won't pick up local stations,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I absolutely love this app. I've tried many others and in my opinion, this is the best. The only problem iis that it takes up too much space in so little songs. If there is a way to fix that, I would love it. Thank you for an otherwise great app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is the best go-to music app available. I have had an account with Spotify for a few years now, and I have not been disappointed. I have discovered many great songs by artists that would never have radio play because stations play the top 20 nonstop. I have created so many playlists, and if you are a paid member you can have songs offline to listen when away from wifi and to not use data. There are also already user created playlists you can save or listen to, and I honestly use one with Native American drums to fall asleep every night! It has helped with insomnia! I also have added a family account so my kids can have their own playlists, which I can keep track of. At anytime I can add or remove songs from their lists as the primary account holder. It is a good way to give them some music freedom, without it being explicit songs I would never know about. The app itself can be used free, but with some limitations. Give the paid membership a try just once, and you'll understand. Love, love, love Spotify!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Its great how you can pick your favorites then play them and listen while using other apps!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I just recently discovered this app. It is great! You can choose any genre that you feel like listening to. You can change your mind; you can go from a station to just one artists songs. There is nothing stopping you from changing your mind as often as you like. Perhaps you'll start out with Taylor Swift, then switch to Blake Shelton, or maybe you just want to listen to RIFF. You can switch back and forth at any time. There is every kind of music you can think of .",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Very ""manual transmission"" in design. For some, this is a great thing. You control EVERYTHING about your catalog, You can choose songs or albums to save. I'm ambiguous on what ""follow""-ing an artist actually means... but whatever. For those that are stuck in automatic transmission mode (pick some thing and let it unfold how it wants), all this freedom can seem horrifying, It took me a few days to re-adapt myself to the freedom that the app offered.  No consideration is really given for what you already own. This could be frustrating if it isn't considered that a person can arbitrarily add any single track (that the service is aware of) to the person's own catalog.  For a person with a PC background, trying to add things (while the well behaved android thing runs) can be confusing/annoying. This isn't a criticism of the app, which seems to do fairly expertly what it does... But, The ""Oh, ya. There might be desktop users."" thing seems to be an afterthought. This isn't a criticism of the app itself. It can only do what it is programmed to do, But, [desktop user manipulating user's library] seems to (unfortunately) be an afterthought at best.  As to music sources, there's few things lacking as I can tell. In particular (as of this date). Yanni - Optimystique seems to be absent, and to access the songs I remember I have to use ""Winter Light"" (a newer album/rehash, or whatever). I can live with that.",Spotify(3)
Positive,I don't understand how anyone wouldn't get this. You don't even need premium (unless you want more songs). This app is great for listing to a specific song any time you want.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Works great when others dont,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is a great music app! I love how you can listen to any song on an album and download songs (premium) to listen to without using data! Great app just one issue: It just randomly pauses and when I go to look at the app the pause button isn't hit and it won't resume playing unless I hit pause and play again. Great app just had that one issue. Definitely recommend over Pandora, Slacker, iHeartRadio, etc",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great music app. Love the weekly discovery feature and the daily mixes.,Spotify(3)
Positive,It's great for people who have unlimited data.... My main issue is that there is no hotbar player for when the app is open. I don't enjoy having to go back from Silk to Spotify to skip a song. P.S: I'm using a Gen 2 Kindle Fire that was purchased in 2012.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app all good music,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify has an amazing selection, no doubt. The ability to create your own playlists, surf from one related artist or group to another (in other words, discover new music economically) by listening to the entire track, and to listen offline (Premium only (it's a coded special file, so don't think you get to keep it permanently) is truly great for the listener. However, the artists are severely underpaid. Services like this one are a slap in the face for the creative geniuses that move you emotionally. If you want to do them justice, be more than a complacent consumer and tell Spotify that you demand more support to the artists they profit from. Hold Premium hostage! Only get the free version until they change their ways!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great selection of great music,Spotify(3)
Positive,"The music is great, they have near everything. Wish you didn't have to pay to play the immediate song you wanted to instead of putting it on shuffle. Otherwise, great app that you should totally get!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify became my ""GO TO"" app for streaming music. I like the variety and flexibility. I like Spotify best when it works with my devices. It does NOT work on my Kindle Fire. I have gone to the dev sight and they do not provide for feedback which would allow them to discreetly fix issues. They do have a tab that says FEEDBACK but it is a goat rope. The app works great on my Samsung devices but it does not work on Amazon devices. Go figure.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I would have dropped out of college, fell asleep while driving, and been in severe road-rage-induced car accidents were it not for Spotify's nearly constant stream of music for me. Thank you Spotify. You're the best. Keep up the good work! Spotify also has great customer service for when you have any issues. I have been using Spotify Premium for over 4 years now. I recently had to use the free version for just a day or two while working through a problem I was having with my premium account and I realize why someone might not like it. There are definitely a lot of ads and a lot less freedom with the free version, but I believe the premium is worth it. If your'e a student anywhere, it's only $5 a month, and that's a lot less than a new CD. I love that it instantly syncs across all my devices so my playlists are with me in my car, work, my personal laptop, and even my phone. It's just great.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is great! It is almost like Pandora only you can search and pick individual songs and make your own playlists. They don't have everything but they do have a lot. Also, the recordings for some of the songs are not good at all ( piano pieces are all I have heard so far with bad recording) but I don't know if Spotify controls that or not.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Love spotify. All my favorite songs and albums at my fingertips. Really nothing bad to say about it. Its free and has ads but the ads dont bother me one ad after every few songs no big deal. Now it also lets you listen to one ad and have 30 minutes of uninterupted listening. I add my fave songs to playlists, organize playlists, and save entire albums. I just put my favorite playlist on shuffle and jam while im getting ready for work. It works great on my kindle fire. Excellent app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I would honestly give this platform five stars but, the adds are annoying. I don't want to upgrade lol. Great app though. They are always making good quality updates to music and over all stability of this app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,I really like spotify music app. Although I am relatively new to this app and will do a follow-up review once I have been using it longer. What is great so far is that the user can choose the music they want to hear! Unlike other music apps. What I am not sure of yet is can I as a mom of a pre-teen set parental controls that only I will be able to remove. There are some racy lyrics out there that I don't want my children exposed to just yet... including language or suggestive themes.so an update is in the future. As of this writing only I have used it and at that not long enough to vet it..,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Comparing Spotify to what I consider its main competitor, Apple Music, there's really no clear winner. Both services have comparably sized music libraries, and each one has plenty of content that you won't find on the other. They're about the same price and have similar features such as radio stations (although Apple Music has stations with DJs if that's something you care about), hi-fi streaming, commercial free streaming, and so on. Apple Music's library appeals more to me personally, but the client absolutely does not.  The iTunes desktop client for Windows is nothing short of horrific, and they're pretty much equally inconvenient to use on Linux. I've found that they work about equally as well on OS X. You can login to Spotify on as many devices as you'd like, where Apple Music can only be authorized on six devices at once. You can't stream from multiple devices at once with either service. The Android clients for both services are great, although buffering time occasionally seems a bit longer than necessary on Apple Music. Obscure music is equally sparse on both services, but different bands are available for streaming on each of them, so it's worth looking into what they offer. I ultimately switched from Spotify to Apple Music because of that.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"They have great music and most of my favorite songs, I recently figured out that they don't have all of the panic! at the disco songs, and not all of a lot of other bands songs, I think they should work on getting all of a bands songs and not just half of them. Be sides that it is a great app",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great love the songs ________________________#Famous #Kanye West  Love #Sit still look pretty #Daya",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Could use a bit more variety with the ads. I don't mind ads, but I'd rather not hear the same ones over and over again. Lots of great music, and good playlists from Spotify.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I finally got this app to work on my new phone!! Previously I was unable to log-in and after repeated requests to reset my password, with the links never working, it seems there may have been some compatibility issue with my old phone. I've been doing a lot of song/artist searches and this is a bit annoying since I can't immediately tell if a song is legit or a cover till I download it. So a lot of deleting is going on. I'm also finding that the search engine is poorly designed since I can input a name or title and I may or may not find what I'm looking for. Very inconsistent. But, that being said, I still give this 4 stars since it's a great way to find new and old music and add to my library.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is an amazing app if you are wanting to listen to music. You can set up your own playlists and organize them the way you please or listen to playlists Spotify has already created! They can give you song choices from songs you already listen to too, but! There's a tiny but. (haha) On most mobile devices, you can only listen to the music on shuffle, which is great when you don't know which song to choose or you just want to listen to it all, but it's not when there's one in particular that you want to hear. Other than that, amazing music app. So thankful I got it, it's helped me find some new amazing music that has become my favorite __",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is a really great Spotify app for Kindle Fire that is even better than the web app in my opinion. You can easily access all of your options, and it plays clearly with very few issues. One of the issues is that if you have to pause your song for a little while, you often times come back to the app saying you are not connected online. I always check and am always connected. Clicking back until it kicks you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track. Also sometimes when playing for a long period of time, you will occasionally come across a song that will be buffering and will not play. I tend to just go back to my playlist or songlist and try another song. Other than that, I really like the app, and I find it to be the best out of all of the music apps (Pandora, IHeartRadio, etc.) out there.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love my spotify. I have the free version. I use it primarily when I'm working on my computer for music background or working out or working. When you get to listen to your own personal selection of music, you don't have to worry about turning the channel, or hoping the next song is better. They are all great songs, because it's your selection. You can make different lists too, which makes it even more customized for what you are doing and what you want to listen to while your are doing it.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I can safely say that Spotify is the greatest, most joy-inducing invention of the 21st century. I play music CONSTANTLY and Spotify can satisfy your every need with a mere click of a button, from Yo-Yo Ma and Mozart to 60s folk to modern electronica... The premium version is the best $10 a month I can possibly spend. I wish I had a dollar for all the money I spent on cassettes and CDs back in the day, whew... I use this gloriois app, new releases to me within minutes of release, and member all the weeks waiting for CDs from the BMG CD club!!! Modern marvel...",Spotify(3)
Positive,"As someone who grew up wth lovers of music in a house with music always playing, two sngers and even a tour manager for a great Indie/Folk musician in my family, I am so blessed to have been around every kind of music from every decade of the 20th and now 21st centuries (plus a love of Classical, film scores, Broadway standards, you name it. Spotify helps me access pretty much anything I am in the mood for. I have never searched for an artist or song and not found it in Spotify. It really is the coolest site. The App is great too, very easy to use, and I even discover new music here. Try it, I can't think of an problems or even disappointments, and have been a happy fan, especially in the lastt few years. IF you tried Spotify when it first was popping up on Facebook, and found it confusing (i did, but can't remember why, it has been been a while), I encourage you to give it another go. Everything is organized and user friendly, you can follow friends &learn about new - or just new to you- songs. My 78 year old Dad LOVES this App (he has a vinyl collection to die for, early Rock from the people who truly were the pioneers. And Spotify has it, they have the 1970s stuff my Mom digs and new discoveries she hears in radio. I only wish my music LOVING Grandmothers were around still, they both loved music so much. So yep, 5 stars from me, and my adventures into more than 80s music :( Which they also do have. __ the best ""Time Machine"") Sorry to gush, but I'm really happy to write about something Positive! Download and HAVE FUN!! :0)",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is my favorite music app by far. It's great for playing almost anything you can think of. You can search by song, album, or artist. You can also search playlists that other users have created, or make your own. The discovery features are pretty ample. Spotify makes it's own suggestions, and there are several add-ons (last.fm, Hype Machine, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone Recommends, etc.) that also give great suggestions based on your listening habits or what's new and popular. The social element is also fun. You can follow other users (including artists) and see what they're listening to, and share songs and playlists. I pay for Spotify premium because I like having offline access and no ads!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"i like Spotify a lot - BUT - it has a lot of glitches. When i'm putting songs into categories or playlists, sometimes it switches to the Playlist i'm working on - if i stay on it a second too long. THEN when i go back to the Song List - it jumps up to the top of it (to the A's) and i have to find where i was before. This happens a LOT and it's VERY annoying.  I have found many 'songs' on Spotify that i have been looking for for a long time - so that is Great!! The Classical lists are very good as i have found Augustin Hadelich whom i absolutely love. It has music from the early 1900's - the 20's, 30's, 40's. i have found most of the music i really love - BUT i can't find any good stuff of Bob Seger's or solo by Eric Burdon which he has done lately. i am frustrated over that.  Spotify sound is fantastic even on my Macbook and iPhone regular speakers.  I am really looking forward to getting the glitches fixed - and i still love iTunes (i'm sentimental :)",Spotify(3)
Positive,I have this APP on my ipphone and it works great. but it will not install on my kindle fire. i hope there isnt a compatibility issue between spotify and kindles,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is new to me and I have found it to be pretty cool. A nice feature being that you can keep it playing while reading or other apps. are going on your Kindle. Great streaming service and a good way to check out new albums before you purchase them on Amazon or other places. It is a free app. , so give it a shot! I find the search feature best.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Music streaming websites offer the basic functions for easily accessing music, and out of all of them, Spotify is one of the top competitors. The company goes above and beyond to cater to their clientsÍ musical needs by providing a wide selection of music, creating personalized playlists and notifying them of recent activities for their favorite artists. These advantages not only allow a user to discover new music based on their personal taste but also gives a quick shortcut to make it convenient for them. With the regular updates on artists recent activities users are able to listen to their newest tracks as soon as they are released or even have the opportunity to attend their latest show. As far as the search goes for the best compatibility between a music streaming service and music lovers, Spotify is a great service to try out, especially since they do offer free trials.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I found this app on a vacation in France, after Pandora told me I couldn't use out in Europe. Unlike leading music apps/radios, you can create playlists, listen to already made playlists, or, my favorite, just search up particular songs, artists, or genres. Usually, on Pandora our iHeart radio, you just listen to whatever is on a certain radio of your choice. After using this app, I have found absolutely every song I've looked for but one. It works great, but like all others, needs Wi-Fi or cell service. But it's still totally worth it. 5 stars!!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Love this app. I have tried different music apps, but this is user friendly in my book, and can download, so can be offline and listen anywhere. Has a huge selection of music, which is great, since I listen a lot to german music, and no problem finding it.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is a fantastic service with great music content. I have used it for about 2-3 years now and recently i have upgraded to premium to take away the ads (which are always funny and interesting) the only problem i have ever had with it is sometimes if you have your library saved offline to your phone it will un install all the songs forcing you to redownload them. Now this may only be a bug, and it has only happened to me twice in the past 6 months but it is kind of a pain. If they patch that bug then i will gladly give a 5 start review.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I created a calm jazz playlist last night, and fell asleep to it. Beautiful!! My son and daughter used Spotify to create the playlist for their sister's wedding. We linked it to our Church's PA and voila! Beautiful wedding. Great product!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify sleeping music choices are amazing, and have a better selection than all of the sound machines I have ever owned. The other music and video shorts are great as well. The navigation setup is easy, and it all interfaces well with my Samsung, whi h is unusual. I am not inthe iworld, and often let down by the &#34;made for android&#34; apps. This was NOT disappointment. :)",Spotify(3)
Positive,"The great thing about Spotify is that you can play it on multiple devices, create playlists, easily find artists you like, or listen to curations / playlists put together by others. One of the best players around if you are an audiophile.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Like most of these type of apps the free version is great as long as you have Wi-Fi, but I live in the rurals and am often in areas wIth no connection. Then the app is useless, as well as at work, which is a government secured Wi-Fi, again useless. If I want to use offline I have to pay $10 per month, that's $120 a year. I'm already paying for Prime and I get free movies, t.v., books, and shipping as well as the music for $99 a year. So, why would I pay for this or anyone for that matter?",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify let's me go quickly to all my favorite songs and artists. You can create playlists that you can easily get to. You can't listen to music on the go with connection but, you can simply download it on Spotify to let you listen. I enjoy skating and dancing to Spotify. It's simply a great app you must get it.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"It is a great app. Has great tunes. And if you pay the subscription fee you have as many skips as you like, no commercials and you can download tunes, albums and playlists. They have a wide variety of albums .",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love Spotify Music. You can pick the tunes you like, unlike Pandora. I just have the free kind, but I am going to pony up to premium so I can listen offline too. Try it, you've got nothing to lose and great music to listen to.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Alongside with the Spotify Premium service ($10/mo.), this app compliments to the smart music lover who subscribes to the Spotify Premium service who loves to take his/her music on the go with synchronisation features for offline play for playlists. I listen to music using Spotify over other music players on my device and my playlists customised with a lot of songs on it have been downloaded so that I can just bring my phone and go listen in my car or just while I'm out there.  Great for the music listener and best for those who are also subscribed to Spotify Premium!",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Overall it is an amazing program. I would say that it is the best of its kind. The most annoying part of it for me is that I think that they play more advertisements than necessary. I know the advertisements are in part to support all of us who listen for free, but it still seems like they play more than they need too. Usually I use it on my kindle and this brings me to my biggest problem with it. If you have the program open in the background while reading sometimes the music will just stop after the advertisement plays. Then use have to open Spotify back up and restart the player this can be incredibly annoying. Sometimes i will have to do it every 10 minutes.  Now that i gave the bad I will let you in on the good. Spotify has an incredible library of music to listen to and it spans across all genres. To go even further though they have full discography's of all sorts of Indie/Underground bands that you may have never heard of. Spotify is a great program and I truly believe that any music fan would love it so give it a try. Now i know that this review may seem Negative, but I just want to add its only program I will use for music like this. I wanted to give it 4 in a half stars but since i couldn't I gave it 5 because it is way closer to 5 stars than 4. Please give it a try!",Spotify(3)

Positive,great FREE service. I withheld two stars as they don't offer any contemporary Christian music selections. GREAT 70's music available! The commercials are a bit annoying but for free can put up with them. I didn't like it well enough to upgrade to the paid version just to get rid of the commercials.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love hearing music, whether I'm relaxing at home or working out, The problem with other music apps: 1. You can't really choose the songs you want to listen to 2. Even if you chose a specific station the music is way off 3. Once you start liking songs, you only hear the same ones every time (Pandora mainly)  With Spotify! 1. You can look up songs: can find entire albums to listen 2. Make your OWN Playlist that will shuffle 3. Less advertising (up to 30 minutes of no ads)! 4. Customizable but with variety- no more same old songs playing on repeat.  If that's not great already their premium is a but pricy $10/month but completely worth it! (You can try their free trial and see what works for you!)  Love this app I have no idea why I didn't find it sooner! Plus you can download the app for free now on tablets and smart phones (not sure if it's always been that way though lol)",Spotify(3)
Positive,"What is there to say? Spotify on the Amazon Kindle Fire simply works. And it works as it should be. No problems, no hiccups. I love the way to use it as a remote when playing Spotify also on my computer or television. But most of all, it just has my music where I want it. And this app is simple to use, responsive. It should not trying to do more than that - which is what makes it a great app for me.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"It doesn't deserve 3 stars, more like 2.5. Spotify is great for free. You get what you pay for. There is an advertisement before the play list is executed and after the second song.

Like I said, you get what you pay for.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"will never go back to Pandora I Have a list of 3000 songs put it on random everything from metallica to Madonna pat benitar to pato Banton have a live music list, reggae list, 80s new wave list, I even have a list of my top 50 or so songs and only allow myself that list if I am exercising,, free is great",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great for discovering new music. Does have ads but they are not overwhelming.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great for listening to a whole album! If you are from the 90s generation or earlier, you remember the significance of the cadence of songs and the intended flow of music. I find my new bands with Pandora, and establish my favorites with Spotify. After that, I DOWNLOAD THE REAL ALBUM! Music is important, so pay the artist.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love Spotify actually. Its easy to use, has cute designs and very easy to find new music. You can even create play lists which is cool. The ONLY problem I have with it is that sometimes it says ""Wait 30 min for the next ad"" and then next song I play there's and Ad. But beside that first world problem, Its great!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify can be great if on Android devices it didn't pause 10 seconds before the song was over for a few seconds and then continue to play! Also, when you listen to the ad for 30 million minutes of ad free minute I always get 2-4 adds before my 39 minutes are over!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Being from Europe and like German, Italian and French music. This is the greatest music station ever. You can build your own radio, 1000's of German albums and from over every country in the world. If you classical fantastic. I also love 60's music form America. You will love this station. I promise it. 7 days are free, or you can pay 3.99 this is word it. It is a great company.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love it! It makes daily mixes with new songs you haven't heard, basically recommendations, and I have never been recommended one sing I didn't like!

I love everything about it and have nothing bad to say except I can't stop using it now!",Spotify(3)

However, for some reason my Spotify has a glitch and it won't work for hours or even days at a time! It says I don't have internet connection, but I know I do because my internet works and any other games or apps I have that need internet access to works, even when this isn't. Also, there are other peoples in my house with Spotify, and it works well with them - except for a minor glitch such as mine. But besides that, it's a great app, and I think it is better than Pandora or I Heart Radio. Just giving my opinion. Thank you.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I have always loved Spotify! It's free and offers the best quality music you can hear, because it only has the album versions. And even if there's advertisements here and there I don't mind, but I honestly plan on getting premium soon so I can have music offline too. Aside from the great music, and easy to use interface, you can also make your own personal playlists to listen to anytime you want! And if making a playlist isn't your thing, you can start a radio station based on one song or artist, and Spotify will play you songs that are similar or related. All in all it is the best free app out there for music.  I highly recommend Spotify to anyone!",Spotify(3)

Positive,"I use this app ALL the time, and I love it. But, now I have only one problem. My Spotify updated, and now I have to listen to everything on shuffle. Now, I don't have premium, so when I skip lots of songs, there are lots of ads. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but it sucks. Oh, you want to listen to Girls & Boys (or any song)? Shuffle. Search for a song you need to add to your music? Shuffle! Now, aside from this minor difficulty, the app is the best thing. Great work Spotify!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Has been getting better and better over the years. Great plan for family at the right price. Synching offline to be able to listen to music in planes: works well and offline storage remains on SD card. Not a problem anymore.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is a great music streaming app, I actually prefer it to Pandora for the reason that I have more control over exactly what artists play on my stations. I would highly recommend this app!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is great on tablets and computers because you can play whatever you want just for ads, but on a phone its still good but not free for everything (which is understandable. I love it more than amazon music because it has a larger variety of songs AND talk shows.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love it. As a classical music lover, Spotify has all of the great classical labels.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Enjoying this so far, accessible playlists are great for me as I find I have less time to create my own. Thanks to all the users curating great playlists on here, you are my heroes and you make the platform what it is.",Spotify(3)
Positive,10/10 great,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Full version of the app is great, but the functionality with Apple CarPlay frankly sucks.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Not used much yet, but highly recommended by a Friend that is an I.T. SPECIALIST & their kids. So will try since I love ALL my music except RAP. Great to have such a collection...old tunes, tunes grew up to 80-90's, country, classical, blues & jazz, Christian, & All the NEW. Try it & if not for you..you can uninstall_No commitment____",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I use spotify all the time, especially when I'm studying. I always am happy with the music it suggests and I feel that it does a lot better job of guessing what kind of music I like to listen to than Pandora and other music apps. It kinda sucks that you have to get premium which is about twenty bucks a month to turn off ads and to download music off of the app, but that's about the same price other music apps charge and with spotify you get some extra perks for your money. Great app overall.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I have downloaded this app 5 times. When it opens, all it says is ""Internal Error"" that I may not have a strong enough signal, but that does not appear th o be the problem. Heard this is a great app and want to use it, but right now, I'm not impressed.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great App. Have access to my own music and some great playlists. Even free with the ads isn't bad.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"wished I would have know earlier about Spotify, its great. If you love music its a must have. Easy too!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"great catalog on music I have rare old guitarist you can not find somewhere else.on my play list thank you gor your service",Spotify(3)
Positive,Large selection of music.I do the free version.Its great making your own play list,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love using Spotify. It has nearly all the music I want. The free version does have ads, but I don't mind them so much. Although, recently the video ads have not been working, so I get stuck on the ad and can't move on to a different song. Other than that, Spotify is great!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great choices in music! I am a jazz aficionado, and this app gives me the best choices of music. I love it!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app is great! It's better than Pandora.  Larry",Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify has all the songs witch is awesome. It has every genre of music that you can think of and has the greatest songs. Also spot if uhh is cheap and has great deals. The moment that I got spotlight I got rid of all my of music apps. It's awesome how when I am on the road I can have downloaded music that I can listen to unlike Pandora. Spotify has songs on there that haven't even come out yet. You can listen to it on different devises when ever you want.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Love this app for music . Daly mix is great. Great for podcast aslo.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Good selection of music from jazz to rap to big band. Great for dancing in the kitchen or listening to movie soundtracks.,Spotify(3)
Positive,This is a great item. Easy to use with great selection of music,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Music was great had everything I wanted. At one point I was able to log on to my account on my smart TV, and my tablet and play from there. I am giving 2 stars because I was no longer able to sign on through my smart TV or my tablet and there was no customer service available to help fix the problem. Therefore it was useless to me...",Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify perfect for every song you could think of. Spotify.Com is the very best of the best here on Amazon.Com. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great sale here on Amazon.Com Best of the Best,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great music app. I have the upgraded version and it's worth the $10 a month. Commercial free music, ability to save music off line and create custom playlists, all make this the only app I will ever need for music!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I really enjoy this app,lots to choose from,not just music, you have poetry,podcasts. I have great poetry from Langston Hugh's,from Nikki Giovanni,to Gwendolyn Brooks and thier reciting thier poetry and stories in thier own voices,great such and of course the great music! Thanks Spotify you rock!!!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Favorite app, love how it is customizable and has a great selection of music. My go to app!",Spotify(3)
Positive,I recommend Spotify to everyone! This is the best $10 I spend every month. It has almost everything from your local band that has 7 people go to their shows to the big boys. And you can listen to radio (with no ads all the skips you want) to find new music. It's really turned up my music game. I love New music Tuesday s my whole office listens to it then talks about it. Great bonding at the office.,Spotify(3)
Positive,I just use Spotify Free but I like it a lot . It's a great place for finding those old songs that you haven't heard in years as well as the newest music out there. You can save your playlist to your computer to play while online. If you go with Premium you can take some of your music with you and play it offline on your portable devices. It's a great music site.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"My dad got me premium, and I've been using it for over a year! Works great, took a while to get used to when I first switched from amazon prime, but other then that, it really works!",Spotify(3)
Positive,I love this app it is such a great app I use it every day,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is a great program for multiple reasons. One of them, it's free. Another, you don't have to have it open to listen to music. I definitely recommend it, it's a great program.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify's great...but, then again, you already knew that.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Why did I wait so long to try Spotify? The current 99 cents for 3 months deal pushed me over the edge. I may not be able to look back. The app works great on my Android phone and Kindle. But where it really shines is on my Echo.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is the greatest thing ever.i don't buy music any more. I use it at work home and in my car. I use premium, no commercial,plays what ever I feel like and when my selection is over it continues playing based on what I was listening to.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Its a great app for free music you have to pay if you want to use it offline but I love how I can connect it to other devices and control it from my kindle.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is a music app that lets you can make custom music playlists for you to listen to.but there's one issue...you need wifi to use it!you need to get premium membership to download the music and listen to it anywhere.besides that,it's a great app.I highly suggest it.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"It's great that this app is free! Gives access to pretty much any song you'd want to listen to; with that said I did the free trial with the Premium account and haven't looked back. I use it every day on all my devices and absolutely love it. The ""recommended for you"" and ""discover"" features are also great",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Love that I can add all the music I want to a playlist of my own creation, or choose to listen to an already made playlist. Its a great way to be introduced to new music/artists. When listening any where else but your computer, playlist can only be listened to with shuffle. This works perfect for me, its what I end up doing anyway.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great app. It plays music from many different artists with good audio. The only reason I didn't rate this five stars is because they don't have certain artists, probably the most popular one Taylor Swift. That's too bad, since this is a great app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is wonderful, I pay the $10 subscription and now my cell phone is my music collection. plugs into my car and home stereo via bluetooth. You can follow a muse and pick an artist you've liked in the past and see the body of their work. I re-discovered Electric Light Orchestra ELO lots of fun to listen. And now to Classical music is unlimited, hearing Composers I never heard before. Great.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Large music library. Love that it makes daily mix playlists based off of what I listen to. Radio stations are great too. I have premium and I think it's worth it.,Spotify(3)
Positive,It's Great! We love having a musical variety without commercials we simply pay for Spotify Plus for a month or two and build up our libraries and download the music and discontinue the Spotify plus until we're ready to download more music it's a great product and we're glad we switched to Spotify versus Pandora.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH, I LITERALLY HAVE 7 PLAYLISTS AND EACH HAVE OVER 100 SONGS. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE, THE MUSIC QUALITY IS GREAT, THE DOWNLOADING SPEED IS FANTASTIC AND ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT______",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Awesome update to an already great music app, I just wish it had already updated itself. #Spotify RULEZ #Love it",Spotify(3)
Positive,"So many playlists to match your mood snd what you are doing. Sound quality is great and it includes ads that when watched allow 30 minutes of ad free music ____ Almost all songs available plus acoustic and remix versions. If you have a favorite artist, they even have artist radios that you can listen too. STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,This free app works great and the music on Spotify is also very good.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify has all the music you could ever want! Great selections. Great personalized playlists!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I like Spotify as a way to hear my favorite songs on a playlist. The only problem I have with the app is there is no ""back"" key to get out of a dialogue link I don't want or accidentally got. Also, it would be a great help if the app had a ""directions for this page"" pull-down menu. Otherwise, once I learn the ins and outs, I think it will be a great addition.",Spotify(3)
Positive,The basic non-pay service offers quite a selection of music and we're having fun building our own custom playlists. Great music offered. We did purchase a blue tooth speaker for the house and are enjoying music that we love without having to change CDs or search for an additional channel since we have already build our playlists. Great service.,Spotify(3)
Positive,I love spotify. They usually have all the songs I want and if they don't have some there's tons of other songs to listen to. This app is great form it you wanna use another app but still listen to your music. I love listening to my music when I'm playing a game or cleaning.,Spotify(3)
Positive,It vworks great on my kindle love it I have it on my cellphone also LG Phoenix,Spotify(3)
Positive,I've used all the music apps you can think of and this is by far my favorite user friendly app. Has everything you could want and great for sharing with friends. I honestly think it's one of the greatest inventions of all time. Thanks Spotify!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great Awesome!  This is the best app ever!! I can't recommend Spotify enough. If I could give it 100 stars I would. With headphones the acoustics is awesome on my Kindle Fire HD. I can locate any song ever played and at it to my play list! The app doesn't drain the battery, user friendly:), and have very little if any commercials. I have tried quite a few music apps but after finding this gem I deleted all of the others. I play one song of my favorite artist/group and Spotify continues on with the songs from the same group/singer.  Thanks Spotify!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is a great app, it plays a lot of good songs and you can choose your favorite artist and I haven't run into anything I've got to buy. Plus, once you make a playlist, you can skip as many times as you want and play that song over and over again. __ Great App!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is a great app, even the free version. I've set up several categories, one for Bozz Scaggs, one for Sam Smith, one for Steely Dan, one for individual tracks or particular albums. It's a great, carefree app. There are a few ads with the free version, but so far they don't bother me. They do have a service without ads for a monthly fee, for those who prefer it.",Spotify(3)
Positive,This app is so great! You can all the songs you love from Twenty one pilots to Sam Hunt! You can make your own playlist and pick songs that you love! This app is always satisfactory to me.__,Spotify(3)

Positive,"U should definietly get Spotify!!! Its an awesome app! U can listen to music wherever u go, u can make ur own playlists, and u can have followers!!! There's only 1 bad thing.... Adds... You will be listening to ur fav songs, and then BOOM an advertisement add will skrew up ur music!!!! If ur on a different app u have to go back and fix it!!!!________________ otherwise, its a great app and u should get it!!!__________",Spotify(3)
Positive,It works great on my kindle,Spotify(3)
Positive,"baboon music, great.",Spotify(3)
Positive,What bad things could I find to say about spotify? I love all the different playlists it comes up with. I love I can mark a song I like and it's saved to a separate playlist. And the discover weekly is great as well.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Still working great for my BlackBerry Passport. Recently updated the app and still my music companion. Just this app is a battery hog. Keep your phone on plug when using spotify.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Easy to navigate and great selection and sound!,Spotify(3)
Positive,This is the best app ever! Music that I want to hear when I want to hear it! And they offer two choices of payment--a short ad every three or four songs like radio or $9+ a month for no ads. So far I've found every song I've looked for. Thanks for a great app and a great service.,Spotify(3)
Positive,great place to listen to any music under the Sun Or Moon!,Spotify(3)
Positive,This app is so great. They got Taylor Swift back which is awesome.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app is great for Kindle! I love how when you close the app it still plays music, and it's even better because it is free! I can get tons of music to listen to without paying for it. I am only giving it four stars though, because at first I thought it was really confusing to use. Other than that, it is great! __",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Not only does this find thes song searched for, it finds every version of it. Thats great when you have time to review each version and select it into your playlist. In a party situation its too easy to put the wrong version into the queue. This is my only criticism . Its an excellent app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify has a great selection of music and spoken word works. It's not just an app for listening to music but also has audio books, selections to learn different languages, and stories among other stuff. There is something for everyone and it is simple and easy to use. My only complaint is that when listening on my kindle there is no back button in the drop down bar at the top. When you are in another app and want to go back you have to reopen spotify to do so.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app is great with bunches and bunches of playlists picked by Spotify and some from other people, tons of artists, and not just the ones that are popular right nowor even in this country. Its especially cool because, at least on my version of one of the newer kindles, music from YouTube won't stay playing in another tab or when in an app, but Spotify will.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I was very skeptical at first, I mean... Free music, really? But it's great! You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it's totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!",Spotify(3)
Positive,I have more control over my music compared to the rest. I've built great playlists i can download. Awesome selection of new artists/music.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"For the relatively small price of a basic subscription, the options of downloading REALLY great music to your phone to stream no matter where you are and unlimited skips, this service is a steal. However, the unexpected stops while streaming data free can be frustrating, though it is more likely a glitch with the app than the service itself. Apart from that, I love it!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great option to Amazon prime music, nice app. We love and use Prime and also Spotify for stuff Prime has not available free. Louder too than Prime. We got the trial subscription for $1/3 months and $7 / mo thereafter. worth it.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love to use Spotify on my computer, and now it's FREE for tablet! I AM SO HAPPY! Who needs premium now? Not Me! Spotify is amazing, it even has stand up comedy recordings like Bill Cosby. I wish I could rate it more stars! Anyone who loves music should download this app immediately! PARENTS CAUTION! Spotify does have some explicit content that can not be monitored unless the album cover warns you. So I recommend listening to your child's music before letting them! Great app it is THE BEST! :)",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I downloaded this app about 6 months ago and I immediately bought the premium version. It has nearly every artist and song (minus Taylor swift) and the new songs are released here as well. If you go premium, you can add songs to a playlist and make it offline, which downloads the songs so you can listen to them when not connected to WiFi. Also if you're in college, you get a discount on going premium. Overall this is a great music app and definitely worth your time.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Works great. One of the few apps that work fine on Amazon, I did have a problem at first with logging in, but since then I am able to log on with no problems and the sound quality is amazing from my Amazon HD 10.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great music any time you want it,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app my whole family uses it,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great way for me to listen to music on the go or at home. Has a ton of mainstream and indie music. They keep on adding new features and improvements. Can't complain about the price as I feel like I get my $$$ worth.,Spotify(3)
Positive,I really enjoy all the gems on Spotify. But some of the albums I've saved have disappeared randomly (Motorhead's last album among others). Would like to know if it's gone forever...but other than occasionally that it's a great system and app,Spotify(3)
Positive,a great app for all music lovers.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"From early Porgy and Bess, to Amazon Rainforest recordings, to latest Rhyanna, pop, to Theta brainwave enhancing recordings, have rarely not found what I'm looking for. Would like more world wide multi lingual offerings, and a senior discount! Thanks for a great product.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app. Just wish there was not a fee for no ads and music anywhere. Lots of great music and options. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the premium fee. I know they have to make money somehow. ______,Spotify(3)
Positive,Works great on my kindle fire HDX and HD 6.. I also use it on other android devices but downloaded from google play.. The app itself is easy to navigate and easy to use.. I have no issues with the app or service,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love this app! I find it great that you could literally search of almost every song and see it, and how you could go and look at any music for your mood! Although the adds are annoying(not lying, I memorized them), it doesn't come up every 3 or so songs, so I'm happy.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great music idea for on the go listening of your favoriat stations and singers. Check to see if the spotify app is compatable for your android devise.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great design. Fun. So far all the songs IÍve looked for have been here.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Its great I love it!!!!! My got to app for music!!!! But I think that it should make an update letting people like me that have a kindle. Or any phone or table or whatever. It should let us listen off of internet connection. I mean I got this app for me to listen to music. It should at least let me listen off internet connection. But in other words I highly recommend this music app!!!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"In this century CD is almost obsolete the new trend is of course digital music online or on a digital device(mp3,mp4,IPhone,IPad,tablet etc)SPOTIFY is a top shelf way of finding your favorite music it doesn't get much easier to use than this !GREAT JOB SPOTIFY May the music force be with you and I hope you live long and prosper!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is a great app but my one complaint is that when I open it, it says I am offline, but I am in my own house, and,for some reason, I am only nine but I listen to songs like Your Gonna Go Far Kid by The Offspring. :)",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app is better than Pandora. For example, you can repeat the song that your listening to, and make play lists. Spotify also has Radios with UNLIMITED skips. You can follow people on Spotify, but there is no messaging other people. So, you can repeat you favorite songs, make play lists, have radios with UNLIMITED skips, and you can follow people but no messages, now that's great deal for free!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love Spotify and its great but I have to pay for download and thought it was free but its not, please make it free.",Spotify(3)
Positive,My son downloaded Spotify Music for me - it's amazing the selection of music and the sound quality seems great. Have listened to many of my favorite songs. It's helpful to see how popular certain songs are for an artist if you want to sample some new songs and see what others like.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is a great app, although some well-known songs or albums aren't on here. But otherwise this is a perfect app!",Spotify(3)

Positive,This is a great music app. I love being able to search songs and put together my own playlists.,Spotify(3)
Positive,They have so many playlists with a variety of different types of music. I am being exposed to so many different great artist that I never knew existed. The music is awesome and the app itself is very easy to use.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is one of my favorite apps. I love/need my music, and the fact that I can play it in the background is great. However, what's not fun is the fact that I got logged out in a different country, and can't log back in. I listen to music with this app every day, and this is a pretty big deal for me. I'm still in that country, and if you could fix this, I'd give it 5 stars.",Spotify(3)
Positive,THIS IS SUCH A GREAT APP!!! I LOVE HOW IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU ADDS ALL THE TIME.,Spotify(3)
Positive,It's a great app this is child appropriate and you can make playlists. The only thing I don't like is if you don't pay for premium you can't pick your songs ____,Spotify(3)
Positive,"If you love hearing music, this is the PERFECT app for you!!! This app contains any music that you like, you can search it up, press play and done!!! This app is very easy and fun to use, but the only downside is that you have to have a specific age to use it..... other than that, this app is great! I definitely recommend it to everyone!!!!!!!______________________",Spotify(3)
Positive,"You can play whole albums from a great many artists, in a pretty much a well designed app.",Spotify(3)

Positive,THIS app is great I play my favorite songs when a play games which is AWESOME only problem is sometimes it just turns on and off sometimes but other than that GREAT APP GUYS :D,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is a great app in which you can choose what music you want to play it gives you trillions of choices on songs latest songs play station music, new songs like &#34;sorry&#34; by Justin Bieber, &#34;How deep is your love&#34; by Calvin harris , &#34;they working for it&#34; by skrillex and more &#34;a must get app from google. Get it free today ______",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app. Super easy to use and very little interruptions in the music play from ads. I would 100% recommend!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Works great! I have searched over 200 songs on Spotify and I found all but 3. I like that your music continues to play when you go into other apps and even when you turn off your device. The reason it is not 5 stars is because it stops playing randomly sometimes, and you can't play in an order you want. But other than that it is a great music app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify is a great jump if you're already enjoying Pandora. Spotify is Pandora but better.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great app! I used to blow all my cash on intunes. Not anymore!!! Spotify premium let's me take as much music I, want anywhere I want at a great monthly price. And they are adding more music as it goes! (So many of James glaway's albums) Sound quality is stellar!!!!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great variety of music, love that you can save songs and make playlists. Only Negative so far is that the ads are significantly louder than the music at least 2/3 of the time, painfully so especially if you have on headphones.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great place to listen to music.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Its super good! You can choose songs and download some and not have to use limited skips or brekad like Pandora. You also can control what your listening. I just wish their were less adds. Otherwise, great app! I strongly recommend it!",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Great, never thought I would say this but I'm starting to like it better than iheart",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I have used Spotify for a long time on my phone, tablet & computer. Its a great way to have tons of music at your fingertips without having to spend oodles of money.

Positive,Great except for not being able to move songs up or down in play lists (or see play times) from android tablets. Seems odd that these features work with my old windows 7 laptop but are not avaliable with a new tablet or phone? Would be 5 stars if I did not need to keep using my laptop to adjust my playlists:-( Amazon music play lists work fine across all my devices.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app...love the music!,Spotify(3)

Positive,"Great way to listen to music, a lot of great music choices. A little buggy at times; biggest annoyance is when the ""up next"" queue gets cleared, usually if going from one suc WiFi source to another.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"The spotify app is great for listening to music. Some of the problems I am having are that when I'm on YouTube, spotify will randomly start playing without the app being open. Also, you only get a limited amount of skips if you don't have premium, and you can't choose which song to play.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I really liked Spotify. But now it's just not keeping up. The app is great, but the content not so much.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Needs WiFi or data but other than that this is a great app. I can listen to all of my favorite music and more. I love this app. This is a must download, I am in love with this app.____",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Excellent app. I used to use songza, but it became unavailable where I live, but was happy enough to find spotify. Great variety os playlists, national or international, great sound quality, shows you what songs are in the playlist. The premium version is great also, letting you choose exactly what song you want to listen to, instead of going random on to playlist and waiting for it to show up. It also lets you mark some songs as ""available offline"", so you can listen to your favorite songs anytime at all.",Spotify(3)
Positive,You have to have internet unless you want to be a member and pay a $10 fee monthly which is not fun if you don't have a credit/debt card. But other than that this app is great I come home and get to listen to all my favorite songs.,Spotify(3)

Positive,Wow all I can say is wow I can find all the music I want I can find all the band's and all the artist I wanna listen too.I think this app is just like pandora.I got this app because I was bored because all my friends and my sister had too go to school but I was sick and I used this app for 2 whole hours and still wasn't bored.Great if you are bored so plz get this app especially good If you like music._Ù÷Û,Spotify(3)
Positive,I love this app !!! It gives me the type of music I love to hear and the variety is really awesome !!! I would recommend the app to any true music lover !!! Great app keep up the good work !!! Love it even more because it is free ;-) !!!,Spotify(3)
Positive,I am listening to music I haven't heard in years. So far it is a great memory weekend with new speakers and great sounds from the past.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This service has great potential to be amazing, but streaming music is a nightmare sometimes. Even with an excellent connection and new device, the app is obnoxiously buggy. That, and they get commercial happy if you don't make your payment. They're not even relevant commercials! Just background noise to annoy you into buying their subscription!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great! I can get music I could get on Amazon Music and iTunes. The only thing I don't like about it, is you can't choose what song you want to listen to. If you have say, 5 songs on a playlist you created, click shuffle play, you can listen to those 5 songs. Awesome. But it also plays &#34;recommended songs&#34; or songs from the album you got your chosen songs from!",Spotify(3)
Positive,I love the new interface that Spotify has designed with their mobile apps - mostly very intuitive and genuinely beautiful with their use of album art and photos in the backgrounds. The way the now playing panel appears in the notification pull down is gorgeous and rounds out a great music listening experience on my Kindle. I just wish it were caught up to whatever Amazon's security standards are because the pop up warning prior to opening it every time is a tad bit annoying.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify has tons of options, great source of music.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great for a free station, not too many or too long ads",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great for when you don't know what to listen to! Having 1000+ albums doesn't always cut it.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Got it because can't play Amazon Prime on my Blackberry. Great selection of music, well curated playlists, and easy to navigate. Winner winner chicken dinner!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love Spotify! Especially this version! The app itself has a simple layout and is easy to use. I'm still not 100% used to my kindle seeing as I am more accustomed to Apple devices, but this app is great. I love how unlike on the phone version, you can play any song at any time.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Love it. Huge selection of rock/blues and country/rock artists. Don't know about alt pop or rap/hiphop styles, but great for my tastes. 1st streaming player that doesn't buffer and stutter with my crappy low speed DSL service. If you want Spotify Pro, watch for sales/promos.",Spotify(3)
Positive,I believe this app is the best for music because it has a easy to use menu and has all the songs you want. However I downloaded this app on my galaxy s6 and I can only shuffle music. I can not choose one song I have to shuffle and hope I get lucky. I would very appreciate it if this was fixed. Otherwise it is a great app.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Listening to Spotify and getting the great little trails of music to listen. Some I have forgotten or mainly never heard. Great for working out, walking, bike riding. Justing sitting with friends in backyard. Having people ask you what are we listening to.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Tons of music, easy to use, just great.",Spotify(3)
Positive,I love Spotify Music App! I can find the artists I want to hear and listen to full songs and albums. Great for me....could be Great for you.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Fantastic Music service// with music options verying from listening directly to desired artists, or starting an artist/song/album radio and listening to accurately recommended similar artists, its a great service.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"While Spotify has great features, settings, playlists, and music you want to listen to, it does not play well with all file types, or folders. Still a good app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Love it. Don't particularly care for the ads, but it's a great way to accumulate the greatest music ever made, the 80's.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Sorry, but I don't think it's that great.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app for songs to listen to. Spotify for life.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Easy to use. Portability is great I like it,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify + Amazon Echo = frictionless musical bliss. Spotify is by far the best interface for curation and discovery. Alexa helps you enjoy all your playlists and stations without being tethered to a phone or tablet. Especially great for moms, people who paint/cook/clean/build, and for anyone who has always wanted a personal DJ.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great source for all music!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"God damn this app is great and amazing great app u gote  Going here way more music than u think __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great way to have music at fingertips.,Spotify(3)
Positive,I've used Spotify ever since it came out years ago to stream music while in the car or on my motorcycle. I rarely ever even listen to the radio anymore. The ability to custom build playlists or search through other people's playlist is awesome. Being able to follow artists' pages is great for keeping up with new releases. I'd be lost without this app.,Spotify(3)
Positive,There great,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Sporting is a great app. I love it because u can search up the sespific song u want, and it plays it. Iheart radio is not the best cause u can't play the sespific song u want so ya. I gave it only 4 stars cause... IT DOESNT HAVE TAYLOR SWIFT!!! Sad. Thx for reading!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Pricey but great,Spotify(3)
Positive,"The music is, of course, great, but my biggest surprise and delight is under ""Word"", when you browse. A treasure-trove of spoken-word delights, from audio books (complete books!), language tutoring programs, poetry, short stories, guided meditations. It's an unexpected pleasure which I'm having lots of fun exploring.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app for music just wished it didn't cost $9.99 a month after the first 3 months that are $.99.,Spotify(3)
Positive,I think it's great.And it' free.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great app, I'm very happy!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great item,Spotify(3)
Positive,Love this app works great no isues,Spotify(3)
Positive,This is the best program for music and works great with Alexa.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"The music selection is *outstanding* but the user interface leaves a lot to be desired. I think the screen is cluttered and distracting. I find it difficult to find & learn the tools available. That being said, there are quite a few tools that enable to listen to and enjoying the music you want. It's a great tool, just hard to use.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great love finding old music I hadn't heard in a long time plus finding current music.,Spotify(3)
Positive,This app is great. You can listen to music and build playlists and other things.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Ok this is a good app but sense the update you need premium to pick any song you want. Where it use to be a free any song type thing but if you wanted the lessen off line you get premium. Also this is just my opinion but I just don't enjoy lessening to the radio that's just me. so if you like radio get this app and if like to pick and choose your music and don't mind spending a little money get this app. It is great and there lots of features just not all for free. Other than the premium problem I love this app.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great, very fast. Have everything.",Spotify(3)
Positive,This is the greatest app to use it is awesome I am 89 year's old and I am not intelligent! Thanks Spotify for opening my heart I feel like I'm 9 because of you,Spotify(3)
Positive,It's great besides the fact that you get numbered skips but you still have good quality music,Spotify(3)
Positive,"When I initially heard that Spotify would be free on mobile/tablets, I was thrilled. When I saw it wasn't the case on the Kindle, I was sad. When I noticed today that they'd uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.  Now, I'm just disappointed.  I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch. That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:  1. Without premium, one must be online to listen. Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?  2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle. Why is this a problem? Well, it's certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can't do that.  3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It doesn't have the best algorithm for this. Why is this a problem? If I'm listening to ""The Color Spectrum"" and it decides to throw a song from ""Migrant"" in the mix, that's really jarring. Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you (No, I don't like every album that band has put out.) or just lump everything into a few too-big categories (hip-hop, indie, rock, country) and throw the most random s*** from said category at you (And no, (new) Train is nothing like ""Of Great and Mortal Men"".). You only get a small number of skips if you don't have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet? Only it's not. Because that other app you're thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from ""Migrant"" at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.  Spotify on my computer? 5 stars. Spotify on my Kindle? I'll stick with Pandora.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I have been using spotify free for a year now, I used to be able to skip as many times as I wanted to and play any song. I can't do that anymore since the most recent update. Spotify is supposed to be free on tablets and computers, meaning you can choose any song and skip as many times as you want but it still has ads. My moms tablet and my dads both have the ""tablet"" version of spotify. Not my kindle, I now have to use the sucky ""mobile"" version like is on my phone. Please recognize kindles as tablets and not phones. Spotify was great. Please fix this!! I don't understand why kindles are considered different than every other tablet.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great music app much better than the others. Let's you choose from listening to one artist or multiple. Also if you are a student you get a discount which is a plus for me.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Its the best I can play music whenever I want and I can play it anytime with no problem only with WiFi but this app it amazing I really injoy it I hope this will be rated greatly in the future!!!!!__________,Spotify(3)
Positive,"All the music it has is FREE! It runs smoothly and the ads happen after two songs, but who cares? Just turn it off! Great app!!! Totally recommend.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify has a great variety of music and allows you to make your own custom playlists. It also offers a discount to students!,Spotify(3)
Positive,I enjoy my kind of music which is from the 20-60. Now I can listen whenever I want. Its great.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify is a great way to listen to your favorite music. I love to put my head phones on and just listen away. I recommend spotify. All the music is free. You can also listen to music while you play games! You can make playlists of all your favorite songs from country to rock or pop.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I like Spotify, and I love how you can make playlists. However, it would be great if it didn't require WiFi. I do still love it though__!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Works internationally. Great way to hear new music and console goodies. Great sound quality and options for play.,Spotify(3)
Positive,This app is great. I love how you can match the music to your run cadence. I recommend this app and upgrading to premium because not having a commercial interrupt your music is worth the monthly fee.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great internet music.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I recommend this app over all of its competitors.  It is a little hard to understand all the stuff in the app at first but whence you learn that it's a great music app.  You can pick the songs that you only want to listen to or you can have it pick songs for you. Way better then Pandora right.  Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotify is great. Highly recommended!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is my music app! It's opened up my interest in so much new music and that's why I recommend it so much. Very nice display, by the way and very easy to navigate around the various musical genres. Of course, I would love it if they offered a bit more in the international, world music department. And I'm praying that Spotify expands the classical music selection as well. Still, this is one great app for the music lover!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great to listen to Music, but it is a pain to deal with is you are not subscribed. Also, if you do the three months for .99 that comes around every once in a while and do not want to fully subscribe, make sure to cancel the subscription the day before it is going to expire",Spotify(3)
Positive,I really enjoy listening to music on Spotify. I like being able to listen to specific songs and add them to playlist. I have found great music I didn't know about by listening to others' playlists as well. The app is easy to use and the commercials are very reasonable in quantity and content.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great app, great quality music and everything ________",Spotify(3)
Positive,Day two of using this app and I find it to great for using the Bluetooth headphones and getting stuff done while enjoying my favorite music or laying on the couch with the flu...,Spotify(3)
Positive,great music app...,Spotify(3)
Positive,Its great free music online but it would be great if on specific days or months there would be free to listen to if off line and no adds but besides that its great,Spotify(3)
Positive,I love the app. It has a great variety of artists and music for all tastes. I tune in everyday to escape from regular radio stations so I can hear the music that I really enjoy. A bonus is that you can create your personalized playlists. And a discount for students. Great app overall. Highly recommended.,Spotify(3)
Positive,I love it! It's great because I can listen to my favorite artists and I don't have to pay for it.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I really love Spotify my choice for any music player. Better than Pandora actually! It's an all around great app. So it's a must get if your really into music. But the Only thing that grinds my gears is the ads like three ads that all last 30 seconds. So you listen to music for around 20 minutes and these ads play, but all you have to do is pay to get premium.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I had been using this app for free for a year and finally paid for a subscription so I could listen to my playlists while camping. It worked great for several days, but on the day we went to come home the app logged itself out and required internet to log back in. It took an hour of our 6 hour trip to find WiFi, and then most of my songs were not showing as downloaded anymore. Very frustrating! It's been a month since then, and today all my songs are gone again! I won't be renewing my subscription.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great streaming app! Better than Pandora. Free is also a great thing. Check it out... Needtobreathe, John Mark McMillan, it's all good.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love Spotify, but I was looking for a country artist named Garth Brooks, and was disappointed at what showed up: all covers of Garth's songs. I also enjoy some indie artists such as JayteKz. He wasn't on there and neither was Gwar. Somewhat disappointed, but otherwise a great music app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great music, based on your preference!!!__",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love spotify so much. It works much like pandora in which you can create a radio station of an artist to discover new music. However, you can also find a certain song and save it into 'your music' and play it anytime you want where there's WiFi, for free. Overall, it's a great app and definitely worth the download.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I like this app I don't have premium, but I do still like it. If you just want to listen to music for free it's great. They have a great selection of songs. The ads aren't bad and they aren't that long, so I don't pay for the premium, but I have heard that people say the premium is worth it. All in all its a great app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"This is a great way to not only stay up-to-date with your favourite music stars/groups/composers, but the Spotify playlists are a vrery useful way to discover new ones. The interface is ""busy"", but once you get used to where everything can be found, it's very controllable and quick. A great experience.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify has replaced itunes and all other music organizing and streaming programs for me. I have premium, being able to make changes on one device that apply to all is great and being able to download different playlists on different devices means that I can tailor my offline music to my needs.",Spotify(3)
Positive,My favorite music app EVER! I love the playlists for every mood and I love making my own. I really love older music and they have a vast selection!!! Works great no hiccups!,Spotify(3)
Positive,Best music app ever! Great playlists and albums. Spotify rocks!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Its great.remember to download your favorite songs ,so u don't forget._____________",Spotify(3)
Positive,Its great!!! I love it!!! Has almost every song out there!!! ______________,Spotify(3)
Positive,Can't find anything wrong with this app it's awesome. 10x better than Pandora or any of the other music apps I used. Has a great variety of music so u shouldn't have a prob finding something to groove to. And I love that it has viral hits on here as well. OVERALL A DOPE MUSIC APP suggest u check it out,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify has been my favorite music streaming app and one of my favorite apps in general. I can listen to all the music I want and make my own playlists, or list to playlists that were already made up. The sound is great and it's really easy to use. I'll continue to use Spotify because it's a great app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Spotlight has been working great for me I have had it for months and never been discouraged!! I recommend this app to y'all out there!Also getting spotlight premium is totally worth it it only costs a little and does so much!!!!__,Spotify(3)
Positive,Very thorough collection of music. Having access to anything and everything without the guilt associated with stealing artists' intellectual property is always nice. I think the trade off of $9.99 a month for peace of mind and access to a large selection of music is a great thing.,Spotify(3)
Positive,sure I received a working product. Great product and very easy to work with. thank you so much for getting it to me With The Quickness These are great Work amazingly well the next will continue to buy Pretty good.,Spotify(3)
Positive,I would recommend this app for everyone. Although u have to meet a certain age in order to listen to music it's good. But it keeps telling me to get premium or something. Put Spotify is great app. I would recommend this app to everyone. If u love music u should totally get this app. You get to listen to every single song u heard. Y name it it's there. THANKS SPOTIFY!!!____,Spotify(3)
Positive,I really enjoy that they have such a great selection.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I'm so pleased with this music app. If you truly love great, hard to find tracks, especially live recordings, Spotify is the best.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great music app only if you have premium,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Amazing. Simple. Modern and stylish. Great quality. Exhaustive library of songs. Fun to use.  There's many easy ways you can listen to music. Whether you'd like to simply create a unique playlist of your own, listen to entire albums, create a radio station, or tap on browse to listen to playlist already provided to fit whatever mode your in, all are simple, fun ways to listen to the music that you love.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great music application, perfect for me.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great app. Not every song under the sun is available, but that's not their fault so still 5 star app. Get premium though for songs on the go without data.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Premium membership is well worth it for the ""For daily mix"" and ""Weekly Discover"" playlists akonr. Makes a great gift for a kid you could add to your family plan as well.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I can't live without Spotify, seriously I feel like my days are missing a little something if I don't listen to some music, even if for short spams of time. With this app, I have my music with me while I read; just add a cup of coffee and I can say I'm in heaven.  The app runs smoothly on my Kindle Fire6, no issues whatsoever. It synchronizes perfectly and sound quality is great (taking into account the Kindle speaker's limitations). If you've used Spotify on your PC/Mac, or Android devices; you'll see no difference in here.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Can't really function w/o it. Probably the best music app that has come around since the fall of the great original Zune subscription app.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Just get it, and get Premium, you won't regret it!! You can make as many playlists as you want, follow many great artists, listen to your favorite artists music, mix things up, see what your friends are listening to, and many other things imaginable.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"The overwhelming amount of music you can stream for free is astounding!! All you need is a internet connection you can also list in to music without internet but be warned if you don't have some sort of paying card then your just gonna have to stick with your first option  All in all great music",Spotify(3)
Positive,This app is hands down the best app there is and more than perfect for those who love music and are listening to it often or even people who just want a little backround music for a party. Extremely great and you can any song for no price and once every half an hour you might have one ad very great app. I definitely recommend!! If you have any doughts dont because you will not be dissapointed at all.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify is a great music app. You simple just search for any track, artist, or album and start listening for free. I love this free app, I use it all the time. You can create a great music collection.",Spotify(3)
Positive,All performance wise it's perfect. But it would be great if it has Alexa support.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I think this is a great app because I can chill with my friends and listen to all kinds of music. I like queen, beatles, citizen king, and more!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great platform for curating a play list and discovering new artists!,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great music app all the new music quickly,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I had Pandora and the iHeart radio app, but neither compare to Spotify. Unlimited skips, huge library of music, and great quality sound. But Spotify Premium is even better. Download songs and listen to them without WiFi/cell service. Only have had one problem; a glitch with the app mot letting me sign in, but was fixed. Besides that, best music app there is.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I really love Spotify. Great playlists, great variety, reasonable ad interruptions for the free version. I use this over Pandora, Amazon music and several others. My one complaint: occasionally the music won't play on my Kindle fire. I can not figure out an explanation. There seems to be no rhyme or reason that I can identify or that is consistent.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I LOVE IT!!! So many great songs, many great playlists, and.... ITS ALL FREE. If you get premium thers more great stuff!! GET IT NOW!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"The app will not work on my Samsung Galaxy 5 phone. Spotify has tried to help me, but this is a known issue on this phone. They want me to pull my SIM card, but that requires me opening my Otter Box etc. and it is just not worth the trouble. I do use them on the computer, and it works great. Really SAD that I cannot use this app on my phone.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Title says it all. Pandora maybe great, but it has nothing on Spotify. The ability to pick and choose your songs is in of itself amazing, but add on the fact they have these custom made playlists with almost all types of genres from Today's Pop to 60s and from Rap to Concentrated Scratch. This app truly is a music lovers choice.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"How come when I use the app on my tablet (Kindle Fire) I can play any song I want, but when I use my phone, the songs have to be shuffled? It's great on the tablet, but on the phone I may as well use Pandora, which has an eadier-to-use interface. Make the phone work like the tablet, and you'll get 5 stars.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app. Great Music.,Spotify(3)
Positive,I so enjoy Spotify!!! Its great to listen to all my favorite music. Pleased!!,Spotify(3)
Positive,Super easy yo use and great selection. Large diverse catalog,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great app to have. Great selection of music and you cab personalize to have just songs that you enjoy,Spotify(3)
Positive,This app is aamazing! It has pretty much every thing from guns n roses to dropkick Murphys (both of which I recommend). My only complaint is there are these things called premium features and it says upgrade to Spotify premium to use and you can't. But other wise great app ____________________,Spotify(3)
Positive,"I love this app! It's runs great, and has all the song I'm looking for. The only severe flaw to this app would be that it needs WiFi for everything! You can't listen to any of the music if you don't have WiFi. Besides that great app!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify has great music and it's easy to find a Song I would recommend this App to people who love to listen to Music and need a good app",Spotify(3)
Positive,Love it! Great variety available. Wonderful options.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Amazing and great because its practically free but for some reason offline it doesn't work ,even though I downloaded the songs a dozen times. Please fix and I will rate 5 stars, no 100 stars! Its an awesome music app! ____ ________ ________",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great selection, easy to get to it and huge podcast selecciÑn.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"The limitations levied on mobile devices intended to manipulate premium purchase are excessive- almost rendering it unusable. But if you're using pc or tablet, spotify basic is great. A competitor is needed to save them from self inflicted alienation of their own consumers, adds and offline mode are incentive enough for premium.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Outstanding app to listen, reflect and enjoy our favorite music. Would be great if I could skip from song-to song with out listening to that particular song on my mobile device just like I can on my computer.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Stream it all day at work. I love that I can choose a whole album or choose from some of the great playlists that have setup.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great app! I have it on my phone, tablet, and computer and love how I can pick up from wherever I was!!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Works great from my iPhone to iPhone speaker. I love the endless music to choose from.,Spotify(3)
Positive,Nothing comes close to the variety of artists and albums. I've found albums that I lost years ago and new artists thati discovered from my kids. Great app!,Spotify(3)
Positive,Great music & updates,Spotify(3)
Positive,It is super awesome you get to pick the music and it's wonderful for playlists I love this app it's great for anyone!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great service, nice music selection",Spotify(3)
Positive,"The most amazing music app I've ever used, although i haven't gotten premium yet it is still is a great app to use to listen to your favorite music.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Awesome! All the songs I was looking for and some oldies I almost forgot about. Great!,Spotify(3)
Positive,"When I downloaded the app and tried to sign up for Spotify it kept on saying that there is an error. I've been trying to sign up for a week now, I'll just have to resort to something else. I'm sure Spotify is great but amazon should improve apps like these BC there are a lot!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"As soon as there is room in my budget I'll get Spotify Premium, great service since they added the mobile capabilities. Very easy to listen to a specific artist, unlike other streaming services. Has helped prepare me for many a concert. And for road trips, the sci fi radio dramas are unbeatable!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Downloading this app was a great idea in my part. The app ( like pandora) had a variety of both music and radio stations. But this one allows the listeners to have a choice on what to pick. So if you wish to have a bit of music in your life than downlaod this app.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"It is great that you can pick your songs and play them over and over (unlike pandora) but $10 a month is bordering expensive if you, like me, like to have 10 apps that have a monthly charge. It all adds up. Even though I like this app, because it is more than twice the price of Pandora Plus, I will likely cancel it in the future. Pandora is easier to use and works for about everything I need it for.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"I've had a great time making my playlist, love that I can play it offline.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Its reputation speaks for itself. Easy to use and customize. Organized in such a way so that you can spend less time researching new music and more time enjoying it. Five stars. Great investment.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great app..wish multiple users at one time was easier, by overall great app.",Spotify(3)
Positive,I like the app and the music is free. But sometimes the freezes. But other then that specify is the perfect app to download and get great and free music. So it is a great app.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Overall great, no problems added from iTunes and other mp3 so all is in one place.",Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great app. With the Fire tablet, even plays on-demand songs in the free version! Not so with the free Android version, but, still love it.",Spotify(3)
Positive,What's so great about Spotify? Well you get to pick what ever songs you want replay your songs and play them offline anytime .,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Great music Can't play without WiFi unless u download songs Otherwise great",Spotify(3)
Positive,Super great app. Has every song I look app. I recommend this app.,Spotify(3)
Positive,"Spotify never disappoints! I have it on kindle fire, laptop, and mobile phone. Easy to use, great quality, and simple to customize and large selection ofmusic. I have so many fave artists that I discovered from Spotify suggestions. Thanks!",Spotify(3)
Positive,"When I couldn't find any other music app that worked, I turned to Spotify. This app is the best music app. It is so simple to use, has great sound quality, and has almost any song you could think of, old or new. I highly recommend this app. When I want music, I am so happy that I found Spotify. BEST MUSIC APP EVER!",Spotify(3)
Positive,Great way to listen to your favorite music! I just wish it had a sleep timer. It would be nice to fall asleep listening to my music. I bought the 99¢ membership deal that lasts 3 months (a special they had going during December). It's nice not having the commercials play and being able to select the song I want to listen to on my phone.,Spotify(3)
Positive,This is a good app. I think the only fall back is not being able to skip songs as many times as I want but other than that it's a great app.,Spotify(3)
Positive,This is the best music app! Almost all songs are on here (a rare few are not) Great for work or sleep. Only thing is how many adds there are when you do not have a premium account. (However I have premium so it might of changed) I would totally recommend this app.,Spotify(3)

Positive,"I have spotify on my home computer and it works great, but on my kindle fire I can only play music in shuffle mode. If I only have one song saved for an artist, I play shuffle mode and it plays some other song by the artist. If I wanted to have music chosen for me, I would have downloaded Pandora.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Love this app! I used the free version for the longest time but the ads did eventually get tiring so I upgraded. Great at work for drowning out co-workers!,Spotify(3)

Positive,"I purchsed the app because its great and so i could use it on my smart tv. But I can not control the Tv app from another device as I can with youtube and others. Also, when I search a track the results will show playlists that the track appears in. Not on the Tv app though! Then on top of that, there is no radio option. Because I use the Tv app often these little features are huge.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"Good app! I can listen to all my favorite songs and put them in playlists! The catch: your music is stuck in shuffle mode and you can't take it off unless you have premium, then it works great! Also, sometimes you can't preview the song you want because it is stuck in shuffle.",Spotify(3)
Positive,Really easy to use eclectic range of music available great sound,Spotify(3)
Positive,"This app is great but, you can't play any song u want u have to go on shuffle and I HATE it so to me I think it's four stars and it's like Pandora but u have single songs and playlist but some parts you need to pay but if you need a GOOD song app get Iheart radio.",Spotify(3)

Positive,"This is a very good app,I've used it for about 2 years now, my only issue is how often there's an ad but that won't stop you from singing in the shower!",Spotify
Positive,"The app is great. Nice design and interface. It's easy to learn and a good service, but I would appreciate the same functionality between tablet and phone. I think it's a bit inconvenient that my phone/phablet doesn't have the same access to songs without shuffle, as a tablet does.",Spotify
Positive,I find that this app is better than others that I have tried. However it does seem to freeze up from time to time during songs changings I guess nothing is perfect. The download went fine with no hangups. Overall it's a good application.,Spotify
Positive,"Has lots of popular songs, however I was disappointed that Taylor Swift wasn't on here. She is my favorite singer, so I wanted to hear her music. Otherwise, good music app. You can create your own public channels and playlists. I recommend",Spotify

Positive,"A few too many interruptions for my taste,. But overall very good.",Spotify
Positive,Is very good and very helpful for studying. I like that it keeps playing your music even if you exit out of the Spotify app. Could add more anime open is tho ____,Spotify
Positive,Good for relaxation. As a big music person I would give more stars if I could,Spotify
Positive,For someone like me who has eclectic tastes and listen to music based on moods this is perfect. I was told it as a good music service but I didn't want to try out of stubbornness but now I wish I had it sooner. Get the premium. It's worth it,Spotify
Positive,Very good music app. Works well on my Kindle Fire HDX. Plays the music in the background while I preform other tasks. Nice selection of music and artists available.,Spotify
Positive,This app is very good I get to listen to my favorite music when I have WiFi. However u need to get spotify premium in order to listen to music without WiFi.,Spotify
Positive,"Easy to use, all the songs I want are on there and all kinds of versions. The only thing I don't like is that when I want to test out a song to see if it's the right one it doesn't let me listen to it without downloading it. But it's still a good app. Two thumbs up! :)",Spotify
Positive,It's a really good app,Spotify
Positive,Love the function ability. Easy to use. Good mix of radio stations,Spotify
Positive,It's amazing I can listen to whatever I want even not on shuffle It is so good at hearing Harry styles and all the 1D songs and 1D people,Spotify
Positive,"I practically depend on this app for my daily music needs, I am band trash (think of that what you may because I just went to emÀtiÀnal rÀad shÀw yesterday (June 18, 2016)) so hehe. But this app is absolutely amazing, waay better than apple music which is just a more expensive copy of spotify, spotify is free unless you want premium, but if you don't have premium and you play mudic on shuffle it actually gives good recommendations for songs, for example if you're listening to toxic by britney spears because you like that song or like me are in the phandom or something they won't play like my chemical romance after, they will reccomend like a song similar to toxic. I'm awkward just get the app.",Spotify
Positive,"Lots and lots of music to put you in whatever mood you to be in, or get out of or got back in time and relive the good old days!!! Music is the message and music is the cure!!!",Spotify

Positive,"It's really good for my wide range of music tastes, easy to use, it also allows me to pick the song that I wish to listen to rather than just hope it plays on Pandora, and (in my experience) very little ads.",Spotify
Positive,"I 'M VERY HAPPY YOU MADE A WONDERFUL APP SPOTIFY MUSIC, (ARTIST OF MUSIC TO ME). I WAS VERY IMPRESSED THAT EVERY ARTIST I REMEMBER YOU HAVE. IT'S ALRIGHT YOU HAVE 1TO 2 ADS SINCE YOU DON'T CLIP THE MUSIC. YOU CAN HEAR A LOT SONGS OF SAME ARTIST AT ONCE OR SHUFFLE THE ARTIST OR MUSIC. I HOPE THIS APP NEVER CHANGES HOW GOOD IT IS!!!!!!!!!",Spotify
Positive,Very good app! I like that I can use my kindle to control the spotify app on the PS4 so I can play music on my stereo.,Spotify
Positive,"Has all of the new and hot songs, only con is it doesn't have some older songs. And you have to get premium for it to be good. Otherwise great. You can make your own playlist. Recommended.",Spotify
Positive,I don't think there is a better music streaming service out there. Love the integration with Sonos. Good integration with Alexa too.,Spotify
Positive,I love that Spotify has all kinds of music. I can choose between music for me and my husband and my kids. It's all current music and some forgotten goodies.,Spotify
Positive,Very good I approve of it,Spotify
Positive,"Wish there was free offline music, but very good formatting and easy to use",Spotify
Positive,"This app was hella stellar //on tablets and computers// but idk what happened but now you have limited skips, only can shuffle, etc. Like on mobile.which it didn't used to be like that....Spotify what's good??  Other than that its decent",Spotify
Positive,"You will have a good time with Spotify. You CAN use it, fee free, however Premium is the best. Whatever else you are paying for, each month, make room for this service. All the music you want, when you want it with no library to worry over. Cheers!",Spotify
Positive,However Pandora is just as good.,Spotify
Positive,Good app.,Spotify
Positive,Aesthetic app out there. It has all type of music to fit your liking. I'm telling you this app is great and it's also free. It's so good that I bought the premium for only 99 cents so I can listen to all my music with out the assistance of Wi-Fi.,Spotify
Positive,I would give it 5 stars but I used the free play load to see if buying the downloads wold be a good thing to buy so I did and now I want to buy it but I can't because it said I bought it but I haven't and I would be happy if u fixed it thank u,Spotify
Positive,"This app pretty good to bad it doesn't some underground music and Japanese rock music. I haven't run into any problem of finding music or commercials, that's if you pay your subscription.",Spotify
Positive,"Spotify, isn't too bad. I like it however I don't think you should have to buy premium for some of the features. Other wise excellent app.",Spotify

Positive,"It's pretty good. If you like skrillex you can listen to his music If you like imagine dragons you can listen to them Pretty much anyone________________",Spotify
Positive,I think this app is amazing. It was a little confusing at first but with their guide I was able to figure it out. They have a very big collection of all types of music. I really wish that I didn't have to have internet but it is still a very good app. This app very much suits the kindle.,Spotify
Positive,"This app seems amazing. However, I wonder whether artists are compensated properly. Ads are really not very intrusive. But why is there not under Amazon apps the opportunity to pay the .99 cents as a form of upgrade like with some other apps. In addition I have wondered why Amazon has changed things with regards to music. Now if I go straight to Music - Store, all I get is Prime listening stuff. I do not want to pay $10.00 a month just for listening to some music. I do like to buy tracks or CDs if I like them. I discovered one can go straight to ""shop"" and then one still has the ability to sample the tracks, or put a CD or track on your Carousel and then when they suggest other music you still can sample some tracks. I used to love the radio app Tune-In but they also changed things and truly I wonder why. Now I no longer like that one. If something is good, please leave it alone.",Spotify
Positive,I like it. I wish it was cheaper though. I can't afford it every month. I also wish it was just a bit easier to sort songs and albums. But all in all it's pretty good.,Spotify
Positive,Good music,Spotify
Positive,Spotify is very good if your on the go you can create playlist and save and download your favorite songs and artist and listen offline,Spotify
Positive,"This app is really good for listening to music and the sound quality is good. I just wish they had more of Taylor Swift and other artists. Also at this point my spotify/kindle has glitches and I can't pull down the top of my screen and see the Spotify tab to skip forward and/or back. Other than that, this is a great app! However, when the trailer for ñ The Visit "" came out, Spotify kept playing that trailer and it freaked me out. But just get premium if that's a problem. They have really great deals. So I would highly recommend this app for all the music lovers. ( LIKE MEH!!! ) ______",Spotify
Positive,"It works better than the normal radio apps, and it does a good job recommending music. It's also very easy to use.",Spotify
Positive,Good App,Spotify
Positive,"Excellent app for just chillin out with your friends or your self for a good jam sesh, would defiantly recommend.",Spotify
Positive,It's good when you have premium but if you're like me the Commercials didn't bother me that much. I would listen to commercials but now I tried out premium I'm Positive premium is worth it. I would recommend it to all my friends,Spotify
Positive,Very good app allows you to get basically any song you want for free. Of course there are some songs not on their and the ads are annoying. But overall the best platform to get real published good songs.,Spotify
Positive,"OMG!!! It is good, especially when your going to sleep listen too. Hope you like it as much as me.",Spotify
Positive,"Good, a little difficult to use",Spotify
Positive,All my favorite classic Brazilian bossa nova and jazz are there. The groups and sub-groups are very helpful. Amazing selection and the audio is really good if you use quality headphones. (I am using this app on a Kindle Fire).,Spotify
Positive,This app is very good you can't beat this they have everything all kinds of music from older generation to up to date from R&B to Spanish it's Great you can even make your own playlist songs YOU like it's really Fantastic I get EXCITED TALKING ABOUT IT it's a thing to have GOT to go MY SONG ON__,Spotify
Positive,I love this app! It is easy to work. It is updated on music. The one thing I found not good was it doesn't have much Taylor Swift songs. It doesn't have bad blood. But that's a little thing so I give it 5/5 stars! GET IT NOW!,Spotify
Positive,good and a great one and thank you.,Spotify
Positive,"This app is a must have. Nothing bad to say.. Highly recommend! Don't take my word for it, download it and see for yourself.",Spotify
Positive,This app allow you to download most songs not all because they might not be there the only bad thing is the amount of skips you have an you have to be a member to play a song you want to hear instead of it being on shuffle which you can't get rid if unless you are a member.,Spotify
Positive,"I Love you Spotify, thanks so much for always supplying the best music of my choice! And your choices of music are good too!",Spotify
Positive,"Wow, just as good as the desktop version, no, better because of the touch interface. This makes playlist control terrific!",Spotify
Positive,"Great app, runs good, definitely recommend the service as well",Spotify
Positive,It's good and all but still I watched this ad and it sad 30 minutes of ad free but next song it was the same to ads I a row no song in between bet great app____,Spotify
Positive,Wonderful I can listen to music for FREE! good songs like unity and artists like monstercat and skilled!______ very good u should get______ -powergun53,Spotify
Positive,"I don't want to sound as if I am being cheap, but I've been waiting to put it on my Kindle without being charged for a long time. Why they didn't do this sooner I'll never know. It works very well for my needs and I am glad to have on my Kindle. I can now listen and enjoy the music I want. For those who gave this a three stars or lower I am sorry you did. It has a few bad points, but you have to over look them and move on. I mean for its free, and there's nothing perfect these days. Take my word for it, down load it and enjoy. It's free what more do you want?",Spotify
Positive,You can't see the thriller behind what the break of dawn it has. Don't stop till you get enough of this app. It is so good for being bad like a jam.,Spotify
Positive,"While the premium version is really good it could be pricey for some, although the free version serves me perfectly fine",Spotify
Positive,"Good music, works well on the Fire 7.",Spotify
Positive,"Unlike Pandora and Songza, once the music started on Spotify Music, I could find no obvious way to stop the app without logging-out. If there is an ""X"" or ""Quit"" it is well hidden.  I did enjoy the music collections once I found them. There was quiet a variety to choose from. The sound quality was good on my Droid Turbo. The app did not always recognize my WiFi connection even when at 100% signal strength, telling me ""no internet connection.""  Generally speaking I found this app to be overly complicated and lacking intuitive usage control. Yet the app has quite a following. As such I speculate it may be targeted at a demographic younger than my own.  If you enjoy apps that require (in my opinion) a lot of interaction and (seem) heavily oriented to social media you may find Spotify Music worthwhile. It wasn't for me.",Spotify
Positive,"I love this app, I use it 24/7. I have had this app for 2 days and I Love it. My dad had this app on his iPhone and he really likes it so I thought I would try it out. It is so worth it. It is so easy to sign up at the beginning. I already have 57 songs on my playlist. SUCH GOOD MUSIC!",Spotify
Positive,Easy to use and nice selection of music. B it a bad price either. Capable of streaming and downloading high quality sounding music. Good all around service.,Spotify
Positive,Good??? Idk,Spotify
Positive,"I think that it is very annoying that I have the free mode so I can't listen to any song I want I have to listen to all of the other songs and wait till I get to the song I want and also you ONLY get 6 skips so you can ONLY skip 6 times then u have to wait an hour  other than that is a good app",Spotify
Positive,Really good app my only complaint is that there is no hevey metal section__,Spotify
Positive,Good!,Spotify
Positive,I was just using the music download app it was good but couldn't shuffle and had trouble changing songs but this as long as you are in WiFi (or pay the dollar to make it available offline work awesome it even gives you recommendations and tells you when the band is on tour. It amazes me,Spotify
Positive,A Very good app. I would recommand it to everyone out there,Spotify
Positive,"This is a great app because: 1)You get a 7 day free trial of free music when u make an account. 2)Music is clear and not bad.  Discovering New music every day!",Spotify

Positive,This is a really good app with almost (I can't find ready aim fire by imagine dragons) every single song! Luv it!,Spotify
Positive,"Received it on Oct 5 and not not sure if it's going to work. It connected easily but has been getting it's first charge so hasn't been used yet. My previous one lasted five years. If this is as good, I'll be happy.",Spotify
Positive,"I am really impressed with the variety of artists and music,very easy to use.The only down side is that it is kind of expensive for a basic subscription,and you don't get many options with the free veraion,but is still a really good app",Spotify
Positive,Good music player,Spotify
Positive,This app is awesome! Justvwish I could listen to music for free without internet. Or WiFi. Still good though____,Spotify
Positive,"I mostly listen to classical, 19th century popular music, and jazz. The selection is good enough that I rarely listen to my CD collection anymore. But the computer app for my iMac, running the latest OS, is a memory hog. I find the interface to be cluttered. The ability to order & retrieve saved albums is not very flexible. I will note, however, that the interface is constantly being improved - it's better now than when I first bought it.  And Spotify really ought to figure out how to set up a tip jar for the artists.",Spotify
Positive,Good,Spotify
Positive,An amazing app. Its good for people that like to listen to and find new music when out and about.,Spotify
Positive,Really great app for listening to music. Even the free version is good. I would like in-app notifications though for the artists I am following.,Spotify
Positive,"You can not download any song you find. It's very unique as far as genres also it has best of the best tracks from backbin the day. ONLY BAD PART YOUR NOT ABLE TO DOWLOAD ANY SONGS. TO YOUR DRVICE.____",Spotify
Positive,If you are looking for a easy to use music that works then you have to get this app. You could get over a hundred songs and they are free songs. This app I have used before and it is just as good as on the computer as it is on mobile. Best App for music you could get,Spotify
Positive,I have been able to find every song I was looking for. I would definitely recommend this app for anyone who is looking for a good music app that you can put the songs you like most on.,Spotify
Positive,It is pretty good but there are a few cons one is that you need a premium membership to use it with out Wi-Fi and there's WAY too many ads and one more is that you need too search for a lot of the music and you can't change your username. Please look at this before you get it.,Spotify
Positive,This app works really well and it has almost every song you can think of with some exceptions. I wish that there would have been a tutorial on how to use it. Another thing is that this almost sounds too good to be true like there might be some sort of catch to it. Overall really nice though.,Spotify
Positive,"I can't figure out how to go premium, it sucks not app but that and u can't listen to it everywhere unless u got internet or data, but I guess other than its good.",Spotify
Positive,So good it knows lots of good songs and its better than pandora,Spotify
Positive,"Great set up and everything but my sister got your offline free trial for 30 days and only got it for a week. Also it got kind of annoying when all of a sudden the adds started coming in at random times when my songs were on shuffle. Other than that it's a really good app, and I give it a thumbs up.",Spotify
Positive,"Very good quality music app! Love getting free music too...However, the premium package costs too much for me. I'm a college kid who can't afford spending $9/month. If it was $3, that would be awesome!",Spotify
Positive,"Good app for artist you love  Wish they would generate playlists with other similar artists though.",Spotify
Positive,"My favorite music app, sound quality is good, my choices of songs wonderful, including the Christmas music is what I want too hear, the only problem I have had that it deleted itself, I don't know why but it did, I downloaded and it came back, I hope it doesn't happen again.",Spotify
Positive,"Such a good app for the way I spend my time because of my hectic schedule.I can listen to my favorite songs whenever, wherever! Thanx spotify",Spotify
Positive,I really like spotify and I think it is great. The UI is amazing and the quality of the music is really good. I also love the fact that students only have to pay 5 dollars a month instead of ten. This is a great app and I really enjoy listening to music on here.,Spotify
Positive,"Its a solid music app. The selection stays up.. Thanks Spotify, keep up the good work.",Spotify
Positive,"I am loving this app. Able to enjoy all of my favorite music anytime I want. They have all my oldies,but goodies my gospel, my R&B, right at my fingertips. The premium package is worth every penny.",Spotify
Positive,Such a good music app! I can literally find anything!! Paying for premium does give you more though __,Spotify
Positive,"I loved it because it gave me various types of music I could listen to, but I was kind of disappointed that you can not listen to them without internet on the road for free you must pay. But otherwise it has good quality, but it may not give you all the recent songs.",Spotify
Positive,This is great for long car rides or when your on an air plane. Its awesome for music for parties or just listening to music in general. It has so many viriaties of music. Keep up the good work __________,Spotify
Positive,"This was a good music app but the problem was I couldn't download anything so I couldn't listen to music on the road. Also, I can't pick my music from my music list. I have to shuffle them.",Spotify
Positive,"Still getting used to it, but so far so good. Wish it was easier to select the songs you want, but it's not a hassle either.",Spotify
Positive,"I love spotify, but you shouldn't have to pay for anything on it. Like downloading music so you can listen offline. Why not just switch to pandora? Even though spotify is good, it only deserves three stars. It could earn five stars from me if it would only let me listen to music offline for free.",Spotify
Positive,"Spotify makes my day better. I get told Spotify is not as good as Pandora, but I stand by it every step of the way. I love listening to it when I am working, and reading, and gaming. Spotify is in my life most of my day!!",Spotify
Positive,Good,Spotify

Positive,Soo good!______________________________,Spotify
Positive,"I absolutely LOVE spotify. The free version is good but the premium is amazing, best 10 bucks a month i ever spent. Totally worth it. Create your own playlists, sync your music, look up and play every song by any artist. Literally the ONLY downside to spotify is no TOOL.. other than that its downright kickass.",Spotify
Positive,"I love spotify! There's absolutely nothing wrong with this app. You can listen to any song you want, and it's a great way to listen before you buy. It also gives you good recommendations for other artists/songs you might like. Good quality, easy to navigate, Spotify easily deserves five stars.",Spotify
Positive,"Spodify is a very good app to listen to music on other than Pandora ,if you were to choose Spotify over Pandora you made a good decision",Spotify
Positive,"Good, but it has TOO MANY ADS. It also says 30-minutes ad-free but I never get it..",Spotify
Positive,I think Spotify is good to use cause you turn off your phone and it keepzs playin,Spotify
Positive,"OK most people say that it sucks without premium, but i don't have premium and all it is, is that you have to listen to a few adds now and then , trust me its not that bad! I highly recommend the app!",Spotify
Positive,"""Spotify Music"" is Fantastic! I am really enjoying the various selections of music! Keep up the good work!",Spotify
Positive,"Amazing app, thousands of artists so good that I don't mind the adds. Makes Pandora look sad!",Spotify
Positive,Good! Yay! Can I leave now! I just wanna go home! This is a good app... Can I please go home!,Spotify
Positive,"This app is so good for music. The only downside is that there's no Taylor Swift, only covers. And a few artists don't have one or two or their songs, but this app is beautiful in every other way. I love it to death.",Spotify
Positive,I downloaded an awesome music app but I Deleted it and couldn't find it on the app store again and I couldn't find anymore good apps like that but then I saw spotify and I decided to get it and I have to say this is much better than any app I have EVER used.,Spotify

Positive,What's not to like.Good selection of free music.Not to much advertising.Aces in my book,Spotify
Positive,"Too much current. Add some 70's, 80's, even some 60's. Good old fashioned Rock and Roll",Spotify
Positive,"When I can get into it, it's good. But 70% of the time I can't log in to it........So it's not good at all........ :(",Spotify
Positive,Its was good at first i was loving it but now after this new update its gone bad you can't play your own music you can find the song but you can't play it with out shuffle play so yeah,Spotify
Positive,"Its good. Not limited to only shuffle. Pay the same price as pandora, and get alot more.",Spotify

Positive,Soooooo Good,Spotify
Positive,"I can't express how much I love this app. It's so much cheaper than buying albums especially when there's so much music you want to own. And more importantly, the quality of the music is so high! Good for those who feel guilty about illegally downloading music content online.",Spotify
Positive,So thoroughly enjoyable. Added new music to my liking just cause sounds so good.,Spotify
Positive,Really enjoy this app. Even the ads aren't that bad. Except when you're in the mIddle of a guided meditation playlist :P,Spotify
Positive,"Its good for making YouTube videos for my YouTube. It makes my videos have sang! P.S my name is gold_HD but you have to put ""joebembry"" in order for it to get up. Then click on the plushie dog. My videos are kid friendly, funny and I have a kid channel named ""xvavir's toy house!"" (Though his name is spelled Xavier.__) the other channel is just JUNK so don't bother to go on it. It has no vids right now.........",Spotify
Positive,"So far so good. Have this on my phone(droidx -old slow phone. Very slow to open on phone-)  As for the kindle fire HDX it's so only crashed 3-4 Times in the last few days. No complaints.  Very happy. Responsive .",Spotify
Positive,"Use to be good until this __ ""update"" came out I barely get to listen to MY MUSIC mostly suggested music. ( (want to delete)",Spotify
Positive,"Spotlight allows one to browse over thousands of new and old songs, even without premium the ads are not very long. It is very good for exercising.",Spotify
Positive,"Easy app,it's very organized,and it has good music",Spotify
Positive,"I use Spotify all the time and find it more convenient tan downloading music to my phone. Good program, offers lots of artists and keeps up with the times.",Spotify
Positive,Good app. My daughter love it when we are in the car or when she dances to it,Spotify
Positive,This app is very good if u want to listen and not have to pay money it's the best Music app I have ever seen I use to use iTunes but this is way better,Spotify
Positive,Good app could listen forever but! On some devices you can only do shuffle play then this app is no fun you have been warned.,Spotify
Positive,"I'm not crazy that I must subscribe to avoid ads or download playlists. I wish they could just sell the playlists for downloading. Plus, the black background is hard on the eyes. Too bad there are no skins to switch to.",Spotify
Positive,Spotifys New update is not good at all. You can't play the song you want when you want you have certain amount of skips. It is starting to get like Pandora which is not good at all.,Spotify
Positive,Spotify is good for listening to music and creating your own selection of music!!!!!!!,Spotify
Positive,"Not a bad app. Haven't experienced any problems so far, and there's plenty of good music offline, without having to pay for the app if you're cheap like me.",Spotify
Positive,It is good for listening to your favorite songs,Spotify
Positive,"I like what this App, Has to Do, See, & Play good Music & Who can use it!!!",Spotify
Positive,"Sporting is really good! However, it recently got an update where you need premium to choose a song on mobile. That, in my opinion, is stupid. They NEED to fix that.",Spotify
Positive,I really like it. But having to go through a whole album just to get the one song you want is the worst. That is only bad thing.,Spotify
Positive,Good to listen to.,Spotify
Positive,It's good but I think it shouldn't be so expensive should be 5$ a month,Spotify
Positive,Spotify has a large songs list. This is the best music app in my opinion. It is very simple to select or find a song. Music list are very useful as it offers a good selection according to day or preferences. Very simple its better. Recommended.,Spotify
Positive,Good,Spotify
Positive,This is like the only thing that is good to listen to music on my kindle all the rest of the stuff it did not work so thanks ________________________,Spotify
Positive,Well it's pretty good but my only problem is the premium thing if it was free I would like it a bit more,Spotify
Positive,The music is good offline but the suggested songs are not good it's like let me listen to what I want!!!!!,Spotify
Positive,"Just what I always wanted, Pandora with options. Now I don't have to go buy an entire album to see if it is good. I just wish that some artists wouldn't take there songs off of here and would live for the people, not just for themselves.",Spotify
Positive,As good as they come! Dependable and complete. Love it!,Spotify
Positive,Very good for party's and just to listen.__,Spotify
Positive,"I listen to Spotify daily, it is good for listening for music and its good for exploring new possibilities in terms of new music.",Spotify
Positive,"Pretty good, better than the free iHeart app. Most times. LAMEST PART; THERE IS NOT ONE REAL TRUE BEATLES SONG, the only thing users have access to is knock off Beatles tribute bands and covers. Uber-lame. Get it cuz it's free though, I guess.",Spotify
Positive,I like this app but the only thing I don't like about it is that it is missing lots of songs that I would only find on sound cloud but in all it is good and is easy to organize.,Spotify
Positive,Not much to complain about its good and free. I like it,Spotify
Positive,"Good app overall but it is not very intuitive- the IU needs to be redesigned to make it easier. How do we de-select a song? More work required, yet the concept itself is great as it has allowed me to pick in world music!",Spotify
Positive,Nice music recommendations and pretty good quality____,Spotify
Positive,I love spotify but it sucks when you want to play some james on the road but you have no WIFI and im not paying for it neither. But pretty good!,Spotify
Positive,"Spotify has a good track record of good UI (user interface) and their Kindle app is also indicative of that. Very easy to use, go through playlist and even discover music.",Spotify
Positive,Once I became a premium subscriber never looked back. My ipod and offline music collection.. completely mothballed. Such a good product,Spotify
Positive,"Good for playing music in wifi. Soundcloud lets you listen anywhere without wifi free, but spotify is what i prefer",Spotify
Positive,THIS APP IS AMAZING THEY HAVE ANY SONG U WANT N I MEAN ANY SONG THIS APP IS SO GOOD BUT THE ONLY THING ITS MISSING IS VIDEOS BUT MUSIC WE IN THE I RECOMEND U GET THIS APP (put in all caps to tell u how good it is) :);)/)$)&)!),Spotify

Positive,"I believe I just smoked to much man, this is a far out application. You can chill and listen to some good stuff here. I love Swiss rolls to bro. Anyways spotlight bro. It's the only thing I like man. It's awesome.",Spotify
Positive,Better than apps that make stations for you based on an artist or song you like. This app lets you listen to all the songs and artists you really want to hear. Can't think of anything bad to say about that.,Spotify
Positive,"I saw the good reviews and decided to try it out, but I was disappointed. It doesn't allow you to search the music you want, and this is extremely disappointing because I'm into fanmade songs on YouTube, like songs by Joydreamer, Sirhamnet, etc.",Spotify
Positive,It was good until they updated it so now you have to pay to skip songs unlimeted! Now you can only do shuffle if you haven't played for the premium. Other wise I love it.,Spotify
Positive,Really good app for my favorite music and new music love this ap,Spotify
Positive,I love such a good a thank god for the people who made it ______,Spotify

Positive,"The sound quality is amazing and there are countless songs, however if you don't have premium, the music is not available without WiFi. You can listen to it with WiFi but it becomes useless when WiFi is unavailable. Pretty good though.",Spotify
Positive,Bade ass,Spotify
Positive,Good app. It takes you right to the music you want to listen to and doesn't give you the runaround. Plus paying for the unlimited access gets you no ads and more skips or unlimited skips. I'm not sure. Basically I'm saying that you should get this app. :),Spotify
Positive,Uhuh. Good sound quality. zLitHitz.,Spotify
Positive,Just love this program good going. I wouldn't change anything..,Spotify

Positive,It used to be good until it updated now you only have a certain amount of skips and you can play the direct song you want to listen to they ruined it sadly __________,Spotify
Positive,It was good till just a few moments ago. A song will play and then it will just stop playing after a few seconds. I tried to see if it was my head phones. It wasn't. So I'm thinking there is something wrong with the app.,Spotify
Positive,"Really good! A wide verity of music, but a little expensive.",Spotify
Positive,This app os amazing. DEFINITELY worth the downloading time. They have almost any song on there. Plus my personal favorite 'She Bad' by Cameron Dallas. You should totally get it.,Spotify

Other then that it's a five star app and I'm greatly confused why there is less then three stars. Also, If more songs could be added on. Some songs I know are not on Spotify. Like ""Buy the Stars,"" by Marina and the Diamonds. Or maybe I'm not looking hard enough? Either way, it would be nice to have updates and more songs. But still, five stars to you creator's of Spotify!",Spotify

Positive,"Ha.... I'm NOT the one to be rating this app. I'm so bent on preserving cell phone battery power that I find it hard to sit back and enjoy the tunes. In fact I've only used the app once, the day it was downloaded. So far... I've only one band that I've clicked to follow. MUSE. The evening the app was downloaded into my phone I did enjoy the shuffling of the different MUSE songs. The few advertisements played through without me really noticing them. (SORRY Ad Agencies) So it's just kinda like a radio station that plays only one group. hahaha. Though, I'm sure that will change as soon as more groups are listed in my favorites.  There wasn't any stuttering effect or pauses due to band width issues. And sounded pretty good with earphones on. So with my limited knowledge of these things, take this 5 star rating with a grain of salt.",Spotify

Positive,It doesn't crash and plays outrageously good quality songs.,Spotify
Positive,"Good in ""freebe"" mode, but you need to pay the price for the storage on your device.",Spotify
Positive,"I must begin by saying I am your avid music junkie! If one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment I'd be infamous by now.  I began using Spotify per word of mouth when I was overheard verbally destroying Pandora. I paid for whatever Pandora markets their non free service as. It was a waste of hope and money. After a few skips (mind you these skips are more than a free Pandora user) I ran into the same skip limit as if I didn't shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips. The tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot. Nearing the end Spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what I heard I thought GREAT!, and I gave it a shot!  GREAT; because now I have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely, no fuss or gimmicks (this is with Premium, after the fail of Pandora free and paid services, I figured I'd start from the top with Spotify and see if slopes or avalanches downhill) and to me that was BLISS! With a wide variety of music I cannot live without daily ranging from Acoustic UK Pop Bands, to Old School Hip Hop KINGS such as KRS-One, Audio Two, and the legendary Wu-Tang Clan to our Modern Day (I Guess This Is What We Call) Rap Music, to my rock band faves like AFi and Blink 182, to Beyonce and Katy Perry for the softer Pop Music feel for the kids ears and Reggae and 60's & 70's KINGS and Queens of Soul Music, I can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and I LOVE THAT! I even have French rappers and singers songs, Idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention. That's what made Spotify so GREAT to me I have exactly 20 Playlists with over 1700 songs, and I created all the playlists to my liking and ALL available offline for my enjoyment anywhere. I can skip endlessy, I can jump to another playlist whenever I feel the desire and that's how music should be enjoyed! So why the Ehh?...  Ehh; with all the above praise that I will not recant, in fact I can ad more to it, there is a bummer to Spotify. Unbeknownst to me, the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory. Being that at that time I had the app installed on both my iPod and iPhone I never paid attention to it. But after tossing the Pod I noticed with my iPhone that Spotify was using up 4.5 GBs of the allotted 6.3 GBs. There weren't enough photos, games, and apps to remove to clear up space. My resolve was to purchase a tablet I know that has external storage per MicroSD cards. I ended up with the Kindle Fire HDX 8 8 GB and purchased the 32 GB MicroSD card. My plan was to download Spotify move it to the MicroSD and never have to worry about external storage and Spotify clashing again. To my greatest disappointment and I mean grave disappointment at this point, it turned out that SPOTIFY CANNOT BE MOVED TO MY 32 GB MicroSD card! It was infuriating to be casual at the least ok.  Resentment; Spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is! If you cannot afford Premium the app is useless, and that's just based off the experiences I've read over on reviews from Mobile App users. If you do have Premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up. If I only knew Spotify unlike let's say Netflix, cannot be moved to the MicroSD card from my HDX 8 I probably would've gotten a bigger Kindle (external memory wise). What really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after Amazon's preinstalled entities we consumers of the HDX 8 8 GB start off with a mere 5.3 GB!  So how does one cope with the ups and downs of Spotify and external memory clashes? You grab your headphones, scroll your favorite Playlists you created, skip and scroll through your music freely, and be thankful! Why? Because it could always be worse.. (coughs) Pandora (coughs). In writing this review I see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes, may have lead to adverse feelings towards Spotify. But I do have to say this it is a superb application. I have it on my iPhone for on the go, for the home depends on where at home, it can be either the XBOX, the Smart TV, and now the HDX 8. You can't really beat or put a price on that, Spotify however did and it's only $12.99/month. What's that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? Yea I'll pass and will continue to pass the word on about Spotify. Hope you found this helpful, you will enjoy Spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor, Premium is the ONLY way to really get a full grasp on the application and it's features. If you claim to love music you NEED Spotify Premium you can't go wrong.",Spotify
Positive,It works very good and let's you listen to a bunch of music,Spotify
Positive,So good :):):::):::::))))::):):):):):):):):):):):):),Spotify
Positive,"It's great for the mix of music ,but for some of the songs it changes the words. Still is a good app.",Spotify

You can play ANY song from your play lists, turn your device to wide screen and you will see the song list. If you would like to listen to your purchased music, use a different app, this is a steaming music service. Couldn't be happier. Unless Spotify breaks itself or goes bankrupt, no more Pandora.",Spotify
Positive,So far so good has all the newest music plays clearly and is free the upgrade price isn't bad either...Will keep you posted,Spotify
Positive,Good choice of music !!!!,Spotify
Positive,Good on road trips if u have wifi,Spotify
Positive,This have a good selection of music and the album's are very organized. Every music I looked for is available. This is now my primary music app.,Spotify
Positive,"I first downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation and it worked perfectly. It let me create my own playlists with only my own hand-selected songs and it let me skip as often as I wanted and select whichever song I wanted with only a 30 second commercial interruption every 4 or 5 songs. When I went to install the app on my new 4th generation Kindle Fire HD, Amazon popped up with a message saying that the current version of the app is not compatible, but they have contacted the manufacturer and asked them to correct the problem. When this app works, it's absolutely awesome. For once, Amazon isn't to blame for this because it IS compatible with a lot of devices. I read a lot of complaints about this, but if people are dumb enough to give their credit card info to a company that auto charges after a free trial before they're even sure that the app works, then they shouldn't complain. Spotify gives you a 7-day free trial of their premium service with no credit card info needed. You only have to provide your credit card info when you sign up for the additional 30-day free trial, then it automatically charges you. People should know if this is compatible before they provide that info. Bottom line - it's an awesome app that needs to get its compatibility issues sorted out because it's one of the best music apps out there. There are tons of pre-made playlists, and more importantly - you don't have to listen to a whole lot of music that you don't want to like most radio apps. And though you have to be online and have occasional commercials for the free version, it's still worth it. The premium version is $9.99 a month and you can download songs so you can listen offline and have no ads. Still not a bad price considering all the songs you can get if you want to pay for it.  UPDATE----- Spotify has fixed their compatibility issues with the Kindle Fire 4th generation and the app is working perfectly for me again.",Spotify
Positive,Good stuff!,Spotify
Positive,This really a good app especially when in your car or shower or for party's,Spotify
Positive,"I would happily say that this app is EXTRAORDINARY it has everything u want and need in music Pros: All the music you LOVE Every single artist ever known (even if they aren't good) Make your own playlists Listen to whatever you want It awesome Keeps u updated on the new songs  Cons: You need premium to listen instead of shuffle play Explicit content (for all u kids out there....what would your parents think)  I recommend this app for everyone they has a kindle and you should download it NO CHARGE!!!",Spotify
Positive,Very good app many choices of music,Spotify
Positive,Its really really really really really really good,Spotify
Positive,"Good musica in english and spanish, but i couldn't find J-Pop, i found japanese band but any song likes me.",Spotify
Positive,It's music good... good enough for me,Spotify
Positive,Good,Spotify
Positive,Very great source for music and programming to listen to while you're at home or on the go. I do recommend that you use this only at home since it might run up your limited data plan. The sound quality is above CD quality and the service has a very good library. It beats filling up your phone with songs and ending up running out of space. Spotify does not have everything and sometimes they limit what you can listen to based where you are located because of those copyrights. I have the premium subscription because I hate the commercials in the middle of the listening sessions.,Spotify
Positive,"I get to listen to good music I wouldn't find by myself. Start to using it though, I expect it to know me better and realize the kind of songs I usually forward",Spotify

Positive,This app works so good I love it,Spotify
Positive,"Good app, lots of music. The ""Premium"" package seems to be a bit pricey, however. At $10 a month, it seems a little steep. Could it be that most people take the free version, so there aren't enough Premium contracts to pay the nut? I'm not an audiophile, so $10 is too rich for my blood.",Spotify
Positive,Great app! Lots of good songs!,Spotify
Positive,Good and cool to listen to,Spotify

Positive,App works really well on the kindle and can stream in really goodquality via Bluetooth to a receiver,Spotify
Positive,Good app very good Gestapo ever,Spotify
Positive,"I love that amazon has apps to download. The apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost",Spotify
Positive,I love it it's a good app,Spotify
Positive,"Pretty good choices. Really annoying that you can only skip so,many songs then u can no,longer skip but overall it's a good app",Spotify

Positive,"Love,love,love Spotify.Lots of good memories buried in all the music I've downloaded into my personal playlists!",Spotify
Positive,"I love this app. I put it on my phone first, but I had so much music it was taking up all the room on my phone. I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version. Either way, you have access to lots of great music from your favorite artists.",Spotify
Positive,Great for listening to your favorite tunes and discovering new ones as well,Spotify
Positive,"Listening to music on demand has never been better than it is with Spotify. The app not only provides access to thousands of classic tracks, but it provides great recommendations for music you might like based on your listening history. Highly recommended!",Spotify

Positive,This app is amazing and you don't even have to get a premium account to get access to great music!,Spotify
Positive,"I love this app! It's runs great, and has all the song I'm looking for. The only severe flaw to this app would be that it needs WiFi for everything! You can't listen to any of the music if you don't have WiFi. Besides that great app!!",Spotify
Positive,"Great app, I'm very happy!",Spotify
Positive,"Great app, has every kind of music that you like. You can find a lot of great songs that you would not have found before. Also you can listen to old music or new music.",Spotify
Positive,"Spotify is great, and I do have a Premium account for greater mobile listening and no ads. My only complaint is that for unknown playlists (such as one I made) is hard for friends of mine to find unless I send them the playlist. Small complaint, and I definitely love using Spotify.",Spotify
Positive,"There's a small issue I have a lot of times it will not allow tracks to be played or will say a track is playing, but I only hear silence. That and once it wouldn't let me share to Facebook (facebook specifically.) I haven't tried since. Great quality sound though, and I love the wide open variety. Wouldn't want an app that only has pop, rap and country :p love it",Spotify
Positive,"I just love spotlight premium I don't have to listen to ads and interrupt my listening they have all the great songs",Spotify
Positive,A great music channel.,Spotify
Positive,"I love this app, it is pretty great. The only fault i have is that it says i need wifi to listen tothe songs ive downloaded unless i get the upgrade. When i go to get the upgrade there is none. So this makes me mad a lil bc ive already deleted my old music app. But other than that its a great app and i love the way you can organize the music!",Spotify
Positive,"So far great all the music I love and can download and listen while at work, home, andon the go. I hope it does not change. We will see when I get back from Mexico.",Spotify
Positive,Great app!,Spotify
Positive,"I love this app, I really do. But I just have a song request. I would love it if you guys put the song Here Comes The Boom by Nelly. Otherwise GREATEST MUSIC APP EVER.",Spotify
Positive,Awesome you can make your own 60's and 70's playlists. Great!!!!,Spotify
Positive,Great,Spotify
Positive,"Love that I can download directly to my devices , unfortunately you have to pay for the feature, but the $0.99 for 3 months promo is a great deal! I Will gladly pay $9.99 a month afterwards to keep the paid benefits, which there area many of!!",Spotify
Positive,"Great for listening to a variety of music. You can easily search, and find, just about any song or artist that you like, then Spotify finds similar music for you. Also has a ton of browser options. I like to pick my music by what mood I'm in.",Spotify
Positive,Awesome app and such a great way to discover new music,Spotify
Positive,Great app. Love that it connects to FB and has a huge variety of music. Very affordable for the paid app as well. Love Spotify!!,Spotify
Positive,It's the greatest app ever you can make your own playlist and search any song and it is great for on the road if you have a hot spot.,Spotify
Positive,What a great app! But I'm still waiting for Lemonade!,Spotify
Positive,"I love this app, but it sends me 71 EMAILS EVERY DAY! One is 99 ways to listen to music, your favorite music based on your search history. Please only buy this app to listen to music! Don't sign in with your EMAIL unless you have to! I myself prefer RDIO It's a great app to listen to music to.",Spotify
Positive,I love everything about this app except for the premium. I bought premium at a great price of 99¢ for 3 months. But when I go to spotify when I'm in the car for example it says no internet connection and won't let me listen to music . So I pretty much bought premium for nothing.,Spotify
Positive,The music is great! Just be sure to listen to your fav music cuz then you can make a playlist!!! I definitely reccomend this!____________,Spotify
Positive,I use this on my Kindle fire. I love that I can see is to store my off-line music on my external SD card or on my internal storage. It's a great app and I'm very happy with it. Really enjoying my student pricing as well,Spotify
Positive,"The limitations levied on mobile devices intended to manipulate premium purchase are excessive- almost rendering it unusable. But if you're using pc or tablet, spotify basic is great. A competitor is needed to save them from self inflicted alienation of their own consumers, adds and offline mode are incentive enough for premium.",Spotify
Positive,This app is pretty great let's you listen to any music you want. But it also plays songs that arn't on your Playlist but in the same genre. If you get the whole pack thing that you have to pay for monthly then they only play the songs on your playlist.,Spotify
Positive,"Really great app, add your own specific music, listen to stations by the the artist or songs like pandora but smarter, and download music from spotify with a premium account. But one feature is that I wish you could pay for premium via amazom store, like a subscription. Other than that, its an awesome app for music.",Spotify
Positive,Access to pretty much any song imaginable at the drop of a hat with a $9.99 Spotify Premium membership is a great deal in my mind. This replaces all my long lost CD's and for a fraction of the price of buying songs individually. Five stars for the service and the app itself.,Spotify
Positive,"First my parents got and I was like what's this, oh that's cool then my sis got it she loved it. So you known I decided to try it. IT IS AMAZING. all the music is free and you just add it and go. It's great I RECOMMEND IT!!!!",Spotify
Positive,Spotify is the best download site for those who want a great site for downloading their favourite music.

Positive,"Best ever, great!",Spotify
Positive,I use it in other devices and the playlists are great!,Spotify
Positive,Great selection I like it a lot,Spotify
Positive,This is a great app to have when looking for different music,Spotify
Positive,This app has lots of great music however I'm in a dead zone so if I'm not in my house where I have Wi-Fi I can't listen to it which means running and other outdoor activities are very quiet. It tells me to update to premium so I can use it offline but when I search for the premium I can't find it. How can I update to premium if it's not available?,Spotify
Positive,"Coolest app of all time for shure Great selection,you can make your own playlist. Defenently recommend it to anyone.",Spotify
Positive,"Apple is catching up to Spotify, but I'm sticking with this music service. Great music and one way to keep the industry from imploding. For me, Spotify seems to have slightly better transmission clarity and a more user-friendly interface.",Spotify
Positive,I listen in the morning and afternoon at work. Great selection and I enjoy it better than the other like services. You can skip as often as you like and don't need to give a song a thumbs up or down. I enjoy the different selection and the updates so I'm not hearing the same songs over and over. It's worth it.,Spotify
Positive,Awesome app! Great for when your bored ! I'm in love with the app!!!______________ I recommend that you get this app!!!!,Spotify
Positive,"Spotify is a great app for anybody who likes music. It's got a massive selection of genres and artists for all tastes, and it's all free if you don't mind listening to a couple minutes of advertising every now and then. I've got the app on both my iPad and Kindle Fire.",Spotify
Positive,Great App. Highly Recommend!!,Spotify
Positive,"Absolutley love spotify. Some songs arent on here but for the most part they are! Great radio stations to, love it better than pandora cuz no adds!!",Spotify
Positive,"I really enjoy being able to listen to any song I want anytime and if you don't have premium, the advertisements aren't that consistent ( as in not every song), really great app.",Spotify
Positive,"I love Spotify. They have some great playlists, convenient noise while I work to party playlists and road trip mixes. Not to mention the fact that you can make your own. :)",Spotify
Positive,Works great and very little problems.,Spotify
Positive,I like this music app because it gives me a greater variety of what to listen to and on premium I don't even need Internet connection to play all my favorite Playlists,Spotify
Positive,"I love it!!! I use music to communicate and stay in touch with emotions, the selections on Spotify are great",Spotify
Positive,"It's a very easy app to use, and I like the fact that it has a Discover section. I found most of the bands I love through this! It has a great variety of songs for every genre, and you can make playlists to categorize all of your songs.",Spotify
Positive,Such a great music player. The customized playlists by users is awesome because they get updated. I especially love my weekly discover playlist.,Spotify
Positive,"I love Spotify, I have it downloaded on multiple devises so I can always have it right by me. Great for those who love always listening to music.",Spotify
Positive,"It's a great app and has a variety of music, the only reason I didn't rate it five stars is because about every three songs an add comes on asking you to get spotify premium, it sometimes even says it in the middle of the song!",Spotify
Positive,"This is the best! I love it. It works great on everything I have. I use it on a kindle fire, iPhone, iPad, amazon echo, amazon dot, and iPod! It is amazing",Spotify
Positive,Great music,Spotify
Positive,Great app to find great music airing now and treasures from the past. __,Spotify
Positive,Guards are a rad small otherwise great product,Spotify
Positive,"Great app !! So glad Kindle has this. Would recommend everybody to download and use it. User friendly, easy to navigate through. So far not disappointed !!! Thanks for bringing this great music app to Kindle users !! ____",Spotify
Positive,The student discount for premium is great! I've never had any trouble with this music service and I'm also discovering new music all the time.,Spotify
Positive,"Great music. They should let it be free, and keep all songs saved on phone, tablet,kindle etc.",Spotify
Positive,This app is great if you love music like me and If you do I would highly recommend it,Spotify
Positive,Spotify is amazing. It's our go-to app for playing music in our home. I don't even mind the occasional ads! And I love being able to access play lists that other people have made. What a great way to share music!,Spotify
Positive,"Great app for music lovers. Tons of music, from the old and esoteric to the contemporary, singles to full albums.",Spotify
Positive,"Spotify is great! There are few songs I cannot find and a wide selection of music. I've listened to music I never would have thought I liked, thanks to Spotify.",Spotify
Positive,"It's more than just the choices of music which is outstanding. It is also the equalizer, the browsing tools and other niceties that make it a pleasure. The ability to make your own playlists and share them is also a big facet of why I enjoy it. Truly a great service",Spotify
Positive,"This is a great app so far. I am able to find all the artists and music that I am interested in easily and quickly. The sound is great and I can't believe that all this is from a free app. The few ads that broadcast periodically are worth enduring for the quality of this service.........and, IT'S FREE!! Way to go Spotify!",Spotify
Positive,"Greatest music app on the planet! I started off as a free user and loved Spotify even then. . . however, I have to admit that I am now a Spotify Premium user (student) and love it even more. The app works great, the Discover Weekly playlists are usually awesome and I don't regret paying for it at all. What I like about it, is that I download almost any song that I want to my devices, and then listen to it anywhere until I get play it to death and find a new favorite song. I would recommend this app to pretty much anyone, but if you're like like me you might get hooked and not be able to get away.  *One important note: Spotify usually has clean radio edits of pretty much all songs but right now it doesn't have a general filter/ setting that you can use to filter. If you are offended by profanity or worried about objectionable content (and don't want to monitor it closely) that might pose a problem because beside looking at each individual song I don't know a workaround.",Spotify
Positive,"This is the best station I use! I never use anything else!!!! It's got great quality audio, and I use it all the time!!!!",Spotify
Positive,Easy to use.... Great music!,Spotify
Positive,"Great way to listen to listen to music without having to pay any thing. I wish it had a sleep timer like Pandora. If I wasn't already paying for Pandora, I would probably pay for this and get it commercial free. But the commercials are not long or frequent. And paying gives you the option to listen offline.",Spotify
Positive,The only thing that is not the best is 30 second ads but things like Pandora do that.Other than that it's great you can make playlists and share them to everyone and follow your favorite artists and listen to their songs. I totally recommend getting it over so many other things. Hope you enjoy it just as much as I do!,Spotify
Positive,I enjoy all the free up-to-date music the commercials don't bother me I love it great app!!!,Spotify
Positive,Great selection of all genres of music.,Spotify
Positive,"It's very great, you can listen to music while playing or on another app and you have your own playlist.",Spotify
Positive,Spotify is a great app for trips and even gaming!,Spotify
Positive,Great experience with the spotify app the music plays crisp and smooth plus you get to checkout other playlist and remixes of music.,Spotify
Positive,"Great choices for music genres, radio, and new music. Not interrupted too much for announcements, etc. I use Spotify Music more often because of the variety of music and search for music I want to look for.",Spotify
Positive,"Like I said ,this is awesome! It has a great selection of songs. And I bet you will find some new favorites to. I definitely recommend getting this if you love music! __",Spotify
Positive,Great you can get any genre you want,Spotify
Positive,"Easy to use,very few repeat songs on playlists to playlists. Some great songs that I forgot were out there and are not on other sites. By not perfect. Searching playlists for that next song can take a while. And genres can be a little confused.",Spotify
Positive,"Great app I have too admit,  but the stupid ads get so annoying especially when in the middle of your song.",Spotify
Positive,"I think Spotify Music is a great app and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants their own custom playlist but doesn't want to pay for the music. Spotify has all the songs I love and I really enjoy having this app, it's similar to Pandora, but with Spotify the music playing is all you're choice. I hope that my review was helpful, thank you!",Spotify
Positive,"The selection of music is great, but there are unrelenting commercials that prevent you from listening to the music",Spotify
Positive,"quite possibly the best app for music. I am a premium member so I get to listen to whatever I want, when I want with no adds or added songs. Great selection and I dont think I could live without",Spotify
Positive,Been a huge fan ever since Sony jumped on board. I love the &#34;artist radio&#34; as a great way to discover similar artists with great albums. I also love to see companies adopt 3rd party solutions (reminds me of the Windows XP days).,Spotify
Positive,"I think it a great app except when I want to listen to the album consecutively, it won't let me. I have to listen in the random mode. I wanted to become a premium member, but there isn't any easy way to do that. If I could have figured that out Spotify would have gotten the high five.",Spotify
Positive,"Spotify is great for listening to your favorite music and discovering new music. Making your own playlists is a snap, and the radio option is pretty snazzy too. I love Spotify more than any other music app I've tried.",Spotify
Positive,"Got for my Kindle Fire. Invested in family Premium, now it's perfect for the gym. I love Spotify and the app is great on Kindle.",Spotify
Positive,"This app works perfectly well, and I love it! The music they have is great, even though they don't have Taylor Swift songs. Spotify Premium is better, but even if you don't go premium this app works awesome.",Spotify
Positive,Great app. If you enjoy music at all its awesome to have. Take your music everywhere! You can make your own playlists. Totally worth downloading.,Spotify
Positive,"I have been using Spotify for almost a year now, and I LOVE it! The quality is great, and premium is affordable. You can find the bands you love, and new ones. Can't go wrong with Spotify.",Spotify
Positive,Just love this app works great,Spotify
Positive,Great!,Spotify
Positive,"The song selections are great and I really live Spotify, but when I hit shuffle on a playlist, it plays one song and then stops working.",Spotify
Positive,This is a great app I love it. You choose all the music you like and save them to your library and/or playlist. Very simple app and easy to use. I listen everyday. Take I tunes music times 100,Spotify
Positive,"It's so nice to be able to get a complete album instead of a ""one-time"" song here and there by a beloved Artist. Great Service much loved.",Spotify
Positive,"So many options that it took a little bit to get used to the interface, but I listen all the time on my tablet and its great.",Spotify
Positive,"My son uses the app and said he can get all the music he wants or needs. I downloaded the app and discovered it required a ""registration"" to run. I don't like apps that track users or require registration so I never registered and therefore it is non functional on my tablet. As for my son, he thinks its great!",Spotify
Positive,"This is a great app, but on android to play music you have to click ""Shuffle"" to play music, but on iOS, you can play a song right away. I'd put five stars if you could play music right away on android.",Spotify
Positive,"This is a great app. I was looking for a karaoke track and they have everything! I can even use it offline! ( since I have a kindle) So, great selection a d very helpful.",Spotify
Positive,Great way to listen to music. Not a lot of commercials so you get to listen more.,Spotify
Positive,"Great selection, love to find other playlists already complete/created, like to be able to just switch to the radio as well!",Spotify
Positive,Great app and music selection,Spotify
Positive,Best app for listening to whatever you want to hear no matter what the genre. Great discount for college students as well!,Spotify
Positive,This is such a great app! The song you search for is the song you get! You also get a choice of different performers for the particular song you pick. The ads are short and few and far between. It's so satisfying to get the song you want when you want it!,Spotify
Positive,Works great!! Have made a playlist for the very first time using my Kindle Fire!! To hear all my Favorite songs! Of my youth!!,Spotify
Positive,It's Great! It has all your favorite music no matter what genre!,Spotify
Positive,"I miss the lyrics that the desktop version offered, but I guess they removed this also__ otherwise perfect...Great job..",Spotify
Positive,"GREAT!!! It's amazing and prime is so worth it. But it's shuffle is not the best buts still incredible variety of music, I totally recommend that you download this app!!!!!!",Spotify
Positive,This app started out great. I used it all the time but ever since I updated it they require you to upgrade to premium just so you can turn off shuffle mode and I think that is absolutely ridicules. Do not download this app.,Spotify
Positive,"With Amazon Alexa its great....play what you want, create your own playlists and daily suggested stations. Love it !!!",Spotify
Positive,Great selection of music. Hate that it's shuffle play only and that random songs play based on your other selections. I wish premium was cheaper so I could play anything I wanted. I really like that there's a vast selection of kid songs for my 2 and 6 yr old children.,Spotify
Positive,Sporting is a great way to find new music. Even the ads are not that intrusive and are a small price to pay for a great service. I would absolutely recommend this app to any music lover out there.,Spotify
Positive,Great. Been able to do homework and sleep better than ever before!______________________________________,Spotify
Positive,Great music streaming app! Wide array of song and artist selections and decent playlists for many different occasions.,Spotify

Positive,"OMG this thing is tots great, I can listen to my ham, my fallout boy, my mcr, and my 21 pilots all in one playlist!! Totally rate it 5+ stars.",Spotify
Positive,"The best music app ever. This is amazing because you can pick your own music for a play list. All the top hits-here. All the 70s music-here. And, great for the holidays. Only problem is that there is commercials A LOT. Otherwise, BEST MUSIC APP EVER. Maybe even better than Pandora! ;)",Spotify
Positive,"Great to use, make a playlist of all of your favorite songs!",Spotify
Positive,"Spotify is great for music- it's like a mix of Pandora and Soundcloud. You can both listen to individual songs (and even put them in playlists) but also listen to specific ""stations"" for songs, like on Pandora. Overall, freakin awesome.",Spotify
Positive,"Still trying to poke around to figure this out, but so far it seems like a great music app.",Spotify
Positive,"Used to be really great before they switched it to where only premium members get to pick songs. Now with the skip limits and the only allowing shuffle play, it might as well be just like Pandora. Only Pandora has less ads.",Spotify
Positive,great variety..listen to it everyday,Spotify
Positive,All the different music choices and the great selection of artists is what makes spotify a must have. Plus I don't have to make my own playlists because a lot of people have taste in music like mine.,Spotify
Positive,Great music! I've been listening on my smart phone while I work at home. I have the option of listening to many eras and genres. So glad I got the tip from Starbucks to sign up with Spotify.,Spotify
Positive,"Spotify is great in the sense that you can make your own playlists, however, you should be able to choose the song you want to listen to instead of having to shuffle and hope you get the song you want to listen to.",Spotify
Positive,It's GREAT :) you can listen to all sorts of music I enjoy it and recommend. The only thing is you need premium to listen offline.,Spotify
Positive,"The app great, but it constantly freezes at random or as soon as you go any other tab.",Spotify
Positive,The app is a little laggy and there isn't very much Eminem songs on it but other than that its great,Spotify
Positive,All works great. __,Spotify
Positive,"such a great app. i use it as often as i can, the only downside being that i don't get enough money to pay for premium so i can't do it as much as i want to sadly but all is well. it also helps me find a lot of new music which i'm very thankful for. well recommended.",Spotify
Positive,Consistently great. Easy to use and intuitive. Great for making playlists and then building on them with Spotify's intuitive suggestions.,Spotify
Positive,"Great music, but the app keeps freezing on my Kindle so I need to turn my device completely off to stop the music. I guess I will stay with Pandora.",Spotify
Positive,"This is a really great app and I highly recommend it. In some ways it is better than Pandora, but if you are someone like me and loves music than I would definitely chose spotify over Pandora.",Spotify
Positive,this app is a great app for people who love music it has all the genres you can think of and more you can create you own play lists and share them I only have the free version but it's one of the best apps I have so if your looking for a great app for music get this one,Spotify

Positive,Great app. You get a 7-Day free trial. I highly recommended this app for anybody that wants music.,Spotify
Positive,Great selection!,Spotify
Positive,"Spotify was a great app and worked seemlesly on my BlackBerry Z30, until the new update. Music used to play steady even after I went under the tunnel on the subway. Now the music breaks down at times like a scratched CD and cuts off.",Spotify
Positive,"Its great but, I can't play it offline... I can't figure out how to get it to work offline...",Spotify

Positive,I love that I can create multiple playlists of music based upon tempo or theme. It's like have access to multiple CDs. Great app. Just wish I could afford a premium subscription to get rid of ads. So far I like this much more than Pandora.,Spotify
Positive,I love this app... Works great a few artist have not gone here but I can find them other ways,Spotify
Positive,It is great I love it so much_________________________________________________________,Spotify
Positive,"Well designed user experience and great catalogue of music, however desperately needs Chromecast support. Also, needs to add support for up to 5 synced devices because the cost is bordering on too high. Strongly considering the Google Play Music streaming service but for now the catelogue is not as extensive.",Spotify
Positive,"Spotify Music is a great way to listen to music for me because I get to listen to artists and albums, or create a playlist of my favorite songs, and it's perfect for my tablet as well.",Spotify

Positive,It's great,Spotify
Positive,"I love it, I was spending anywhere from $20 to $25 a month on music with I tunes, over what my budget allowed, I love that I pay one payment a month and can download all the music I want, it is also great in that it is easy to browse and discover new music and new artist.",Spotify
Positive,"I love using Spotify! Even though I don't have the premium yet, it's still great when you're using the free version. The only downside is not being able to save music for offline use, otherwise I would use this 24/7",Spotify
Positive,Great app. Lots of music to choose from. If you have Spotify premium its the best music app in my opinion,Spotify
Positive,"My favorite go to app for music, if you want ad free, premium is the way to go and the offline mode is great when out and about no internet needed to enjoy.",Spotify
Positive,"Now, when I first got the app about two years ago or so, it was a different app. You could listen to the songs you wanted and save them to listen to later, and listen to whatever, as long as you had WiFi (unless you had premium), and listen to sponsored apps every handful of songs. It was great.  Now days, ads cut off the ending of songs, it crashes, freezes up, and you really need a premium account if you want to do anything. It seems as though they are more desperate for money, and I get that. The thing is, 10 dollars is something a lot of people might not be able to pay, yet they want to listen to music too.  It's made me happy in the past, but lately it's just disappointing me.",Spotify
Positive,This is a great app to listen to music on and for me it'd better then Pandora bc up can make your own playlists and choose what songs u want to listen too and I just luv it!!!!____,Spotify
Positive,"Not only can you have access to all the artists, albums and songs you love, you can also find new music; great stuff that might not be getting air play on your local radio stations.",Spotify
Positive,"Spotify was great until you need to get premium to listen to what ever song you wanted instead of the shuffle. It was my favorite app, but I have to resort to YouTube now to listen to whatever song I want to hear.",Spotify
Positive,Greatest music platform available.,Spotify
Positive,Sometime the ads can be a glitch but besides that it's great!,Spotify
Positive,"It works great, but, you have to have WiFi for it to play music. Plz make it so you dont have to use WiFi.",Spotify
Positive,Spotify is great! It has most of the songs you want to hear and you can make your own library of songs!,Spotify
Positive,"Great platform, all the music I want and that I didn't even know I wanted.",Spotify
Positive,Spotify is great. It has all the music I listen to and more!,Spotify
Positive,best music app. great selection of music,Spotify
Positive,I recommend this because it is great for researching on the web and listening to music in one device instead of using other technology for one and having to use another device for the other,Spotify
Positive,"It's a great app with a lot of great songs, but my main problem is when it says ñand now the next 30 mins of music are ad-free thanks to the following sponsor&#34;, it never loafs the ad lately.",Spotify

Positive,"Get it, you won't be disappointed. Great way to find out about new music, then go BUY it so the band's you like can keep doing what they do!!!",Spotify
Positive,I love this app it is awesome how your able to listen to the music you love easily and your able to make your own playlists. Such a great app,Spotify
Positive,"I have Nuance Dragon Assistant (version 3.1.30.7) installed on my Windows 8.1 PC. Dragon Assistant gives you the freedom to use your voice to control or get answers from your computer and can stream millions of songs for free through the Spotify desktop application. If you have Spotify Premium, Dragon can also learn your Spotify playlists and starred items. That's what got me try Spotify and to eventually upgrade to Spotify Premium.  I have become a big fan of Spotify Premium. It has simplified my life - no more need for buying music or trying to get copies of my music library installed on multiple devices and platforms. I have this Spotify app installed on both my Kindle Fire HD and HDX. It works great on both devices. I also have Spotify Connect installed on my Fire TV and stream from this Spotify app.",Spotify

Positive,"I love Spotify. Even when you don't by Premium, which is still a great deal, seeing as how its pretty cheep, its still a wonderful app. Especially since it doesn't download onto your device, so it doesn't take up memory on the device.",Spotify
Positive,Its great that you can choose which songs u hear but for my kindle fire it won't let me upgrade for premium which made me mad otherwise great app better than pandora,Spotify
Positive,Ok I love app but this new update is really ruining it for me. first I can't select what song I want to play anymore and second it keeps throwing suggested songs into my playlist. otherwise it's a great app,Spotify
Positive,Great selection of music. Quality sound.,Spotify

Positive,Spotify is on the spot with great music. It is my top(sify) choice for music.,Spotify
Positive,Greatest app in the world!!! I can listen to ____,Spotify
Positive,They play great Music thank you! !!,Spotify
Positive,Great app. The only thing I think should change is that you should be able to listen to the songs in whatever order you want without having to purchasing Spotify premium .,Spotify
Positive,"I love that I can Spotify on my phone, laptop, desktop and pc. I love that it gives me a greater control over what music is playing.",Spotify
Positive,"Connects very well with all my devices, works great with Alexa",Spotify
Positive,"I hated the idea of having to pay to listen to music. I tried the free week and thought it was great. When the sale came around for 3 months for just a dollar, I said why not. I use it every day now.",Spotify
Positive,Great music all the time. Seems to be getting more songs the longer I listen,Spotify
Positive,Great app for music and extremely user friendly!,Spotify

Positive,"I have been listening to Spotify premium for the past 4 years. I since stoped buying music, I discover great artists every day and enjoy the music I love. I never looked back!",Spotify
Positive,Have really enjoyed it. A really great app for all kinds of music and podcasts. Even with the ads it terrific.,Spotify
Positive,"I love this app. I don't use Pandora anymore because of this app. I love how you can create your own playlists. Great app, even better since its FREE!!!",Spotify
Negative,"Latest update is no longer available in Malaysia. Spotify is available in Malaysia, I have a premium subscription with them through my telco, and I can get the latest versions on my other Android and iOS tablets. However on my Blackberry Passport and LeapFrog Epic who can only get apps from the Amazon AppStore, Amazon is denying me the ability to download the update. Very disappointed. I've already contacted Amazon Customer Service and they told me to contact Spotify, who is appearing to be clueless as to what has happened.  I'd have given it 5 stars, but denying me off the update, even for something I'm paying monthly for, is just plain wrong.",Spotify
Negative,"I've never paid for spotify so my one and only gripe is that it sucks the life out of my data plan... I'm not sure if paying for it would solve that issue but if $10/month would do it, I'd start tomorrow! As long as you expect ads, this is the best free music server out there.",Spotify
Negative,"It's nice to have an app, but the web player seems to work better. Also, on the web I don't have ads due to spotify rewarding me for helping with bug fixes or being member since prebeta, or something. It wasn't really specified as to why I shouldn't have ads with my account, but I still get th on mobile app.  Another issue is that I can't find an option to use better sound quality when on WiFi. I get the crap audio on 4g eating up my data cap, but I have a nice phone and would like better quality music when it's viable through high-speed internet.  The app kinda sucks, and the web player still seems to be the best option across most platforms, but at least they thought of us Amazon users.",Spotify
Negative,I had had Pandora before but it was giving me some issues so I decided to download spotify. It has proven to be much better because not only can I listen to the &#34;radio&#34; but I can also make my own playlists and listen to whatever I want.,Spotify
Negative,"I first downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation and it worked perfectly. It let me create my own playlists with only my own hand-selected songs and it let me skip as often as I wanted and select whichever song I wanted with only a 30 second commercial interruption every 4 or 5 songs. When I went to install the app on my new 4th generation Kindle Fire HD, Amazon popped up with a message saying that the current version of the app is not compatible, but they have contacted the manufacturer and asked them to correct the problem. When this app works, it's absolutely awesome. For once, Amazon isn't to blame for this because it IS compatible with a lot of devices. I read a lot of complaints about this, but if people are dumb enough to give their credit card info to a company that auto charges after a free trial before they're even sure that the app works, then they shouldn't complain. Spotify gives you a 7-day free trial of their premium service with no credit card info needed. You only have to provide your credit card info when you sign up for the additional 30-day free trial, then it automatically charges you. People should know if this is compatible before they provide that info. Bottom line - it's an awesome app that needs to get its compatibility issues sorted out because it's one of the best music apps out there. There are tons of pre-made playlists, and more importantly - you don't have to listen to a whole lot of music that you don't want to like most radio apps. And though you have to be online and have occasional commercials for the free version, it's still worth it. The premium version is $9.99 a month and you can download songs so you can listen offline and have no ads. Still not a bad price considering all the songs you can get if you want to pay for it.  UPDATE----- Spotify has fixed their compatibility issues with the Kindle Fire 4th generation and the app is working perfectly for me again.",Spotify
Negative,"This is a very good app,I've used it for about 2 years now, my only issue is how often there's an ad but that won't stop you from singing in the shower!",Spotify
Negative,"There's a small issue I have a lot of times it will not allow tracks to be played or will say a track is playing, but I only hear silence. That and once it wouldn't let me share to Facebook (facebook specifically.) I haven't tried since. Great quality sound though, and I love the wide open variety. Wouldn't want an app that only has pop, rap and country :p love it",Spotify
Negative,"This app is very useful, I love it! They give you a month or so of free premium. This app even helps youcfind new music! My only issue with this app is after your free premium, you can't listen to music offline without getting premium -Derpy",Spotify
Negative,"I rather enjoy this music app. Is better than any other, in terms of variety. The ability to follow others and listen to their playlists tops the cake for me. I love me music, and listen to different styles depending on my mood. Only issue is that I am so very poor at remembering song artists, song names, etc.........this is a blessing.",Spotify
Negative,"Spotify is by far one of the best music apps out there. I haven't had any issues with the functionality, and the library is extensive. I am finding all the music I had with Google play plus some. Would certainly recommend giving this one a try.",Spotify
Negative,"Amazing. I have been using Spotify since 2012 and have never had any issues. The app is reliable, convenient, and allows flexibility. I have broadened my taste in music and pursued an interest in playing the guitar simply through finding more and more artists that appeal. Kills Pandora or any other radio program",Spotify
Negative,"This is a free app, so it's hard to complain too much. I downloaded it for my Kindle Fire HD. It loads quickly and has all the features you need for Spotify on a tablet. Unfortunately, there are a few playback issues. Three main examples:  1. Songs often skip or have annoying pops. 2. When using the shuffle feature for an artist, the app seems to play the same few songs over and over (and mostly from the artist's most recent albums). 3. The app often stops playing music when using another program on the Kindle. For example, if I am browsing the internet, the app sometimes quits halfway through a song and has to be restarted.  Overall, this app has some challenges to overcome, but it gets the job done most of the time. After all, if I'm listening from my Kindle Fire, I'm not exactly in search of a premier audio listening experience.",Spotify
Negative,"Aside from the mobility issue since you need premium to listen without WiFi or data, the fact you can't play specific songs on android or Apple phones, it's the perfect music app for kindle or stationary devices like pc.",Spotify
Negative,"I have no issues with this app. It's easy to navigate, saves my recently played songs and playlists, runs in the background as I work on other things. I like it better than the desktop version.",Spotify
Negative,The BEST music app. The only issue for me is that I am cheap and don't want to pay for prime and thus off line use.,Spotify
Negative,"No complaints good app, haven't had any issues on my Kindle fire__",Spotify
Negative,We love it. No issues.,Spotify
Negative,Excellent variety of music....I especially love the 'Word' playlist. Not many technical issues and the layout is easy to use.,Spotify
Negative,Absolutely no complaints. This app is awesome and I've yet to have any problems with it. I use it on a daily basis and never encounter Any issues. Great music selection also!! I've yet to not find a song I'm looking for.,Spotify
Negative,Love this app. My only issue would be is to change up the commercials a bit. They are redundant. But I listen everyday. Love it !!!,Spotify
Negative,"I've US d Spotify for sale me years now, and it hasn't ceased to satisfy me. I definitely would recommend this app to any music lovers. It does require internet access to listen to music, but that's not much of an issue.",Spotify
Negative,would give it 5 stars but been having issues with the free version as of late. it has stopped playing a few times and when the ads play sometimes it completely quits,Spotify
Negative,"Has a few issues on Kindle, but mostly works well. The Spotify service itself is great.",Spotify
Negative,Love Spotify but on a Kindle... LOTS of issues,Spotify
Negative,App is great. My wife and I share a subscription and both have the app. We've never had any issues with it and it's very user friendly.,Spotify
Negative,"I have been using Spotify for six years as my go to listening app. Spotify has all of the music you have in your collections and new music that is currently on the radio. I have not had any major issues or complaints about Spotify. Even though I use the Free version, I still haven't reached the point that the interruptions from the commercials are that big of a deal that I need to change add the upgrade. I get to pick all the music I want to listen to and let Spotify do the rest. Sometimes when I switch between different WIFI devices I may have to restart my computer to operate Spotify. It is a small price to pay for unlimited music that I can taylor to my every mood.",Spotify
Negative,Love this app! No issues at all!,Spotify
Negative,"Works great, no major issues.",Spotify
Negative,While I'm love the music quality and selection on this app I have random connection issues with it and sometimes the sound glitches out fir half a song. I can't seem to find a reason fir this.,Spotify
Negative,This app is amazing but they need to fix the issue you listen to a song but a lot of ads out of nowhere,Spotify
Negative,"Only minor issue is that the app halfway opens to where I can't see anything but the home screen, but I can still select songs and what not. Otherwise, I love it",Spotify
Negative,Works great. No issues. Would recommend.,Spotify
Negative,"This is a great app with tons of music, only issue is that the ui can be confusin",Spotify
Negative,Does what it is supposed to do without any issues. The app is pretty close to perfection.,Spotify
Negative,"Ha.... I'm NOT the one to be rating this app. I'm so bent on preserving cell phone battery power that I find it hard to sit back and enjoy the tunes. In fact I've only used the app once, the day it was downloaded. So far... I've only one band that I've clicked to follow. MUSE. The evening the app was downloaded into my phone I did enjoy the shuffling of the different MUSE songs. The few advertisements played through without me really noticing them. (SORRY Ad Agencies) So it's just kinda like a radio station that plays only one group. hahaha. Though, I'm sure that will change as soon as more groups are listed in my favorites.  There wasn't any stuttering effect or pauses due to band width issues. And sounded pretty good with earphones on. So with my limited knowledge of these things, take this 5 star rating with a grain of salt.",Spotify
Negative,Love this app. I use if all the time and have never had any issues with it,Spotify
Negative,"If you have spotify, then you will need this for your device. I have an LG tablet (Android) and I love it. Loads very fast, have not had a single issue yet",Spotify
Negative,"never has any issues, easy to use, great sound. awesome app",Spotify
Negative,"If you want to get this app, there are a few important things to know: 1.The last I checked, they do not have Taylor Swift songs, so I'm really sorry for all those Taylor Swift fans out there! I was also disappointed with that. 2. You can't play individual songs. Ok so this is how it works, you search a song and you can add it. That song you can now out in a playlist. A playlist is just where you can categorize songs. And when you see the list of all your songs, you can't just play one. You must shuffle play. I WAS REALLY UPSET WITH THIS!! RREEAALLY UPSET! 3. They don't have all songs, but they do have most. 4. I JUST WISH YOU DONT HAVE TO SHUFFLE PPLLAAYY! 5. There is way more to Spotify, like radio and stations and things like that THANKS FOR READING I HOPE YOU CAN EASILY MAKE YOUR DECISION (I hope Spotify reads this and fixes the shuffle play problem. I'm sorry Taylor Swift fans, I don't think Taylor Swift allows Spotify to use her songs, it's a money /business issue.  -thank you-",Spotify
Negative,"Cannot get any better, never had an issue with the app. Not slow, can find the songs I want to easily. As good as Spotify on a desktop or laptop.",Spotify
Negative,"The only issues i had were with internet. Im not old enough to pay for premium( ok, i just dont have a job yet) and my parents wont get me one D¡¡:",Spotify
Negative,Has a couple of issues but nothing is perfect and am completely thrilled with Spotify!,Spotify
Negative,"For a free music app this works wonderfully for me.the free version allows you to listen to unlimited music but the downside is that it WILL play ads and you DON'T have unlimited skips. Music quality is a big issue for me, but this app has the best quality I've ever had on a free app. The only thing I really dislike about it is the fact that you can't change the EQ on a kindle fire. I tap on it and gives me a warning saying something about different EQ settings can change volume level and then closes! Why can't I change the EQ?!? I can on my IPod!",Spotify
Negative,Spotif is a good service but Chrome cast has issues at times.,Spotify
Negative,"Since update no issues. Has almost every artist",Spotify
Negative,The only app I use for music. Never have an issue.,Spotify
Negative,"Awesome! Great music! Only issue is that not all songs from artist are available, but great otherwise :)",Spotify
Negative,"When I reopen my kindle, the spotify app says no internet, even though I am connected to my WiFi and other apps connect just fine. I have to turn wireless off and back on (on the kindle) to get spotify to connect. Major pain!",Spotify
Negative,"Kind of a pain to use. Too much retail interruptions  TuneIn Radio and BeyondPod far more user friendly",Spotify
Negative,Good app just a pain to figure out at first,Spotify
Negative,Whatever they did to this app for kindl made the sound horrible. Robotic. And the volume is very low compared to other music apps at same volume.,Spotify
Negative,Compared to prime music it's horrible. But for what it is by itself it's not bad. Used for years until I got prime,Spotify
Negative,"I must begin by saying I am your avid music junkie! If one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment I'd be infamous by now.  I began using Spotify per word of mouth when I was overheard verbally destroying Pandora. I paid for whatever Pandora markets their non free service as. It was a waste of hope and money. After a few skips (mind you these skips are more than a free Pandora user) I ran into the same skip limit as if I didn't shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips. The tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot. Nearing the end Spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what I heard I thought GREAT!, and I gave it a shot!  GREAT; because now I have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely, no fuss or gimmicks (this is with Premium, after the fail of Pandora free and paid services, I figured I'd start from the top with Spotify and see if slopes or avalanches downhill) and to me that was BLISS! With a wide variety of music I cannot live without daily ranging from Acoustic UK Pop Bands, to Old School Hip Hop KINGS such as KRS-One, Audio Two, and the legendary Wu-Tang Clan to our Modern Day (I Guess This Is What We Call) Rap Music, to my rock band faves like AFi and Blink 182, to Beyonce and Katy Perry for the softer Pop Music feel for the kids ears and Reggae and 60's & 70's KINGS and Queens of Soul Music, I can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and I LOVE THAT! I even have French rappers and singers songs, Idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention. That's what made Spotify so GREAT to me I have exactly 20 Playlists with over 1700 songs, and I created all the playlists to my liking and ALL available offline for my enjoyment anywhere. I can skip endlessy, I can jump to another playlist whenever I feel the desire and that's how music should be enjoyed! So why the Ehh?...  Ehh; with all the above praise that I will not recant, in fact I can ad more to it, there is a bummer to Spotify. Unbeknownst to me, the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory. Being that at that time I had the app installed on both my iPod and iPhone I never paid attention to it. But after tossing the Pod I noticed with my iPhone that Spotify was using up 4.5 GBs of the allotted 6.3 GBs. There weren't enough photos, games, and apps to remove to clear up space. My resolve was to purchase a tablet I know that has external storage per MicroSD cards. I ended up with the Kindle Fire HDX 8 8 GB and purchased the 32 GB MicroSD card. My plan was to download Spotify move it to the MicroSD and never have to worry about external storage and Spotify clashing again. To my greatest disappointment and I mean grave disappointment at this point, it turned out that SPOTIFY CANNOT BE MOVED TO MY 32 GB MicroSD card! It was infuriating to be casual at the least ok.  Resentment; Spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is! If you cannot afford Premium the app is useless, and that's just based off the experiences I've read over on reviews from Mobile App users. If you do have Premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up. If I only knew Spotify unlike let's say Netflix, cannot be moved to the MicroSD card from my HDX 8 I probably would've gotten a bigger Kindle (external memory wise). What really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after Amazon's preinstalled entities we consumers of the HDX 8 8 GB start off with a mere 5.3 GB!  So how does one cope with the ups and downs of Spotify and external memory clashes? You grab your headphones, scroll your favorite Playlists you created, skip and scroll through your music freely, and be thankful! Why? Because it could always be worse.. (coughs) Pandora (coughs). In writing this review I see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes, may have lead to adverse feelings towards Spotify. But I do have to say this it is a superb application. I have it on my iPhone for on the go, for the home depends on where at home, it can be either the XBOX, the Smart TV, and now the HDX 8. You can't really beat or put a price on that, Spotify however did and it's only $12.99/month. What's that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? Yea I'll pass and will continue to pass the word on about Spotify. Hope you found this helpful, you will enjoy Spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor, Premium is the ONLY way to really get a full grasp on the application and it's features. If you claim to love music you NEED Spotify Premium you can't go wrong.",Spotify
Negative,"If we were using useless Pandora we would not be able to listen to songs we can wont to listen to  Ttttttttttthhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaannnnnnnkkkk yyyyyyyooooooooouuuuuuuuu  Spotify",Spotify
Negative,"The sound quality is amazing and there are countless songs, however if you don't have premium, the music is not available without WiFi. You can listen to it with WiFi but it becomes useless when WiFi is unavailable. Pretty good though.",Spotify
Negative,App is useless without paying a ridiculous fee. Shuffle play? What a joke!,Spotify
Negative,I like this app but it's major problem is that endless you bought the premium it is basically useless. But still this is still a wonderful and amazing app.,Spotify
Negative,I used it on my phone and it was great.It is like so good better than pandora.It's kinda useless without preimem though.Although I still love it,Spotify
Negative,"If you dont have premium, this app is pretty much useless. You HAVE to keep it on shuffle and only have so many skips.",Spotify
Negative,this is the app to use for music...really exceeded my expectations and make pandora useless for me.,Spotify
Negative,"I had Spotify for a long time, not Premium, but I always liked it, now that it was updated you can't listen to the exact song that you want, it's stuck on shuffle permanently unless you pay to get Premium. Which is a terrible idea, come on Spotify.",Spotify
Negative,"Sound quality is seriously lacking. Maybe they do that to get you to sign up for the premium service, but the free service just isn't worth it. Navigation is terrible too.",Spotify
Negative,"All the music you could want in one place, even without premium the ads aren't terrible or long",Spotify
Negative,The update is terrible. It needs to change or I'm going elsewhere.,Spotify
Negative,"I love this app so much you can get so much free music, it's really crazy. They have such much music. They don't have Taylor swift though, which kind of sucks.",Spotify
Negative,"I can't figure out how to go premium, it sucks not app but that and u can't listen to it everywhere unless u got internet or data, but I guess other than its good.",Spotify
Negative,I have Spotify premium on my laptop but for some reason I can't load it on my android. I've tried 10 or more times and it will not work properly. Don't know what the problem is but it sucks not being able to take my music we it me.,Spotify
Negative,"I love this app, but then they had to ruin it. At first, you could listen to any song without premium, but now, you need premium of you want to pick a specific song to listen to. It sucks!!!",Spotify
Negative,"At the time of writing, this is simply the best music streaming app out there. There's a great selection, the search engine doesn't suck, and it's quite easy to use and get the hang of. If you have multiple devices you want to listen to your music on, this is a must-have app.",Spotify
Negative,Love it so much but it sucks you have to buy premium because I sometimes want to leave to go somewhere and can't listen to music,Spotify
Negative,I love spotify but it sucks when you want to play some james on the road but you have no WIFI and im not paying for it neither. But pretty good!,Spotify
Negative,love it but donÕt like the monthly payment.. I see they offer non existant customers a cheaper price to join but still charge loyal customers way more that sucks!!!!!!,Spotify
Negative,Omg so it is a good app but the new updated version absolutely sucks!!you can't play what you want please fix this sucks!!So dealeating unless fixed,Spotify
Negative,"Now you have to pay it sucks D: Whyy!? Finally I found the perfect app for music then I have to pay. This would be a five star review if not.",Spotify
Negative,Sporting is a good app to listen to but you can't listen to it without wifi and that sucks if they don't get a app that doesn't need wifi when your on the road then I will just delete the app,Spotify
Negative,I LOVE spotify but the new update sucks. U should be able to click on the song u want to listen to rather than have to wait for it to come on.,Spotify
Negative,Its ok when you have wifi on but it sucks when you want to play offline because there's not a way to get premium to keep playing music,Spotify
Negative,I love Spotify!! All the others really sucked!! I am an avid listener...,Spotify
Negative,You can't get certain songs and I don't want to pay to have music any where and the upgrade sucks,Spotify
Negative,"After last update I can no longer sign in through my Facebook account. Now all my play list are lost, sucks!",Spotify
Negative,It has all my favorite songs that I can play and enjoy...it just sucks that you have to have WiFi.........,Spotify
Negative,This app is AMAZING. PANDORA SUCKS AND YOU NEED TO GET THIS APP AND STOP READING THIS .right now. Really.,Spotify
Negative,"Streaming music is so fast on Spotify. Beats Google music or any of them. It downloads on kindles, androids, iPhones, and other devices. Except Xbox. Which sucks but oh well. I love this app. You pay 9 dollars a month but it's sonworth it. All new music is right on there and you can make playlist. As many as you want. It's so amazing. I love Spotify. And the streaming is great.",Spotify
Negative,"Like the title says, only one fault in the app. I can't get the offline music to stay offline. This sucks.",Spotify
Negative,If you buy premium this app is dope. If not it sucks. Especially if multiple ppl share an account. Dope be cheap. But premium.it's worth it.,Spotify
Negative,Spotify is arguably one of the best things that ever happened for music listeners and one of the worst for music artists. Artists make next to nothing. We're talking 1/100 of one cent per listen. Do the math and tell me how anyone can live off that. The only artists who can survive are superstars who make all their money from touring.,Spotify
Negative,I can't say that this is the worst or the best but it rocks for me at work and I pick it everytime!,Spotify
Negative,It's not the worst thing on the store.,Spotify
Negative,I love this app! It is easy to work. It is updated on music. The one thing I found not good was it doesn't have much Taylor Swift songs. It doesn't have bad blood. But that's a little thing so I give it 5/5 stars! GET IT NOW!,Spotify
Negative,This is a great and nice app because it let you listen to whatever you want to listen the only thing that is bad is that you cannot go to the previous song.,Spotify
Negative,I can listen to whatever I want and like when it comes to my favorites I can listen to them and I just love it and I get to block my teachers out in school while listening to music by Bryson Tiller trapsoul on this app thank you,Spotify
Negative,"I love this music app. It's the best. It has so many choices. There's - browse, many genres to choose from, the radio and the best yet listen to entire albums. It's awesome. Get it. Or at least give it a try. And it's free. There are ads, but, so...not that many. There is the option to upgrade to remove ads and whatever else.",Spotify
Negative,I am excited to have Spotify and to be able to choose whatever music I am in the mood for! Thank you.,Spotify
Negative,It's amazing I can listen to whatever I want even not on shuffle It is so good at hearing Harry styles and all the 1D songs and 1D people,Spotify
Negative,"Lots and lots of music to put you in whatever mood you to be in, or get out of or got back in time and relive the good old days!!! Music is the message and music is the cure!!!",Spotify
Negative,I love this app. I'm addicted to music and spotify is the best pusherman so far. As a musician I'm not so sure yet. Not everything is on here. And some stuff gets taken off sometimes for whatever reason. But out of all the music download/stream apps out there this is BY FAR THE BEST.,Spotify
Negative,"LOVE this app! It's awesome. You can listen to entire albums for diverse artists, genres, eras, and take a trip down memory lane, or get caught up on some new artists. Or you can create your own playlists with whatever theme you choose. Unlike other apps, you can choose what artists, and what songs, you want on your lists.",Spotify
Negative,Best music app out there. You can play what you want when you want. Whatever mood you're in you can form a playlist to fit that mood. Premium is definitely worth it!,Spotify
Negative,"You will have a good time with Spotify. You CAN use it, fee free, however Premium is the best. Whatever else you are paying for, each month, make room for this service. All the music you want, when you want it with no library to worry over. Cheers!",Spotify
Negative,"Awesome. Just pure awesome. Any genre, any artist, any song, any mood playlist, whatever, for free. And all you have to deal with are ads (and finding a Wi-Fi zone as well.). And if an artist releases a new album, you can listen to it almost immediately after the release.",Spotify
Negative,"quite possibly the best app for music. I am a premium member so I get to listen to whatever I want, when I want with no adds or added songs. Great selection and I dont think I could live without",Spotify
Negative,"On my S5, this app is amazing. On my fire hd tablet, however, I often times have to manually skip to the next song. For whatever reason it doesn't always play through my entire playlist. It gets annoying. If they fixed that, I would give it a 5 star though.",Spotify
Negative,I love this app I can play whatever song I want on cue and make playlist with my own favorite music,Spotify
Negative,"I LOVE Spotify!! I can search and listen to anyone I want, even bands that are barely around anymore!! I hate commercial interruptions, so I signed up for the monthly service, and I couldn't be happier!!",Spotify
Negative,Best app for listening to whatever you want to hear no matter what the genre. Great discount for college students as well!,Spotify
Negative,Great selection of music. Hate that it's shuffle play only and that random songs play based on your other selections. I wish premium was cheaper so I could play anything I wanted. I really like that there's a vast selection of kid songs for my 2 and 6 yr old children.,Spotify
Negative,This is the best music app ever! You can listen to pretty much whatever you want even full albums with little ads or go premium and have no ads. Worth downloading and trying out.,Spotify
Negative,"Spotify let's you listen to whatever song you want. You can repeat songs, skip, and randomize your favourite tracks. They also have developed soundtracks for everyday life.",Spotify
Negative,I love spotify the thing is I hate when the stupid commercials comes up but kickass music love Hollywood undead and others yea love the music,Spotify
Negative,"Now, when I first got the app about two years ago or so, it was a different app. You could listen to the songs you wanted and save them to listen to later, and listen to whatever, as long as you had WiFi (unless you had premium), and listen to sponsored apps every handful of songs. It was great.  Now days, ads cut off the ending of songs, it crashes, freezes up, and you really need a premium account if you want to do anything. It seems as though they are more desperate for money, and I get that. The thing is, 10 dollars is something a lot of people might not be able to pay, yet they want to listen to music too.  It's made me happy in the past, but lately it's just disappointing me.",Spotify
Negative,One of my favorite music on demand apps. Lots of music . I just wish the music search was more like searching for a song on YouTube. Where you can type whatever lyrics you know and it matches. Spot iffy doesn't have this search tool on par yet with you tube .,Spotify
Negative,"Spotify was great until you need to get premium to listen to what ever song you wanted instead of the shuffle. It was my favorite app, but I have to resort to YouTube now to listen to whatever song I want to hear.",Spotify
Negative,"WOW! This is a rare thing too see. This app has every single song I like too listen to with few exceptions. Also new music comes in frequently. Its something you truely have to get to understand and apperciate how awesome it is. Also it is completely free of charge unless you go premium, which turns off ads and lets you listen offline. You can even listen to music as you read or play games or whatever you do on your mobile device. Way better than Pandora or other music services like that. User for 2 years 10/10 stars ---Official_Notbatman :D (Review made on 24 December 2014)",Spotify
Negative,"It is so nice to not have to listen to it as a radio, like Pandora and Google Play Music. Instead, listen to whatever the heck you want.",Spotify
Negative,"On the Apple version, you get to play any music whenever you want without premium. As a drummer, I need to be able to play specific songs. Don't hate Amazon users, let them have truly free music.",Spotify
Negative,I love spotify but for whatever reason the app won't open sometimes and when it does it freezes and I have to restart my phone to makeit close. II'm not sure if it's the app or my s****y BlackBerry,Spotify
Negative,I lobe how I can listen to about every song but I REALLY HATE that it keeps playing &#34;recommended song&#34; more than my actual songs I have on my playlist . I liked it better before the upgrade,Spotify
Negative,I love the app on my phone. I went to go download it onto my kindle fire (first edition) and I cant install it. i have enough storage for it. im not sure if its a problem with my model or the app but whatever it is it has to be quickly fixed because this is the only music app I use.,Spotify
Negative,Great app. The only thing I think should change is that you should be able to listen to the songs in whatever order you want without having to purchasing Spotify premium .,Spotify
Negative,"I hated the idea of having to pay to listen to music. I tried the free week and thought it was great. When the sale came around for 3 months for just a dollar, I said why not. I use it every day now.",Spotify
Negative,I really love this music app but honestly i hate the new update and how you can now only skip a minimum of times and now you can listen to any song you want unless you go premium.,Spotify
Negative,"When I can get into it, it's good. But 70% of the time I can't log in to it........So it's not good at all........ :(",Spotify
Negative,"I'm not tech savvy but this app is great. You can easily make your own playlist of all you favorite songs or discover new music from your friends. It has all the latest hits or 50s music, whatever you feel like listening to, spotify has it!",Spotify
Negative,"One of the best apps out there. Well worth the premium price. Anybody who loves HQ music and hates ads, should purchase a membership. One of the few apps that I use everyday. Furthermore, it is very rare that I can't find music that I want.",Spotify
Negative,"Amazing, but the updates seem endless and I hate that the play queue is gone now.",Spotify
Negative,Sooooo awesome other than premium that you can buy it completely free. And i hate mp3 players they always end up breaking and now i dont have to buy one and all the songs are free just wish they didnt have adds. But other than that i think this app is plain awesome.,Spotify
Negative,Spotify is an awesome app and you can listen to so many songs!!! It's so fun and I love putting my head phones on and singing along to whatever song!!!,Spotify
Negative,Spotifys New update is not good at all. You can't play the song you want when you want you have certain amount of skips. It is starting to get like Pandora which is not good at all.,Spotify
Negative,The music is good offline but the suggested songs are not good it's like let me listen to what I want!!!!!,Spotify
Negative,One of the best music apps I've used. They offer variety of playlist for you to choose from. They also give you the opportunity to make your own. Whatever mood or genre you are looking for they have it. Including book and motivational speeches.,Spotify
Negative,"honestly this is so much better than pandora.yea whatever pandora is pretty cool,but with spotify you can pick yoir own music like thats so much better (((:",Spotify
Negative,"It's been said before but this service is f-in amazing. I have five decades of music in my head and whatever I think of- is there. Music is our shared culture, it shouldn't be locked in a vault. It should be available for us to enjoy.",Spotify
Negative,Able to find whatever I am in the mood to listen too.,Spotify
Negative,This is the best app for listening to music. Whatever song you want. Anytime. I love it so much. If you are looking for an AMAZING music app that's free you found it. Love it.,Spotify
Negative,Love love love this app. Not good on new or old hip-hop and a lot of r n b I like but still found hundreds of songs I do enjoy. No mixtapes AT ALL. Fix that and it would be perfect,Spotify
Negative,This is an awesome app u can listen to whatever u want and the best part this is free except that u need premium to be app-free but everything else is great,Spotify
Negative,"Now, when I first got the app about two years ago or so, it was a different app. You could listen to the songs you wanted and save them to listen to later, and listen to whatever, as long as you had WiFi (unless you had premium), and listen to sponsored a",Spotify
Negative,I can listen to whatever I want______,Spotify
Negative,This is a music lovers dream. Works great on my Fire. Listen to whatever you want occasional advertising not much though.,Spotify
Negative,It's really nice if you like music as much as I do. I just hate that u need to be premium to get no ads and have it offline.,Spotify
Negative,Way better than Pandora love it ! If there's anyone out there that has Pandora but hates it switched to this !,Spotify
Negative,"Very nice app for pc and cellphone, to take music with you whatever you go",Spotify
Negative,"The music is amazing  I really think you should get this game music app whatever you want to call it",Spotify
Negative,THIS IS THE BEST RADIO APP EVER every one who hates Pandora needs to get this app. All my favorite songs are on this app !Á!Á!Á!Á!Á!Á!Á!Á!,Spotify
Negative,Great sound quality and cheap subscription. Not good for radio but great for playlists,Spotify
Negative,"If you like Pandora but hated the fact you couldn't choose the songs, I recommend this app, especially when you upgrade to premium where there are no ads AND being able to listen to your jams offline. They have a great selection of music and personalized playlists. 10/10",Spotify
Negative,"I hate that I have to play the playlist and can't choose what song I want. I also hate that I can't rewind the current song, play the song again, or go back to a previous song. The iPad app is much more user-friendly.",Spotify
Negative,This app is by far my favorite you can look up whatever songs you want and listen with only one seven second ad every ten songs and it isn't the cheap version. Best of all ITS TOTALLY FREE!!!!!!!!!,Spotify
Negative,I love this app! It has a lot of music really good just hate the ads though but still worth it,Spotify
Negative,Music is truely my life and whatever mood I'm in I can find the perfect song. I found music I love that I never knew existed. Thank you Spotify for giving me the right music when I need it the most.,Spotify
Negative,I hate the Spotify ads.,Spotify
Negative,"Best music app ever Never really knew about spotify until now and it is gr8 You get to choose you own playlist of whatever music you want And you get to listen to radios of ur favorite artists",Spotify
Negative,"Is really awesome, you get to put whatever songs you like",Spotify

Negative,Love being able to listen to whatever I want and making my own play lists. Easy to use and navigate.,Spotify
Negative,"I thought this would be like Pandora or iheart radio but it's all much better, I can listen to whatever I want and not hear random songs out of nowhere but what I want.",Spotify
Negative,"The UI is streamlined and easy to use. The selection is great. This is THE app to be able to listen to whatever you want when you want it.  ESPECIALLY if you're a premium subscriber.",Spotify
Negative,It's a great app but I hate that shuffle play thing,Spotify
Negative,I love being able to listen to whatever I want . It's also super cool to have the shazaam playlist.,Spotify
Negative,Love the fact that no matter where you are or whatever you are feeling Spotify has it all...,Spotify
Negative,"Spotlight is the best. I listen to whatever I want, when ever I want. There's little to no commercials and I don't need to skip songs cause they only play the artists you want to listen to.",Spotify
Negative,Love the app! But I hate that the skip button isn't allowed on the mobile app.,Spotify
Negative,"I have encountered no problems. Easily find whatever I'm looking for. Ads are unobtrusive. Imo, beats Pandora by a long shot. Highly recommended.",Spotify
Negative,"I can pretty much get whatever songs or albums I choose. That's the great part about Spotify, you can get albums and not just songs like Pandora and those other music types for mp3's.",Spotify
Negative,"I love spotify, but I hate their restriction of letting you download music to at most 3 devices ! Today it is not uncommon to own more than that!!",Spotify
Negative,I hate having to say something. 5 stars. Enough said.,Spotify
Negative,I like the app but i hate the ads and the fact you cant choose a song to play bothers me,Spotify
Negative,Excellent app. I love how you can listen to your own music and you don't have to listen to the music you hate. Best music app ever!,Spotify
Negative,I love to listen to music so this is great for whatever I'm doing!!,Spotify
Negative,"You can listen to whatever you want whenever you want and they even have remixes, and clean versions! So sign up (Its 100% free) and listen today!!!",Spotify
Negative,"I love being able to look up whatever I want to hear and listen to it, and add it to a playlist!",Spotify
Negative,You should get this app!It's the best thing EVER!You can play whatever music you want when you want,Spotify
Negative,"If you're like me, you dream of owning your own radio station and playing WHATEVER music you want...With Spotify, you CAN! (Sorta) Millions of songs to choose from and make your own playlists. And may I recommend Vitamin String Quartet, they have HUNDREDS of songs from all genres, all played by a string quartet....for those times at work when you want to rock out to The Foo Fighters, but have to be in a professional setting, Vitamin String Quartet can fill your musical needs! Spotify is my favorite music app of all time! I am the DJ!",Spotify
Negative,"I would happily say that this app is EXTRAORDINARY it has everything u want and need in music Pros: All the music you LOVE Every single artist ever known (even if they aren't good) Make your own playlists Listen to whatever you want It awesome Keeps u updated on the new songs  Cons: You need premium to listen instead of shuffle play Explicit content (for all u kids out there....what would your parents think)  I recommend this app for everyone they has a kindle and you should download it NO CHARGE!!!",Spotify
Negative,Its is a lot easier than Pandora I hate pandora,Spotify
Negative,Very great source for music and programming to listen to while you're at home or on the go. I do recommend that you use this only at home since it might run up your limited data plan. The sound quality is above CD quality and the service has a very good library. It beats filling up your phone with songs and ending up running out of space. Spotify does not have everything and sometimes they limit what you can listen to based where you are located because of those copyrights. I have the premium subscription because I hate the commercials in the middle of the listening sessions.,Spotify
Negative,"Just purchased this item and have not had the time to really get to know all the aspects of this purchase. However, I HAVE used it everyday and thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app. It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well. Since it is Christmas time, it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums. Very nice. Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now. One thing I don't understand is how this service is available for free. It does have a few commercials, VERY few. It just doesn't make any sense to me, but I'm not complaining. Really nice service or app or whatever you call it. I think it's great!!!",Spotify
Negative,This is a amazing muisic app! You cam creat your own playlists and listen to whatever YOU want! I use it all the time!,Spotify
Negative,You can create playlists. Listen to whatever song you want whenever you want. And browse through playlists and more. And it's free. Best music app ever.,Spotify
Negative,"Really cool music app, lets you play whatever music you want whenever, ehich I love. Would be five stars if it weren't so glitchy all the time.",Spotify
Negative,I live this app because you can listen to whatever you want for free offline too.,Spotify
Negative,On tablet you can choose whatever you want but on phone you have to do shuffle play,Spotify
Negative,Great app!! Awesome variety to suit whatever you're in the mood for!!,Spotify
Negative,"I like how it downloads music & attempts to find other bands that are related to the Genre of music. Problem is, I can't seem to play the ""PLAY LIST"" that I organized, set-up, or whatever. Like every time I attempt to play a certain album or band or whatever, I click on that ""Play List"" & I can't get what I want; it plays the ""RADIO"" it sets up for you. It is frustrating to not be able to play what I want to hear, just what Spotify thinks I want to hear.",Spotify
Negative,"Good app, but i hate adds",Spotify
Negative,I can you play whatever I want when I want. Great for relaxing or working out. Many songs to choose and it shows their most popular songs.,Spotify
Negative,I have always used spotlight and can listen to whatever I like cuz they got it unlike some apps out there.,Spotify
Negative,"I really enjoy listing to music of my choosing anytime. I like that I can save whatever song I hear for later, it's just the best!",Spotify
Negative,"I can practically find whatever I want and make my own play list! I have my clean, XxxX, work out, and dance play list",Spotify
Negative,"Whatever mood you're in, there's great music to listen to.",Spotify
Negative,"I love that they have stations for every mood you could possibly have. That you can have playlists and saved songs and follow artists. Don't even mind the million of ads or that unless you buy premium you can only skip 5 or 6 songs per half hour or whatever. It's awesome they have new albums the day they come out. What annoys the crap outta me is if I'm listening to my playlist, the constant interruption of 'suggested' songs. I'm listening to a playlist I created because I specifically want to hear those exact songs NOT random songs. But other than that I love the app.",Spotify
Negative,I like spotify but I don't like that I have to shuffle and get whatever I get on my kindle or phone.,Spotify
Negative,"OK most people say that it sucks without premium, but i don't have premium and all it is, is that you have to listen to a few adds now and then , trust me its not that bad! I highly recommend the app!",Spotify
Negative,I really like it. But having to go through a whole album just to get the one song you want is the worst. That is only bad thing.,Spotify
Negative,"This app pretty good to bad it doesn't some underground music and Japanese rock music. I haven't run into any problem of finding music or commercials, that's if you pay your subscription.",Spotify
Negative,"Spotify, isn't too bad. I like it however I don't think you should have to buy premium for some of the features. Other wise excellent app.",Spotify
Negative,"This app is a must have. Nothing bad to say.. Highly recommend! Don't take my word for it, download it and see for yourself.",Spotify
Negative,This app allow you to download most songs not all because they might not be there the only bad thing is the amount of skips you have an you have to be a member to play a song you want to hear instead of it being on shuffle which you can't get rid if unless you are a member.,Spotify
Negative,"I don't want to sound as if I am being cheap, but I've been waiting to put it on my Kindle without being charged for a long time. Why they didn't do this sooner I'll never know. It works very well for my needs and I am glad to have on my Kindle. I can now listen and enjoy the music I want. For those who gave this a three stars or lower I am sorry you did. It has a few bad points, but you have to over look them and move on. I mean for its free, and there's nothing perfect these days. Take my word for it, down load it and enjoy. It's free what more do you want?",Spotify
Negative,You can't see the thriller behind what the break of dawn it has. Don't stop till you get enough of this app. It is so good for being bad like a jam.,Spotify
Negative,Easy to use and nice selection of music. B it a bad price either. Capable of streaming and downloading high quality sounding music. Good all around service.,Spotify
Negative,"This is a great app because: 1)You get a 7 day free trial of free music when u make an account. 2)Music is clear and not bad.  Discovering New music every day!",Spotify
Negative,"You can not download any song you find. It's very unique as far as genres also it has best of the best tracks from backbin the day. ONLY BAD PART YOUR NOT ABLE TO DOWLOAD ANY SONGS. TO YOUR DRVICE.____",Spotify
Negative,Its was good at first i was loving it but now after this new update its gone bad you can't play your own music you can find the song but you can't play it with out shuffle play so yeah,Spotify
Negative,I find nearly everything I want to listen too. Nothing bad to say,Spotify
Negative,Really enjoy this app. Even the ads aren't that bad. Except when you're in the mIddle of a guided meditation playlist :P,Spotify
